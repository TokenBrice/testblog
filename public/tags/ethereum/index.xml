        <title>The Pegged Asset Swap Wars</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/pegged-assets-swap-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Pegged Asset Swap Wars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, it’s been a while! As you likely know, liquidity management is both my passion and profession. In this article, I aim to revisit the basics and offer a brief history through the lens of pegged asset swaps. As we detail the liquidity structure and venues that best support those pairs, we will gain a deeper understanding of key concepts that remain critical to navigating that space today. We also get the chance to cover Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, the two most interesting releases of the year for liquidity-building who definitely deserved more airtime around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-days-of-pegged-asset-swaps-2018-2019&#34;&gt;The Early Days of Pegged Asset Swaps (2018-2019)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, more than half a decade ago, &lt;strong&gt;all we had to swap on the mainnet were Uniswap, Bancor, and some clunky order-book-based DEXes like EtherDelta.&lt;/strong&gt; So, when it came to pegged asset swaps, the options were minimal, and we were using the Uniswap V2 USDC/USDT pool, which was akin to sheer insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom in on this historical trivia to understand &lt;strong&gt;the level of waste that was achieved&lt;/strong&gt; at that time. When it comes to liquidity pools, the key parameter is the relative evolution of the two assets&amp;rsquo; prices: if you have done any volatile LPing, you’re deeply familiar with that. If you LP say LINK/ETH, the max pain for you, in terms of impermanent loss, is, for instance, ETH shooting up while LINK is dumping: your LP position decreases in ETH (which goes up in price), and accrues LINK (which is falling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USDC/USDT is another story, though, as the two assets are deeply correlated, with a maximum price difference ever seen between them of around 10% during a specific event (the USDC SVB depeg); in regular times, the two have a price difference in the basis point range. However, UNIv2 distributes the liquidity across the entire price range, meaning it allocates an equal amount of liquidity anywhere from 1 USDC = 0.0000000001 USDT to 1 USDC = 10000000000000 USDT. To put it simply: 99.9% of the liquidity in a UNIv2_USDC/USDT will never be utilized. I think it’s clearer on the graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/liquidity-structure.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquidity-structures&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only valuable liquidity there (assuming 1 USDC ≃ 1 USDT) is located at the intersection of the two green lines, making up a very minimal share of the entire liquidity distribution curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, note the stableswap liquidity distribution, displayed in blue, on the same graph. For assets at similar prices, the area covered by the curve is much greater than with the Uniswap invariant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stableswap-revolution-for-pegged-assets-swaps-2020&#34;&gt;The StableSwap Revolution for Pegged Assets Swaps (2020)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once StableSwap was available, stablecoin liquidity quickly migrated there, as it was significantly more efficient (we’re talking &amp;gt;100x improvements in efficiency vs UNIv2). It was &lt;strong&gt;the first live instance ever seen of Concentrated Liquidity on mainnet, before UNIv3&lt;/strong&gt;. The two are difficult to compare, as UNIv3 is much more flexible, while Curve-StableSwap is more specialized; however, kudos must be given where due. Along with increased efficiency, Curve provided an incentive model - veCRV+CRV emissions, which has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-wars/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;covered several times on this blog already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives are critical for pegged asset pairs, as they have some specific characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to be overall &lt;strong&gt;low-volume&lt;/strong&gt; (compared to a volatile pairing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The fees LP can charge are much lower **(up until recently, the convention was 0.3% to 1% per trade for volatile assets, and 0.05% for pegged assets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their volume comes in spikes&lt;/strong&gt; correlated to events associated with the coin (ex, USDC depeg was one of the highest volume days ever for USDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of the above, I thought until very recently that incentivization structures were even more critical for pegged asset pairs than for volatile assets. With the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, I don’t think it’s the case anymore. However, before we delve into them, we must first address another significant historical milestone in pegged assets liquidity: the release of Uniswap V3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-arrival-of-uniswap-v3-concentrated-liquidity-2021&#34;&gt;The arrival of Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity (2021)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniswap V3 released and delivered customizable concentrated liquidity to essentially every asset type, enabling massive efficiency gains for all liquidity providers. However, since it wasn’t just for pegged assets, it almost meant amplified impermanent losses for volatile assets LPs. Considering the novelty of the liquidity structure, along with the lack of infrastructure in the early days, the launch of UNIv3 was initially slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the customizable concentration delivered tangible benefits, especially for a subcategory of pegged assets I branded “loosely pegged assets”: think of pairs like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wstETH/ETH (correlated, but wstETH is up-only against ETH),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LUSD/USDC (correlated, but LUSD can slightly over/under-peg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such cases, &lt;strong&gt;UNIv3 concentrated liquidity enabled LPs to replicate a distribution similar in efficiency to Curve’s Stableswap but adjusted to the tokens&amp;rsquo; price action particularities&lt;/strong&gt;, and it translated once again into massive efficiency gains. However, the final unlock (as of the current industry state) was only to come years later with the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debt-as-liquidity-2025&#34;&gt;Debt as liquidity (2025)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t delve too deeply into the models of Fluid and EulerSwap in this post for conciseness, as I want to focus more on what it means for liquidity building. Simply put, Fluid found a creative way to transform debt into liquidity with “Smart Debt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture an average user supplying ETH collateral and borrowing USDC. Does he specifically want USDC? Most likely, he doesn’t care as long as he’s borrowing a safe and stable USD-pegged coin. He’d likely take USDT as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is precisely what smart debt does. In a smart debt vault, our borrower borrows a mix of USDC and USDT, which constantly evolves: his debt now serves as liquidity for the USDC/USDT pair. What that means for the borrowers is &lt;strong&gt;reduced borrowing cost, as he now earns trading fees&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially enabling him to offset the borrowing interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/fluid-smart-debt.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;fluid-smart-debt&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s from the borrower’s perspective, but now let’s switch to a protocol mindset. What does this mean for Circle and Tether? Essentially, &lt;strong&gt;liquidity at virtually 0 costs, with no form of incentivization whatsoever.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing really new there for Circle who has been sponsored by the whole ecosystem for years – but for another stablecoin, say a GHO, BOLD, or FRAX, that is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on Fluid here, but the thought process is similar for EulerSwap, although the implementation is different. EulerSwap is still in testing mode and already printing serious volume on USDC/USDT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand this, you can reach my thesis, which simply states, “I don’t see a DeFi where Euler/Fluid/Similar do not eventually dominate pegged-assets swaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seeing it yet? Remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegged assets pairs are usually low volume ⇒ low fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, they require heavy incentivization to maintain on a classical DEX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluid and Euler can sustain this liquidity at close to no cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ If (it already started) there is a race to the bottom in terms of fees for pegged asset swaps, regular DEXes have exactly 0% chances of winning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;0xorb-a-potential-challenger-2026&#34;&gt;0xOrb, a potential challenger (~2026)?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, to give you an accurate picture of the whole pegged asset swap landscape, I must mention another project not live yet, but promising: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://orbswap.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;0xOrb&lt;/a&gt;. The promise is simple: &lt;strong&gt;stableswap, but with n assets, n being able to go up to 1000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance, for stablecoin, you could picture a mega-pool well supplied in USDC and USDT, that then proceed to onboard “alternative” stablecoins and offer them great liquidity against the majors. The approach has merits for the long-tail of pegged assets, but I don’t see such pools dominating the core volume (USDC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;USDT or cbBTC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;wBTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, such pools could be cross-chain, although I think the benefit here is absolutely marginal if not &lt;strong&gt;detrimental&lt;/strong&gt; (⇒ increases the risks and complexity of the infra for no benefits), &lt;strong&gt;since USDC and USDT are increasingly bridgable 1:1 fast between chains thanks to product like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-for-incumbent-pure-dex-players&#34;&gt;What does it mean for incumbent pure-DEX players?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the most significant caveat: we’re discussing pegged asset swaps here. Replicating the same playbook on volatile pairs is much more challenging, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.fluid.io/t/current-issues-with-eth-usdc-pool/1606&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;as seen in Fluid’s Smart Debt+Collateral ETH/USDC vault and the losses its LP incurred&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEXes that generate most of their volume and fees through volatile pairs, such as Aerodrome, are likely not to be impacted by these new entrants. &lt;strong&gt;The reality is, however, much grimmer for DEXes focusing on pegged assets&lt;/strong&gt;, and I want to consider two of these to wrap this article up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curve-game-over-unless-there-are-sizeable-changes&#34;&gt;Curve: game over unless there are sizeable changes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegged assets swaps remain critical for Curve, still seen as the home of stablecoin liquidity. Indeed, there were attempts to capture volatile volume with CryptoSwap, but it proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of Fluid and EulerSwap, I think Curve is the DEX with the most to lose, and I don’t see it maintaining a prominent volume (they have already been kicked out of the top 10 a while ago) unless sizable changes are happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;veCRV revamp&lt;/strong&gt;: harnessing the learnings from newer models like veAERO to optimize the CRV emissions allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased DEX efficiency harnessing crvUSD&lt;/strong&gt;: for instance, by enabling crvUSD loans to Curve LPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new liquidity structure for volatile assets&lt;/strong&gt; : so that Curve can capture the associated volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ekubo-the-confident-latecomer-rushing-to-its-demise&#34;&gt;Ekubo: the confident latecomer rushing to its demise
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekubo’s situation is arguably even worse, as they came only recently to the party. At face value, Ekubo on Ethereum is a fast-growing DEX printing serious volumes. Ekubo is essentially a UNIv4-alt, with slightly more liquidity structure customization and a DAO that proved less extractive than Uniswap’s (the lowest bar of all, but still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in where the volume comes from: the vast majority (&amp;gt;95%) of it is on a USDC/USDT pair with 0.00005% fees and heavily incentivized. Ekubo is essentially playing a race to the bottom it cannot win because Ekubo cannot sustain extremely low fees in the long term (LPs must eat), while Fluid/Euler can (if borrowers receive even a 0.1% yield on their debt, thanks to smart debt, they are better off than without smart debt and thus happy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/ekubo.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;ekubo-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a $2.6M TVL pool, processing ~$130M volume daily for $662 of fees collected daily, incentivized ~8% in EKUBO, they are already fast approaching the limit of what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amusing aspect of all this is that &lt;strong&gt;Ekubo itself initiated the race to the bottom with the USDC/USDT swap fees and will be spectacularly vainquished at its own game&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi never ceases to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I hope this article was insightful and deepened your understanding of the pegged assets swap game. I look forward to getting my character trashed by the Ekubo community simply for stating an opinion driven by facts: their reaction gave me extreme confidence in my assessment, as I have observed the same response when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced MAI&amp;rsquo;s absurd security practices, and it got hacked + depegged shortly after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced R/David Garai&amp;rsquo;s gaslighting and lies, and R proceeded to get hacked into oblivion &amp;lt;6 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I criticized Prisma’s team behavior, and they proceeded to get hacked and shut down the protocol &amp;lt;12 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on. Best of luck to all, especially the EKUBO bag holders – try to have some class in your dismay that would serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leverage Like a Sir: Polynomial Gains, No Liquidation Pains</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/leverage-sir/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/leverage-sir/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/leverage-sir-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Leverage Like a Sir: Polynomial Gains, No Liquidation Pains" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Sir Trading, a fascinating novel DeFi primitive was shipped, and I quickly fell in love with it. I’ve also decided to get involved, so welcome to this article introducing Sir Trading, explaining what I found interesting in the model, and announcing my involvement as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sirtrading-explained-like-a-business&#34;&gt;Sir.Trading explained like a business
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand Sir Trading (and it works well with most protocols), we can use a business metaphor: Who are the customers, intermediaries, and stakeholders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-diagram.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-diagram&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start from the bottom up: our “customers” are the APEs who open leverage positions and pay fees. Everything else is a &amp;ldquo;means&amp;rdquo; to that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second population is the “intermediaries”, the liquidity providers on the Sir Protocol, called TEA holders, also called “gentlemen”. They are necessary because the more TEA liquidity exists, the greater APE’s capacity to lever up, and thus, the more likely users are to ape at scale. Maximizing this population is essential, as it helps to address one of the main weaknesses of the Sir model: the &lt;strong&gt;absence of leverage decay can only be guaranteed if the liquidity provided is sufficient compared to the leveraged position opened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it makes sense to incentivize liquidity providers with SIR emissions to attract liquidity proportional to APE demand. Additionally, continuous SIR rewards provide LPers with stable income, complementing the volatile minting/closing fees they also earn—a critical advantage, as LPers usually prioritize predictability (cf. Aerodrome vs. Uniswap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SIR holders act as stakeholders. They can stake their tokens to receive ETH dividends from fees collected on positions opening and closing and, in the future, could be involved in a mini-governance centered around decisions about resource allocation (⇒ which vaults to incentivize with SIR emissions?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our three core populations defined, we can essentially assemble them into the “business model” of Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-business-model.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-business-model&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIR Protocol aims to maximize its customer base (APE holders), which drives revenue shared with stakeholders (SIR holders). Stakeholders approve SIR emissions to fund intermediaries (TEA LPers) that provide the liquidity necessary to the purpose and allocate it to the vaults most relevant to drive usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zooming-in-on-the-apes-side&#34;&gt;Zooming in on the APE’s side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the protocol&amp;rsquo;s core is the APE—the ability to leverage any asset traded on UniswapV3. But what makes this leverage so interesting, especially compared to the myriad of other options now available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below should answer the most important questions for anyone already familiar with other protocols offering leverage, such as f(x) or Squeeth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Type of Returns
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;polynomial (=/ multiplicative)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Max leverage
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Up to ^5 with no leverage decay given sufficient liquidity, realistically ~ ^2
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Liquidation
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;None
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Rebalancing
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;None
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Fees
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;No funding fees, only set fees paid when opening or closing position
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Assets Supported
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Potentially any traded on UNIv3 + permissionless vault deployment
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Security Considerations
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Protocol to be eventually fully immutable once out of Beta Mode, oracle used is trustless (UNIv3)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, I think the offer is quite compelling even when compared to existing options, although it is a bit “weird” if you are used to other more classical leverage products as you have to wrap your head around a few new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;polynomial-returns&#34;&gt;Polynomial returns?!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let’s tackle &lt;strong&gt;the question of linear (most common) vs polynomial leverage (Sir’s case)&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are not a math buff, I think the first thing to understand about polynomials is that their impact is increasingly more palpable as the price moves farther from the starting price. It is better to be careful, as it works both ways. Let’s illustrate with a hypothetical simplified position started when ETH = $2000 (fees are ignored for simplicity; we’ll come back to them later):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$2500 (+25%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$3000 (+50%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4000 (+100%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;10000 (+400%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Linear - ETH x2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;3 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;18 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Polynomial - ETH ^2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;3 125
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 500
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;8 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;50 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Linear - ETH x5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 500
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;7 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;12 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;42 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Polynomial - ETH ^5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 103.52
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;15 187.5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;64 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 250 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see that last row/column scenario, with our ETH^5 ape reaching a &amp;gt;$6M Valhalla on a mere 1 ETH base position (with a +400% price appreciation)? That’s the power of polynomial returns. What we looked at above is enticing, although it abstracts many factors, including the fees, and assumes no leverage decay for both positions. Picture it as an example of understanding the power of polynomial vs linear in a financial context more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polynomial returns (convex payouts) have historically been overpromised and underdelivered. Delivering them consistently is usually challenging, but they are generally implemented with &lt;strong&gt;corrective factors&lt;/strong&gt; of different natures and names: time decay, volatility decay, leverage decay, etc. The usual model for such a product revolves around &lt;strong&gt;managing loans between traders and lenders&lt;/strong&gt; to keep the leverage as constant as possible. This leads to models where leveragers constantly stream varying fees to lenders and still see their positions often rebalanced. With Sir, this correcting factor is clear and explicit upfront – that is that steep fee, so let’s dive right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fee-structure&#34;&gt;Fee Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the fee model, which is also quite different from the usual. Sir fees are fixed, dependant on your leverage, and charged ½ at position opening (APE minting) and ½ at position closing (APE redemption). At first glance, they might seem quite steep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Leverage
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Total Fees
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;^1.5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;17.35% of principal
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;^5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;69.13% of principal
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom in on an ETH/USDC^1.5 position to understand better the impact of the polynomial leverage and the Sir’s fees, with a hypothetical position opened at ETH = $2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-calculator.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-calculator&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ETH = $4000 (+100%), such position is up ~17% in ETH terms or ~134% in USD terms. Of course, by this point, you are a polynomial leverage expert, and thus you understand that &lt;strong&gt;the gap between the ETH/USDC^1.5 and raw ETH holding increases the further the price appreciates&lt;/strong&gt;. At ETH = $6000 (+200%), the position is now up ~43% vs ETH or ~330% vs USD. At ETH = $8000, we are now at ~65% gains vs ETH and ~562% vs USD. Again, this works the same way in reverse; please remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this explicits well the “goal of the game” with Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, you want to seize a nice dip + reversal to open your position on a favorable price and quickly earn enough returns to cover the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your goal is then to seize the maximal spread between your opening and closing price, knowing that each % you can grab provides exponentially more returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product&amp;rsquo;s design is well-suited for such plays since you do not have to worry about funding fees or time decay. You’re essentially looking to buy low and sell high; welcome to crypto: except this time, you have a tool amplifying your returns the more you manage to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its fee structure, &lt;strong&gt;Sir is geared toward leveragers with a long-term perspective&lt;/strong&gt;, which matches its other key features (no liquidation, no leverage decay). Overall, the fees paid are similar to those that would be incurred maintaining a margin position for a year, striking a balance between potential returns, protocol stability, and upfront costs. When opening a leveraged position, one of the main concerns is getting the timing wrong and chopped by range-bound price action, where the fees accumulate and take away any potential profits; this concern is non-existent in Sir’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to remind you one more time of the main limitation of Sir: the absence of liquidity decay can only be ensured if there is sufficient liquidity to stomach your trade. While it’s pretty &lt;strong&gt;reasonable to assume so for incentivized ^1.25, ^1.5, or even ^2 vaults&lt;/strong&gt;, it becomes much less certain for ^5 vaults, even with strong incentives, because of the maths I shared above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like more data to understand the impact of polynomial leverage in the context of Sir (=fees included), check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.sir.trading/leverage-calculator&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the new calculator on the Sir website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: APE tokens are ERC-20; thus, further composability could be envisioned. It could get interesting as the protocol grows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-the-tea-drinkers&#34;&gt;What about the TEA drinkers?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a decent understanding of the demand side, the APE/leveragers, let’s jump to the other side, the liquidity providers/TEA holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: TEA drinkers are essentially ~counter-trading APEs, as they provide the liquidity APE redeem against if they manage to earn and secure (redeem) sizable gains. When I say “counter-trading” here, I mean it similarly as a UNIv2_ETH/USDC LP is counter-trading the market: when the market is mostly buying ETH (⇒ price goes up), the liquidity providing positions are rebalancing to USDC, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even more simply, &lt;strong&gt;TEA holders are shorter against the underlying asset than if they were just holding it&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding this is all you need to be able to project the impact of price variants on your principal. You also have to &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind the liquidity utilization,&lt;/strong&gt; as if you are supplying to a vault where there is little/no aping, you are counter-trading little to no one, and your principal exposure becomes similar to a naked raw holding of the underlying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TEA holders are “shorter” compared to a naked raw holding of the underlying asset, they remain exposed to its price appreciation.  You can &lt;strong&gt;think of TEA holders as ETH/USD^0-1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the principal cleared out, let’s address the earnings as a TEA holder. It’s pretty straightforward: by default, &lt;strong&gt;TEA holders of a given vault collectively earn all the fees incurred by the APE minters&lt;/strong&gt;. Fees are earned in such (same token as the supplied token) and autocompounded. TEA holders can redeem them when burning their position to recover their principal + all the fees accrued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fees earned based on aping activity, &lt;strong&gt;some vaults are also incentivized with&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;streams of SIR emissions.&lt;/strong&gt; These currently include the most utilized: ETH/USDC1.5, wBTC/USDT1.5, SIR/ETH1.5, and SIR/ETH5. When vaults are incentivized with SIR emissions, ~10% of the fees incurred by the APE are redirected to SIR stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: TEA tokens are ERC-1155, limiting further composability, which is a good thing here, as you want to avoid restaking-type situations on those tokens, which are critical to the protocol&amp;rsquo;s proper functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;noteworthy-features&#34;&gt;Noteworthy features
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above, you should already have a decent understanding of the protocol, so rather than boring you with expansive explanations of each subtleties, I’ll instead zoom in on a few features of Sir I found worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trustlessness-maximization&#34;&gt;Trustlessness maximization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My blog readers will not be surprised to find a section addressing this, as maximal decentralization and trustlessness are my mantras. In that regard, Sir Trading fares quite well, and the design demonstrates the priority given to those two topics by its founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the most important – the potential immutability of the protocol. Considering its novel approach and the risks associated with it, making the protocol immediately fully immutable could be inconsequential. Instead, the approach developed here is a progressive path to eventual immutability with four modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-beta-mode.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-beta-mode&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir is currently in Training Wheels mode, in which some parameters, such as the fees can still be adjusted. From the Training Wheels mode, it can switch to Emergency in response to a bug or exploit and from here to a Shutdown (⇒ Redeploy) if needed. On the other hand, if all goes well, the training wheels can be removed, and the protocol can be switched to Unstoppable mode, where it becomes immutable. I find this approach balanced and interesting, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.sir.trading/protocol-overview/beta-period&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;definitely worthy of studying&lt;/a&gt; for other builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the oracle solution chosen, a critical element for any lending or leverage-based protocol. Here, &lt;strong&gt;the solution is simple and fully trustless: Uniswap v3.&lt;/strong&gt; It, of course, has limits, most notably the liquidity available on Uniswap to ensure the price is not easily manipulated. However, considering the top vaults are majors like ETH or wBTC, it’s not a big concern. It could be more of an issue for SIR-related vaults, but here again, the liquidity is reasonably sufficient compared to the token market cap (TVL in pools &amp;gt; 35% FDV). Further mitigation is implemented on the UNIv3 oracle (30 min TWAP) to resist price manipulation better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature in terms of trustlessness and resilience is the &lt;strong&gt;harnessing of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.sir.trading/protocol-overview/token-auctions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;token auctions&lt;/a&gt; to streamline fee distribution to stakers&lt;/strong&gt;. Sir is far from the only one doing this, as, for instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.euler.finance/developers/periphery/fee-flow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Euler Finance harnesses a similar logic&lt;/a&gt;. Such auctions enable the conversion of many assets into one (in this case, wETH) without adding unnecessary compromises to the protocol. I expect to see even more of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Xatarrer (founder) has self-submitted a DeFiScan review for Sir Trading, which is currently under review. Please check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defiscan.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiScan&lt;/a&gt; once the review is published for more details regarding Sir&amp;rsquo;s decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocol-owned-liquidity&#34;&gt;Protocol Owned Liquidity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is Sir&amp;rsquo;s lifeblood, and the protocol design acknowledges this with &lt;strong&gt;a keen focus on growing permanent liquidity (TEA) reserves&lt;/strong&gt;. Every liquidity provider deposit includes a fee (~8.99% of their principal) retained as permanent protocol-owned liquidity. Thus, incentivizing LPers with SIR isn’t just &amp;ldquo;renting&amp;rdquo; liquidity—it’s also an immediate partial &amp;ldquo;buyout&amp;rdquo; of their deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this, as the protocol grows and can attract more liquidity providers, it builds permanent liquidity reserves, enabling an ever-increasing “minimal guaranteed liquidity for APEs”. It’s essentially a virtuous loop progressively solving one of the main drawbacks of the model: elegant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-token-emission-model&#34;&gt;Continuous Token Emission Model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIR works under a &lt;strong&gt;constant emission model at the rate of 2015M SIR per year&lt;/strong&gt;, with the lion’s share always going to incentivize liquidity providers. There is, however, a switch in the distribution logic, made to give the protocol the means for its early growth in the first three years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first 3 years, 68.13 % directed to liquidity providers, 13.65 % to pre-mainnet contributors, 10 % reserved in a treasury, and 8.22 % to investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that: 100% to liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is efficient, as no vesting is needed for the team/investors/treasury, since the logic is wholly shifted here: you have to think in terms of streams of tokens (X SIR/day) instead of total balance and associated vesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-your-understanding-in-practice&#34;&gt;Putting your understanding in practice
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap things up, we can now articulate our shared understanding of the protocol by studying three different market hypotheses articulated into strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bullish-eth-or-btc-over-a-midlong-time-frame&#34;&gt;“I am bullish ETH or BTC over a mid/long time frame”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is the most straightforward; it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as minting the ETH/USDC^1.5 APE token. The absence of liquidation and funding fees will allow you to set this position and forget about it. &lt;strong&gt;Your primary metric to watch for here is the opening+closing fee at 17.35%: you need to seize a ~26% price appreciation on ETH to enter profit territory&lt;/strong&gt;, with your gains increasing in a polynomial fashion from thereon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish BTC: all the same, except using the wBTC/USDT^1.5 APE (main vault: good amount of liquidity available).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish ETH against BTC and looking for adrenaline: all the same, except using the wETH/wBTC^5 vault (careful, low liquidity right now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish SIR against ETH: you have several tiers of leverage available to express that conviction onchain (SIR/ETH^1.5 and SIR/ETH^5 being the most liquid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bearing-eth-over-a-midlong-time-frame&#34;&gt;“I am bearing ETH over a mid/long time frame”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really?! No judgment; there is also a vault for that, in the name of USDC/wETH^1.5! Because this vault is USDC based, against ETH, opening an APE position there means going short ETH with polynomial leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inversely, supplying that vault as a liquidity provider (TEA) means counter-trading the (potential) shorters ⇒ being long ETH (if there is utilization), but from a USDC base this time. However, this vault is not incentivized with SIR emissions currently, so your earnings will stem only from APEs opening positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bullish-sir-but-not-really-a-leverage-hungry-ape&#34;&gt;“I am bullish SIR, but not really a leverage-hungry APE”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s understandable; not everyone is a thrill-maxxer. Here, you could consider &lt;strong&gt;harnessing the constant emissions to liquidity providers to build your SIR stash over time and only at capital opportunity cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Considering the LP supply fee, you are “forced” to sustain the position for a few weeks/months to reduce the fee&amp;rsquo;s impact. If you are worried about principal depreciation in the case of a significant market reversal upward, you could consider splitting your deposits over several incentivized vaults to hedge for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you initially farm with an ETH or wBTC deposit, you have a compounding option with your freshly farmed SIR: supplying the SIR vaults. Also, consider staking your SIR to maximize a mid/long-term SIR position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussing-my-involvement&#34;&gt;Discussing My Involvement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you, I’d like to give you more context on my involvement with Sir: I am advising the Sir team to help them with my core topics: growth, tokenomics optimization, and BD. I am compensated for this endeavour, and I am also an APE and TEA holder and, therefore, a SIR farmer – &lt;strong&gt;I am long SIR in all possible ways&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered Sir somewhat recently (the protocol is still just a few weeks old), but the timing was excellent. As those following me on Twitter probably already know, I have been profoundly disappointed with f(x), where I suffered from an abusive liquidation stemming from infrastructure shortcomings on their end (RPCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was, since then, on the hunt for an alternative solution to f(x) and stumbled upon Sir, which delivers some similar features (“real” no liquidation, no funding fees) but also brings welcome additions to the mix, such as the polynomial leverage vs linear: both the protocol and the timing were perfect, so going the extra mile to help it succeed happened very spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not approach advisory as a collectible to add to my wallet, show in 2 monthly calls, collect the payout, and call it a day. I am on the opposite side, equally maximally committed, involved, and selective with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Sir, considering the recency of the protocol, my current contributions revolve around raising awareness for the protocol, helping it get well integrated into the ecosystem, and expliciting its benefits to as many people as possible, as done with this article. I harness my extensive DeFi experience, network, and presence to support the team in all relevant ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-valhalla-or-hell-nothing-in-between-position&#34;&gt;My “Valhalla or hell, nothing in-between” position
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5f9038d9004b53501bdf05b3f30d8fc8fd2d8da6a89299a624276c7605bf4ea7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;I opened a ^5 SIR position on my public wallet tokenbrice.eth&lt;/a&gt; – feel free to track it: 500K SIR levered ^5 ⇒ redeemable for ~155K SIR at inception (~69% fees), opened on Mar-04-2025 08:34:47 PM UTC. If all goes well, I hope to eventually redeem this for ~8M SIR (⇒ SIR at 2x my starting price, assuming sufficient liquidity) and do something fun with it. &lt;strong&gt;I want to remind you that such leverage is the closest you can get to onchain insanity; this position is now known in the community as “Valhalla or hell, no in-between”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: As a protocol built for resilience, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/DeFiCollective_/status/1897575989032497390&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Sir is also supported by the DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;, which received a SIR donation, matched it with ETH, initiated and supplied the UNIv2 LP, and locked the LP token for one year to secure a liquidity baseline on the token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article and the above strategy are not investment advice but practical illustrations of what the protocol can do. You make your own decisions, and you are responsible for them. In case that wasn’t clear enough with the previous warnings: I am exposed to SIR as a token and protocol and stand to benefit from its growth; in other words, I am maximally aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeFi’s UX Disaster: Curation Could Save Innovation</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-ux-disaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-ux-disaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2025/defi-ux-disaster/defi-ux-disaster-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post DeFi’s UX Disaster: Curation Could Save Innovation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone worries about the infrastructure and app layers, and that’s cute, but what about the curation layer? Without it, the two others are nearly useless, as the complexity of the space is already far too great for most of the population to handle. So today, I want to plead to address the most significant lack in DeFi, informed by my experience with over six years spent educating people about it, onboarding pretty much anyone willing in my surroundings and online, and following up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-the-infrastructure-application-and-curation-layers&#34;&gt;Defining the infrastructure, application, and curation layers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move forward, we need to align on the key terms – those three layers. An image is worth a thousand words, so let’s study an interesting example taken from the wild that features bits of each of the three layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/defi-ux-disaster/jumper.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;jumper-exchange&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty dense flow involving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereum mainnet (infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wBTC (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayan bridge (infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave on Optimism (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USDC (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumper (application + curation), powered by Li.FI (infrastructure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this “manually” would represent a hefty sequence of operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve wBTC on exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap wBTC to USDC on mainnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve USDC on bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge USDC from mainnet to optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve USDC on Aave/Optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit USDC on Aave/Optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurray! Here’s for the application layer working its magic! But I’d like to focus on another even more critical dimension here - the curation dimension of Jumper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumper auto-detected the tokens I had in my wallet as soon as I connected, allowing me to find my wBTC quickly. It found two potential bridges and “recommended” one by placing it first (because it has the best returns). It found the respective token contracts and protocol I needed. It also provided me with an interface to execute all this without worrying if I was about to send my tokens to a scammer — that might not seem much to you or me, but to a normie, that is close to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from that example, let’s take a minute to settle the definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure layer: the base layer&lt;/strong&gt;, which can include blockchains (Ethereum), but also pieces of infrastructure that are built upon at the next layer (Li.Fi&amp;gt;Jumper scenario).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo; Application layer: the end-user layer&lt;/strong&gt;, where they actually interact with DeFi – these include all the protocols, frontends, and toolings (DeBank, DeFiSaver, Jumper, etc.) you are aware of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;raquo; Curation layer: the “guidance” layer&lt;/strong&gt;, helping users navigate the options available at the application layer. While it exists independently, its insights can and should be integrated into the application layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective is essentially a simplified version of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Decentralized-Finance-DeFi-Stack_fig4_340061422&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Schär&amp;rsquo;s DeFi Stack&lt;/a&gt; where his Settlement and Asset layers are merged into my Infrastructure layer, his Protocol+Application layer into my Application layer, and his Aggregation layer is broadened and rebranded into my Curation Layer:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Schar-defi-stack&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Curation layer champions, others than widely used tools with a curation/directory element such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://coingecko.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CoinGecko&lt;/a&gt; (helping users to validate token contract &amp;amp; protocols front end URLs), &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jumper.exchange/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Debank&lt;/a&gt; currently are websites/frameworks providing essential and verifiable insights on key verticals such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://l2beat.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Curation can include various endeavours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation&lt;/strong&gt;: Helping users verify the validity of information, such as CoinGecko acting as a source of truth for contract addresses or DeFillama for protocol frontend URLs, or Rabby various warnings helping users to realize if they are interacting with a spoofed version of a given protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation&lt;/strong&gt;: Curation is provided on top of the aggregation (“here is the best route”). This includes all DEXes and bridge aggregators (ParaSwap, CowSwap, Bungee, Jumper, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifiable Insights&lt;/strong&gt;: Information service providers like L2Beat, DeFiScan, or Bluechip enable users to access contextualized and verifiable information (onchain and against their respective framework) in their given vertical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-curation-layer-defis-achilles-heel&#34;&gt;The Curation Layer: DeFi’s Achilles’ Heel
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unconvinced about the urgent need for a better curation layer, I beg you to onboard your mom to DeFi, explain the basics of a wallet, send her some ETH, and watch her scratch her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna swap? Sure, we have 200 DEXes, 20 aggregators, aggregators of aggregators, and also those new bridge aggregators that now handle swap, ah and let’s not forget the intent-based protocols; by the way, do you know you can also indirectly swap by supplying a UNIv3 pool? So which one is it gonna be? Oh, you heard of Uniswap? Right, let’s try this. No, Mom, don’t click that first link on the search results; it’s not the real Uniswap. “But it’s written Uniswap”&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curation-is-the-missing-piece-to-mass-onboarding&#34;&gt;Curation is the missing piece to mass onboarding
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the biggest helper when onboarding people? It’s not Aave, Eigen, or the latest shiny chains like Bera or Abstract. It was simple, straightforward, and easy to use tools such as DeBank or Jumper.&lt;/strong&gt; On top of the utility, both also act as a mini curation layer: DeBank helps users know their positions and provides them with a safe and verified link to the protocol frontends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumper essentially made bridging something a normie can handle. Before Jumper, they needed to know about the various bridges available for a given route, safely find their website and not a phising copy of it sitting at the top of the associated query thanks to Google Ads; and if their token was just a little bit “exotic”, they also needed to be familiar with the contract address find, copy and paste flow. All of this was abstracted in a simple and safe-to-use UI, making DeFi newcomers immensely more comfortable with the multichain world. I’ve witnessed it firsthand with my trainees; there was a before and an after Jumper in how much they could accomplish independently without worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both DeBank and Jumper have curating components, it’s not their primary focus. If we want to broaden the base that can harness DeFi, &lt;strong&gt;we need to double down on curation&lt;/strong&gt;, with dedicated apps and services well integrated with the main gateways users already harness (wallets, portfolio trackers, aggregators, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-we-get-there&#34;&gt;How did we get there?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the lazy readers, I’ll give it straight: &lt;strong&gt;the DeFi staples failed us&lt;/strong&gt; – that is, the top protocols, institutions, and other well-funded actors of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about those prominent protocols like Aave, Uniswap, or Maker and their associated DAOs: have you ever seen them fund something remotely close to a DeFi public good?&lt;/strong&gt; Think about the big layer 2 or layer 1 foundations; do you see them entertaining such endeavours? The closest we got was maybe with Uniswap and the DeFi Education Fund, but it has limitations; its scope is mainly lobbying for regulations, and there remain &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.uniswap.org/t/demand-for-transparency-from-defi-education-fund/13299&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;unaddressed concerns about its funding and transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception here would be that DeFiLlama was initially funded by ex-Curve team members. However, it was done at a personal level, not in the name of Curve Finance: still, &lt;strong&gt;it is worthy of praise, as it shows genuine concern for the overall good of the space&lt;/strong&gt;, and not just Curve’s success — an endeavour usually direly lacking in DeFi, and the main driver behind our current predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this better, let me tell you a story. When the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt; was still an idea, we contacted various teams that we thought were value-aligned to offer them to donate to the Collective. Our core idea and pitch were that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFi Collective will help genuine DeFi thrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are a top protocol, you benefit from having a strong ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, even if you do not directly benefit from the existence and success of the Collective, you will benefit indirectly over a longer timeframe, and you might consider donating nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few resonated with the project, and we can’t thank them enough (they are listed on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the homepage&lt;/a&gt;). But for most, the conversations went essentially like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Hello, TokenBrice here, /insert_pitch/”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “Nice idea! So our protocol, where would it stand on the framework?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me, being honest: “Well, it depends; it could be stage 1 or 2, but even if that is, we will most likely not allocate funds to it at least early on, as we have to demonstrate the positive impact the Collective can have with smaller projects first.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “So there’s nothing in it for us?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Not directly, but you will benefit from having the DeFi ecosystem thriving: that means more resilient protocols and tokens for your protocol to integrate.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “Not interested.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it is just us, but it is not! Let’s look at the situation with the other curation-layer projects mentioned before. We have two oddities, DeFillama and L2beat, which, although they struggled initially, are now well-funded and often receive donations. Apart from that, it’s pretty much a nightmare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluechip initially explored a non-profit structure funded by donations but could not get sufficient funding, so it had to evolve into a for-profit venture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFiSafety is carried by only one chad, Rex, and had to introduce &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defisafety.com/pricing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;payments&lt;/a&gt;. Despite delivering high-quality and actionable reviews harnessed by many for years, it still barely stays afloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-curation-layer-projects-struggle-to-emerge&#34;&gt;New curation layer projects struggle to emerge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, the core issue is not so much about the funding of already successful and well-known curation layer projects but &lt;strong&gt;about smaller and newer projects not being able to source the funding they need to grow in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a project reaches an L2Beat / DeFillama size and awareness, supporting it can be seen as a “marketing cost” for adjacent projects. For instance, several L2s allocated a share of their token supply to L2Beat: it made economic sense for them, as it raised awareness of their L2. It achieved support for a public good simultaneously – a win-win! Thanks to their awareness and reach, these two curation layer projects also usually perform well on donation platforms such as Gitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cost-of-free-to-access-information&#34;&gt;The cost of free-to-access information
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is that these &lt;strong&gt;curation-layer services have serious costs&lt;/strong&gt;, costs they cannot recoup with their readers if they want to keep the information they produce maximally available – that is, free and open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give you insights on DeFiScan. Discounting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The months we spent researching and iterating on the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All DeFiCollective members who are seriously underpaid ($1500-2500/month for a half time) for their expertise and commitment (a.k.a. proper value-aligned Chads, I can’t thank them enough), are also supporting DeFiScan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many contributors, myself included, work closer to full-time for DeFiCollective/DeFiScan (for a half-time pay).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFiCollective covers all infrastructure and service costs incurred by DeFiScan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; the effective cost of a review in the $3000 (small immutable protocol) to $10 000 range (large codebase, mutable protocol), and potentially even more (hello Aave and your infinite codebase). Mind that each review is not only written by the initial submitter (who can be one of us or someone tied to the reviewed protocol) but also carefully discussed and reviewed by other team members. With 14 reviews already published, that’s essentially &lt;strong&gt;a “burn” of $91k already in about five months&lt;/strong&gt; of existence. &lt;strong&gt;If we account for the review in progress (total including the live ones = 35), this cost jumps to $227,500, or a ~$45,500 monthly burn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that the above is an estimation, as no one is paying for DeFiScan – not you, the readers/users, or the projects reviewed. For some perspective, let’s look at Bluechip since Ben agreed to share their pricing – what projects pay to get reviewed: $15k for a holistic evaluation and a $5k annual maintenance fee, starting after a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not writing this to beg for your money – we are figuring it out on our own, thanks to the unique situation of the DeFiCollective, and exploring all other relevant options. This is a reminder that information (curation, in our case) has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-you-dear-reader-do-about-this&#34;&gt;What can you, dear reader, do about this?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I’d like to stress that the goal of this article, the message it carries, is not “donate to your curation layer services”. However, you are welcome to, and at our level, you already have. When we offered our community the opportunity to donate for the first anniversary of the DeFi Collective, you &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org/blog/first-anniversary-nft/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;jumped at the occasion&lt;/a&gt;. You contributed the maximum possible (10 ETH) in not even three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the message I would love to spread is more about &lt;strong&gt;1) the critical importance of the curation layer, 2) realizing the costs of the valuable information they provide, and 3) the need for you, me, and essentially everyone to be much more proactive in advocating for its funding.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty clear that big DAOs and other well-funded institutions are not too eager to fund this, so it is up to us to help them see the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thanks to the unique situation at the DeFi Collective, we’re not worried about our short/mid-term survival; however, I think it’s a necessity for the long-term survival of DeFi to see DeFiSafety, Bluechip, and other projects yet to emerge and thrive. We are, of course, all three chatting to one another already and contemplating a “DeFi Information Service Provider Alliance” (name is a work in progress), in which we would love to see more significant projects like DeFiLlama and L2Beat as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read my plea and heard my call, the next step is simple: &lt;strong&gt;go to the DAOs you are active on and ask them what they are doing to support the space beyond their immediate benefits.&lt;/strong&gt; The current situation, with its seriously undersized curation layer, has severe consequences that should be obvious to all: &lt;strong&gt;newcomers are getting butchered&lt;/strong&gt;, rugged, scammed, etc. As a result, our whole industry looks like a circus from the outside. &lt;strong&gt;DeFi can only go mainstream once the average new user is reasonably safe&lt;/strong&gt;; that is currently not the case. Moreover, curation tools are also a big ask from institutional clients actively seeking such resources: &lt;strong&gt;an enhanced curation layer means we will be better at attracting and retaining both individuals and institutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go nudge public and well-known whales and other well-funded institutions to do more. Protocols of the size of Aave, Maker, Uniswap, Eigen, and more have a responsibility to support the broader ecosystem. Since they are currently barely/not doing it, &lt;strong&gt;it’s our job to remind them and advocate in that direction&lt;/strong&gt;, as that’s the beauty of DeFi: if they fail to do it because they see no immediate benefits for them, I’m convinced that they will suffer long-term and face real costs because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/0-lending-protocol-renaissance-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we’ve seen a flurry of novel and exciting lending protocols come to market, such as Morpho, DYAD, Fluid, or Tapioca; even more are expected in the coming months, such as Liquity V2 (Bold) or Euler V2. All are innovative, in the arena, trying things to the point that I wonder if we’re not experiencing a lending protocol renaissance after a few years of rehashing the same concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this article, I’d like to give you a tour of the interesting ideas I’ve seen being explored — we’ll go through some of the protocols mentioned above and, for each, focus on understanding their main innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collateralized-debt-position-cdp-protocols-vs-money-market&#34;&gt;Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocols vs Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, starting with a primer on the differences between CDP protocols (e.g., Maker or Liquity) and money markets (e.g., Aave or Morpho). It will come in handy as we will discuss both in this article and even finish with a project merging the two models into one protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDP (ex: Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Market (ex: Aave)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borrower Interest Rate&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Predictable, can even be fixed or initiation fee only&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volatile, entirely dependent on pool usage&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral accepted&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually limited options, cannot mix collateral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various collateral: a given position can mix several collaterals at once&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assets that can be borrowed&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the protocol stablecoin (DAI on Marker, LUSD on Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse – any asset enabled as a borrowable asset&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral re-hypothecation&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral are deposited in a pool and thus potentially re-lent to other users&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol core challenge&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stabilizing the stablecoin outputted &amp; securing enough liquidity on it&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attracting sufficient borrowable assets (USDC, ETH) to fulfill borrowing demand&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol main risk&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ stablecoin death spiral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ all borrowable assets are drained&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols stand out for their ability to facilitate cheaper borrowing costs, thereby stimulating more borrowing-side demand, a challenging feat to achieve. This is due to the unique feature of CDPs, where the user directly contracts debt against the protocol, eliminating the need to source and pay an external stablecoin depositor demanding a competitive interest rate, as is the case with a money market like Aave. The primary challenge with CDPs lies in the stability and liquidity of the stablecoin that is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money markets tend to be more flexible. Thanks to their structure, they allow users to mix and match collateral and can quickly onboard new ones. Yet, they tend to require more maintenance, as collateral parameters must be constantly adjusted to reflect the realities of the market. This creates quite the load for governance, as seen on Aave, where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://boardroom.io/aave/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;over a thousand proposals&lt;/a&gt; were already processed in four and a half years: approximately 22 per month. It works, but it seems overengineered; surely there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dyad-flirting-with-the-endogenous-collateral-taboo&#34;&gt;DYAD: Flirting with the endogenous collateral taboo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyad is a CDP protocol that implements several novel ideas, such as delivering free borrowing to its users, who must own an NFT to partake (Note). It also serves as the protocol&amp;rsquo;s base coordination layer. I invite you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyad.gitbook.io/dyad-docs-v2/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the documentation&lt;/a&gt; to become more familiar with it. Let’s zoom in on Dyad’s novel approach to handling a key topic for CDP protocols: overcollateralization.&lt;/p&gt;

To quickly tell, ask yourself this question: if the stablecoin fails, does the collateral also fail? If yes, your collateral is endogenous (ex: my beloved &amp;amp; defunct &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage-based stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;); if not, it’s exogenous (ex: ETH for Liquity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins harnessing endogenous or no collateral can scale quickly, as seen with ESD, Basis Cash, or Terra/UST. However, they can and usually do explode even faster. For this reason, harnessing endogenous collateral is considered a risky practice – worthy of an instant Red Flag / F on the stablecoin rating agency &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bluechip.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bluechip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/1-endogenous-collateral-bluechip.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to focus on today regarding Dyad is its utility token, KEROSENE, which is a mechanism for allocating the right to mint against existing surplus collateral in the system. By default, the system&amp;rsquo;s minimal collateralization ratio is 150%. However, KEROSENE holders can deposit it into their Notes to reduce their exogenous collateral ratio to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, KEROSENE is not technically an endogenous collateral but a mechanism to price and enable users to harness the protocol&amp;rsquo;s exogenous over-collateralization. KEROSENE’s utility gives it a “deterministic value” corresponding to its utility while deposited into a Note. Since KEROSENE is mostly farmed by supplying liquidity on DYAD, it could entertain an interesting flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/2-dyad-defillama.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;2-dyad-defillama&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the year, the protocol has seen gentle and steady growth, although still limited. The rollout is progressive: the base functionalities are live (Note, DYAD minting, LP incentives, KEROSENE utility), yet much more is coming: sDYAD, momentum (a mechanism to better align protocol participants), a lending market, etc. It’s worth following for any stablecoin enjoyer such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-v2--the-base-rate-of-defi&#34;&gt;Liquity v2 – The base rate of DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity’s LUSD remains one of the most successful genuinely decentralized stablecoins on the mainnet, so when v2 was announced, it gathered a lot of attention. After researching a novel approach harnessing a reserve model, the team pivoted back to a CDP protocol, growing from learning the first iteration. V2 is expected to be released by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to focus on one, in particular, on interest rate management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate management is crucial for all lending protocols, even CDP protocols. The rate can be easily defined based on the market utilization rate in money markets. For CDP protocols, replicating a similar approach is impossible, and other venues must be explored; several were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance-defined (ex: Maker / DAI): while this approach provides flexibility, it generates uncertainty for borrowers and challenges in governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithmic (ex: Liquity / LUSD): no governance is always better, when possible; however, it doesn’t come without shortcomings either. In the case of Liquity, the set initiation fee proved inflexible, which led to the protocol adjusting to a higher interest rate environment with redemptions and, thus, through a lowering of the overall LUSD supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v2, the protocol switches to an interest rate model (no more initiation fee), which should already provide more agility. What’s more interesting is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/liquity-v2-why-user-set-interest-rates&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how this interest rate is decided: directly by the users&lt;/a&gt;. The team introduces another protocol-level game with straightforward parameters: redemptions will be processed based on the interest rate paid by the user, from lowest to highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, users who choose a very low interest will put themselves first in line for redemptions, while those who pick the highest interest will be maximally protected. To make it easy for any user to partake, interest rate delegation will be possible, with various delegates delivering different mandates expected at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the protocol to rapidly adjust to all kinds of market environments, from low interest rates to high, avoiding the long redemption phases as seen in v1 while remaining immutable and delivering greater predictability to borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/3-bold-stability.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3-bold-stability&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the protocol gains adoption, the average interest rate observed could even inform beyond Liquity v2 itself, as it will correspond to a base rate borrowers are willing to pay on a risk-minimized and immutable protocol. Riskier protocols will have to offer a lower interest rate to attract borrowers. The v2 packs many more interesting innovations. To get up to speed, I recommend checking out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/bjnpck/status/1772227278606389496&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bojan’s thread of threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tapioca--cdp-x-money-market-convergence&#34;&gt;Tapioca – CDP x Money Market Convergence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapioca was launched just a few weeks ago and is still being progressively released, as some protocol components still need to be made live. In today’s highlight, I’d like to focus on two main items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of the CDP and Money Market model with Tapioca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The innovative token lock model harnessed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in. For more context about Tapioca, as often, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.tapioca.xyz/tapioca&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convergence-of-cdp-and-money-market&#34;&gt;Convergence of CDP and Money Market
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols face a challenge: they must deliver competitive yield on the stablecoin they output to drive demand. Liquity v2 will redirect most of the fees collected, thanks to the interest rate, to BOLD stakers, Maker has the DSR / sDAI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, another way to ensure stablecoin minters can access competitive yields is to build a money market on top of the stablecoin: that’s precisely what Tapioca is doing. Indeed, Tapioca is essentially a double protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the CDP—branded “Big Bang,” where users can mint USDO against selected collateral: gas tokens and LSDs. The collateral selection is purposely restrictive, as tokens accepted here directly affect USDO backing. Borrowers pay an interest rate and, depending on USDO’s peg situation, potentially an initiation fee of up to 1% (if underpeg). It enables users to loop-leverage their ETH / LSD exposure or simply harness their ETH / LSD as collateral to borrow some USDO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the money market — branded “Singularity,” which provides isolated markets where users can supply various types of collateral to borrow USDO, supplied by borrowers on the CDP side. This creates a native yield for USDO holders that is decorrelated from the CDP side, as well as offering an elegant approach to handle all types of collateral:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship resistant majors ⇒ CDP collateral =backing USDO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivatives / more risky tokens ⇒ Singularity = yield to USDO holders without compromising USDO’s backing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual structure allows Tapioca to host various collateral, with appropriate risk-mitigation measures for each. Since singularity harnesses isolated markets, the risk for each collateral onboarded there is isolated, and it can be further managed with its parametrization (LTV, interest rate, and liquidation bonus) and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twaml-an-innovative-token-locking-model&#34;&gt;twAML: an innovative token-locking model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After following and commenting on the DEX evolutions, starting with veCRV and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-vs-velo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the improvements we observed with Velodrome (veNFT)&lt;/a&gt;, I anticipated seeing token lock models harnessed on lending protocols too. It has been, but only in a primitive manner, with gauge-based emissions &amp;amp; governance token locking to allocate them, such as seen on Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca finally delivers with an exciting approach harnessing a new type of token locking (twAML), both for their governance token TAP and for the suppliers of the money market, to secure the supply side and thus drive more borrowing demand. Hence, after Velodrome improved the veCRV model and delivered the first credible improvement over veCRV, we might see its third iteration come to fruition. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td colspan=&#34;4&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Locking Model Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veNFT (ex: veVELO)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;twAML (ex: twTAP)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locked Position Transferable&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;TKN &amp;lt;&gt; veTKN ratio&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solely dependent on time duration, one veTKN per TKN if 4-year lock&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depends on twAML – the average lock duration of other lockers: if equal/above, then one veTKN per TKN&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veTKN &amp;lt;&gt; TKN Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, linear over time (ex, after 2 years of lock, only 0.5 veTKN per TKN)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Interest Accrued &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquidation Profit Shares&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Creation Fees&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Mint Fee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main innovation lies in the flexibility and additional game theory layer this model implements. Instead of a linear veTKN to TKN correspondence, depending on the time locked and maxing at four years, like with veCRV and veAERO, twAML looks at other lockers&amp;rsquo; average lock time (magnitude weighted). In practice, achieving a 1:1 TKN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;veTKN correspondence no longer requires a four-year lock but simply to lock for as much / longer than the existing locks. Thus, the lock time will rapidly increase during the first epoch, ramping up from the 4-week maximum initially set up until it finds an equilibrium point and potentially starts to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/4-twTAP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;4-twTAP&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released for the first time with dynamic adjusting, the twAML was met with excessive degeneracy and quickly ramped up over four years. Thus, the team has returned to work and switched the adjustment to epoch-based. The new iteration is expected in the coming weeks, another development worth monitoring for stablecoin and lock tokens enjoyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca is quite the beefy protocol, two years in the work. I’ve barely scratched the surface there, as there are many other components worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s natively omnichain harnessing Layer 0&amp;rsquo;s omnichain fungible token standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapioca, like Liquity, will be one of the few CDP protocols redirecting fees generated from stablecoin minting to its token holders through the twTAP model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewards for USDO lockers are distributed in oTAP, an option token connected to the twAML logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol is keen on accruing Protocol-Owned Liquidity, both for TAP and USDO, which will enable it to lower its liquidity maintenance costs and potentially turn it into a profitable endeavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cover more protocols, but this article is already beefy, so I’ll keep it there for today. There are many exciting developments for lending protocols worth discussing, such as the growth of isolated markets with protocols like Morpho or Silo. All of this and more leads me to believe that after years of Aave &amp;amp; Maker dominating the lending protocol landscape, we might see some challengers rising to a similar size, if not overtaking them in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be watching, and so should you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Gray for the cover image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Subtles nuances with great consequences: a cross analysis of Curve and Velodrome" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to address Velodrome/Aerodrome, a genuine success story in DeFi. I’ve covered DEXes extensively on this blog, especially Curve: this article will compare the two models and explain how Velodrome improved on the veCRV template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me start with a disclaimer: there are two core components to a DEX that everyone needs to be aware of to understand what follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The liquidity structures it provides (x*y=k, stableswap, CL, stableswap-NG, curve V2, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentives model, which for a DEX is synonymous with its tokenomics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on the latter, the core of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s innovation. This post assumes basic familiarity with Curve’s veCRV tokenomics; if not, I urge you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/fr/crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read my previous writing about it&lt;/a&gt;, posted three years ago but still helpful to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vecrvvevelo-fees-collection--distribution&#34;&gt;A/ veCRV/veVELO Fees Collection &amp;amp; Distribution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fee collection and redistribution are the lifelines of a decentralized exchange. Here, simplicity is usually good, as the DEX segment leader Uniswap is still operating under an extremely simple yet brutally efficient model, where 100% of the collected money goes to the liquidity providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of its CRV token in August 2020, Curve explored an alternative path, where 50% of the fees collected on a given pair go to liquidity providers and the remaining 50% to the “DAO” (admin fees), meaning the veCRV holders. Curve introduced the concept of “liquidity gauges,” where locked token holders (veCRV) can direct emissions to be received by liquidity providers, creating an incentive baseline independent of the volume processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome launched two years later, at the end of May 2022, and explored yet another split, inspired by a previous project iterating on the Curve model: Solidly. Here, &lt;strong&gt;LPs get no exposure to the fees collected on the pairs they provide liquidity for and are fully incentivized by token emissions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core difference between veCRV and veVELO lies in how they handle the fees collected at the DEX/DAO level, where we observe differences in the amount of fees collected and their distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the nuances of this topic: they are key to understanding the pros and cons of each mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a1-amount-of-fees-distributed-velo--2-x-curve&#34;&gt;A.1/ Amount of fees distributed: VELO = 2 x Curve
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve and Velodrome operate under the same base logic: every week, a given amount of CRV/VELO tokens are emitted and distributed to liquidity providers. Each pool has an associated gauge for which veCRV/veVELO holders can vote, and the weekly budget allocation follows the proportion of the “gauge vote”: if a gauge receives 1% of the total veCRV/veVELO vote, 1% of all the emissions produced that week will be directed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are essentially the main cost for the DEX: the price paid to attract and retain liquidity. What matters then is what comes on the other side of the balance sheet – the revenues: in our case, it’s the fees collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, revenues stem from the “admin fees” of each pool, which are usually set at 50%. This means the fees collected on a given pool are split 50/50 between the LP and the DAO/veCRV holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/curve-revenues.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-revenues&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward: liquidity providers get no exposure to the fees collected on the pool they supply; they are incentivized through $VELO emissions only, meaning that the DAO/veVELO holders get 100% of the fees generated on the DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this core difference already has a massive impact, the following one is even more meaningful as it pertains to how those fees are distributed to veCRV/veVELO holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a2-model-for-the-distribution-of-fees-a-fairer-and-more-efficient-approach&#34;&gt;A.2/ Model for the distribution of fees: a fairer and more efficient approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve harnesses a model that could be described as &lt;strong&gt;a fee mutualization system&lt;/strong&gt;: the fees veCRV holders receive depend only on the amount of veCRV they control. Without getting too technical, those fees are collected in the various tokens involved in the pool (such as USDC/USDT/DAI for the 3pool), and every week, harvested, swapped for 3pool LP token, and then made available for claiming to veCRV holders – as you can see, this means somewhat of an infrastructure to operate, the cost of which scale with the number of pools on the Curve DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Velodrome provides a superior model on all dimensions, as it achieves better DEX/LP/token holder alignment without any infrastructure required. Let’s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome connects gauge-voting activity with fee distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, the amount of veVELO one controls matters, but even more important is which pool one votes for since the &lt;strong&gt;voters are exposed to the fees collected on the pairs they vote for only.&lt;/strong&gt; They collect the fees as such (i.e., a voter of the ETH/USDC pool gets ETH and USDC), meaning the infrastructure required is much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome ties fee distribution to the gauge-voting activity: veVELO holders receive the fees collected on the pool they vote ONLY, paid as such every week. It enables the better alignment of veVELO holders with the best interest of Velodrome as a DEX compared to Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple twist creates an interesting voting flywheel. High-volume pairs collect lots of fees, meaning high incentives for voters. This leads to many votes, which direct sensible emissions to the pair, attracting more liquidity providers, enabling more volume processing, etc., until an equilibrium point is reached. This means that high-volume pairs sustain themselves without bribes or a benevolent profit-minimizer whale-voter needed, which is not the case with Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a3-what-it-means-in-practice&#34;&gt;A.3/ What it means in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough with the explainer; let’s illustrate by considering the case of a veCRV/veVELO voter, who decided to vote for a pair processing minimal volume (the situation is common).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veCRV holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Curve as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives the same amount of 3CRV as a more Curve-aligned voter with an equivalent veCRV bag trying to direct incentives to maximize volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Velodrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veVELO holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Velodrome as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives a marginal amount of fees since the pool he is voting for is processing a marginal volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is the same in reverse for voting on a high-volume pool that would be of interest to the DEX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Curve, this DEX-aligned voter will receive the same amount of 3CRV as anyone holding the same bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Velodrome, this DEX-aligned voter will be well rewarded, as he will be a majority voter on a high-volume pair: an ideal situation to maximize fees earned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both sides, bribes are paid to voters and can lead to situations where votes are directed to pools that are not optimal in terms of volume processed. However, on Curve, there is no penalty for doing so. On Velodrome, bribers of such pools compete with high-volume pools offering attractive APR to voters, with or without bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing, from another angle: on Curve, the cost of bribes depends only on the value of CRV emissions. On Velodrome, the baseline price a project must pay to gather votes depends on the total bribes + fees collected on other pools. This means that high-volume pools push the cost of bribes upward, entertaining yet another flywheel in the flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the above means understanding the core difference between the Curve and Velodrome models. However, to get the full picture, more elements must be considered. Let’s discuss the LP boost now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;b-lp-boosts--its-impact-on-the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;B/ LP boosts &amp;amp; its impact on the ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LP boost, as it is called, is a Curve-specific feature. Many protocols forking the veCRV tokenomics, such as Balancer with its veBAL, also use it. It enables veCRV holders to earn more CRV rewards on their LP, factoring in several elements, including the size of their veCRV bag and the size of their various LPs. Thus, with appropriate veCRV ownership, an LP can get an “LP Boost” of up to 2.5x compared to the base emission rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b1-lp-boost-explained&#34;&gt;B.1/ LP Boost explained
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize the boost obtained, up to 2.5x maximal, one must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own as much veCRV as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have LP positions in as many pools as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a proportionate/balanced amount of TVL in those various pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simply put, LP Boost is a rugged game from the get-go&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not designed to benefit individual veCRV holders over their LP but to attract meta-protocol, such as Convex, who can achieve 1+2+3 consistently. &lt;strong&gt;The growth of Convex is not a success story; it is by design (Curve’s design)&lt;/strong&gt;. If it were not for Convex, another similar protocol would own most of the veCRV supply. We observed similar patterns with other protocols that adopted LP Boost: Balancer has Aura. Convex and Aura control &amp;gt; 50% of the veCRV/veBAL supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome and Aerodrome completely avoid the possibility of a new protocol to gobble up the supply by not having any boosting mechanism. As we’ve seen with Curve, Convex emerged and captured most of the supply; now, all LPs are earning with a boost, and none are benefiting from any disproportionate amount of CRV. The system has converged to everyone earning about the same effective boost, or in Velodrome/Aerodrome’s case, no boost since the future outcome would’ve been LPs earning the same effective boost. The other fact remains that since Convex has a majority of CRV locked, they control the future governance of CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b2-consequences-of-lp-boost&#34;&gt;B.2/ Consequences of LP Boost
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the LP-Boost calls for a Convex-like layer on top of the DEX; there is no avoiding it. At this point, some could think: &amp;ldquo;So you have a protocol gobbling most of your emissions and locking them forever; what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s simply inefficient design since those meta-layers provide features that could be delivered less convoluted at the base level (by the DEX itself) and without the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve needs Convex and the bribe marketplace: Votium, Warden, and Hidden Hands. But also the auto-compounder/vote delegation manager: Airforce Union, Concentrator, etc. You end up with dozens of protocols taking some fees here and there to deliver something that Velodrome manages to pack in natively. This makes the experience more complex for the users, who must know about these dozens of protocols and their subtleties to make the most of Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember how, while discussing the fee distribution, we mentioned that Curve required a much more dense infrastructure to operate? Well, imagine the mess that veCRV+LP Boost is in the backend. There is a reason why both Curve and Balancer are taking ages to ship on a new L2, and often with partial functionality (such as no LP boost, surprise surprise.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;seamlessly-expanding-beyond-what-curve-offers&#34;&gt;Seamlessly expanding beyond what Curve offers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, the bribe marketplace is built-in: projects can post their bribes directly on the Velodrome frontend, and voters can check available bribes and vote in the same place. New features keep being delivered and added to the same interface used by all participants: LPs, projects, and tokenholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;velodrome-relays&#34;&gt;Velodrome Relays
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go from quality-of-life / gas-saving upgrades, such as the “auto-max-lock”, saving lockers for those who wish to remain max-locked to maximize their gauge-voting power the hassle of doing it manually, to much more extensive features, like Relay, a veVELO position management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/relay.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;velodrome-relay&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tool catering to projects using Velodrome to grow liquidity on their pairs. It enables them to set up their voting and bribing strategy and implement it automatically: no need to submit weekly transactions anymore. Relay has another benefit, since currently, the strategy available is a veVELO-maxi one, compounding all fees &amp;amp; bribes collected into VELO and relocking it to maximize voting power: it creates a sizeable VELO sink, directly indexed on the fees distributed by the exchange. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1762908204894445834&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Almost 1/5 of all veVELO are already there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Relay feature matures, more strategies will be available to its users, including some that compound all the fees and bribes earned into veVELO but, for instance, make them claimable in ETH or USDC. It will prove very convenient for veVELO holders that are not looking to support a project in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;venft-tokenized-locked-positions&#34;&gt;veNFT: Tokenized locked positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velodrome has other neat innovations packed in, such as the still under-appreciated veNFT: with Curve, veCRV is non-transferable, making their management painful. Velodrome can achieve the same alignment but enables transferability: veVELO positions are represented by a veNFT that can be transferred. There is no way of redeeming a given veNFT for the underlying VELO tokens apart from waiting for the lock to expire. However, it eases the management of such a position by enabling its transfer. There is also &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decode.market/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an OTC market for veVELO veNFTs&lt;/a&gt;, where holders can sell their position to interested buyers at a fluctuating discount compared to the value of underlying VELO tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-deep-understanding-of-the-nature-of-the-game&#34;&gt;A deep understanding of the nature of the game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges like Curve or Velodrome are a particular product type in the DeFi landscape. In regular business terms, &lt;strong&gt;they could be described as B2B2C: Business to Business to Consumer&lt;/strong&gt;. They are B2B because their first customers are other projects – the various protocols looking for liquidity. If they successfully service this market, the projects they onboard to their DEX will do the B2C work for them, as their liquidity pools present opportunities to their respective token holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I feel like Curve utterly failed. With its pyramid of solutions nested on top of one another, Curve is particularly unfriendly to onboard for projects. They wanna bribe? All right, decide between veCRV or vlCVX bribes on Bribe.crv, Votium, Warden, or StakeDAO. Do they want to manage their own CRV? Fine, just pick between veCRV, aCRV, cvxCRV, sdCRV, vlCVX, uCRV, etc. While this myriad of options might ravish Curve-enthusiasts, it turns, in my perspective, into a negative quality for the B2B side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the experience with Velodrome is seamless: one place where everything happens, one option for each – without needing to compare between half a dozen cryptic and sometimes misleading alternatives. Coupled with the previous characteristics of the veCRV games discussed before, especially the LP Boost, it makes the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/farewell-glc/#the-case-of-the-crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve ecosystem particularly unfriendly to new entrants&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;who would want to enter a race rigged in favor of the first entrants three years after it began&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/tour-de-op.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tour-de-op&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Velodrome BD efforts are remarkable; the team is broadly available to help onboard new projects, and several programs are designed to make the experience as simple and compelling for new entrants, regrouped under the “Tour de OP” umbrella, which includes a bribe matching program, lock bonuses and vote boosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;PARTING WORDS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might have seen, both Velodrome &amp;amp; Aerodrome have attracted much attention lately, thanks to their token seeing positive momentum: I think it&amp;rsquo;s well deserved. The release of Slipstream, Velodrome’s implementation of Concentrated Liquidity, will increase the volume processed per unit of TVL, unlocking the flywheel&amp;rsquo;s next growth phase. Aerodrome, Velodrome’s fork on the Base network, has seen spectacular growth since it launched six months ago, further demonstrating the model&amp;rsquo;s viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the Velodrome team is starting to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-metadex-48e4af1ef9a4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;refer to Velo as a &amp;ldquo;MetaDEX&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at Velodrome becoming the base liquidity hub not just of Optimism but for the whole Superchain: all chains built on the OP stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell, but Velodrome is already a resounding success on Optimism, so managing a cross-chain DEX properly would be a game changer. This is especially true considering how much Curve &amp;amp; Balancer has failed there—not because they did not try, but simply because their convoluted infrastructure with LP boost makes cross-chain deployment painful (Hello AuraFinance distributing AURA on chains where&amp;hellip; there is no liquidity for $AURA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I’m addressing the DEX part of the product suite here, which is the complete product for Velodrome but not for Curve, which now has crvUSD and Llamalend. Still, even with crvUSD included, Aerodrome is now collecting and redistributing more fees than Curve, all of this while being present on one chain only vs 13 for Curve. While Curve-DEX has been sub-par for a while, the team has repeatedly proven innovative and able to bounce back. crvUSD revenues have already flipped those of Curve-DEX, and who knows what Llamalend could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game on: let’s wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Farewell to the GHO Liquidity Committee and reflections on the rise of DeFi newspeak</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/farewell-glc/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/farewell-glc/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve resigned from the GHO Liquidity Committee and would like, in this blog post, to share more context on its adventures and the learning we can draw from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/verifySig/35543&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Signer removal transaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those whose first reaction will be “ain’t ready all of that,” here is a recap of the main shortcoming I see in the committee that led to my decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s operating model is inefficient and prevents a coherent vision from emerging and being delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s scope of responsibilities is unclear, leading to a passive attitude (towards governance mishaps) assumed by most members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee mainly comprises governance professionals who lack any serious expertise in the topic at play – liquidity management. It results in inefficient operations, conflicts of interest because of their numerous other commitments, and subpar use of the Committee’s resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance is always a challenge. Indeed, it can seem insane to give power to random people on the internet, and it often is. There is a built-in democratic assumption in governance operations – although most governances are purely plutocratic – that severely hinders any serious structuration that would enable delivering upon commonly agreed goals. The GHO Liquidity Committee was appointed by the Aave governance precisely because it recognized – in a flash of lucidity – its incompetence and ineptitude in directional liquidity management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I’ll tell you what’s even crazier: giving power to people that the crowds perceive as “experts” on a topic. It’s all a show: the most recognized and mediatic expert of a given field is never the one actually the most informed on the topic. I, for one, would know quite a bit on the matter, with my own field of specialization — liquidity management, shaping, and incentivization — a topic prone to public perception manipulation more than any other because of the financial stakes inherently associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-case-of-the-crv-wars&#34;&gt;The case of the CRV Wars
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s illustrate: regarding liquidity, the word on the street is that Curve is the best model, and all pros and experts use Curve, right? &lt;strong&gt;It’s so good that over the last round (62), projects are spending $1 to receive $0.7 of incentives to their pools&lt;/strong&gt;: an instant donation of 30% of the amount they spend on bribes to veCRV/vlCVX holders. It means that if projects which bribed would have allocated the same amount to direct liquidity mining instead, they would have delivered 30% more $ to their LPs and thus attracted more liquidity for the same cost, all of which without assuming the price risk associated with CRV fluctuations for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s happening there? Quite a few things, and it’s not the main course on today’s menu, just the appetizer, so I’ll go over this quickly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most projects have no one internally competent with liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;, so they often do random wastes like these. Many prominent DeFi projects recognized for the liquidity games are big spenders but not exactly savvy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curve Wars have been a meme for a while&lt;/strong&gt;: there have been no genuine new entrants in these wars for ages – simply because it’s not worth it financially for most players, especially those without ties to the Curve ecosystem. Moreover, the liquidity structures available on Curve (stableswap and V2) are suboptimal compared to Uniswap or Maverick for many very common types of DeFi tokens – LSDs, LRTs, loosely pegged stablecoins, and liquid wrappers. You can confidently mark any protocol outputting a token of this type building liquidity primarily on Curve as inapt in liquidity management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you are left with are &lt;strong&gt;“insider protocols,”&lt;/strong&gt; teams building on top of the Curve ecosystem who usually own sizeable veCRV/vlCVX positions, allowing them to recoup a large share of their bribes (1. Own veCRV/vlCVX ⇒ 2. Post a bribe ⇒ 3. Vote on the pool you just bribed ⇒ 4. Collect and repeat next round). This tactic manipulates public perception into thinking that real money is being spent on these Curve wars. Some of these now insiders are originally external protocols, such as Inverse or Alchemix, which decided to kiss the llama ring for the better and the worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take my word for it; simply look at the top spenders: Frax, Convex, Alchemix, CLever (Aladin), Prisma, Conic, Inverse, etc. &lt;strong&gt;To make it easy to visualize, here are the top spenders of the last round, ranked by amount spent, with the insider protocols highlighted in red&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with Curve, llamas already hate me; I just wanted to highlight the example of Curve, “the king of liquidity,” being a poorly efficient venue to build and sustain liquidity. Curve, “maker or breaker of stablecoins,” as the DEX with arguably subpar liquidity structures for most stablecoin pools: &lt;strong&gt;Newspeak arrived in DeFi, and public perception/words used are often entirely at odds with the onchain observable reality&lt;/strong&gt;. Sadly, a similar pattern has been observed with the GHO Liquidity Committee, today&amp;rsquo;s topic, so let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-case-of-the-gho-liquidity-committee&#34;&gt;The case of the GHO Liquidity Committee
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GHO Liquidity Committee is a prime example of expertise misplacement&lt;/strong&gt;, as it was composed of an unhealthy mix of professionals “DeFi politicians” (more on this below), people with low expertise and vested interest in a given DEX, and people close to the Aave’s DAO / ex Aave team but devoid of any expertise on the topic of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It led to a waste of resources, baseless struggles, and heavily misinformed decisions. At the end of the day, the &lt;strong&gt;GLC is like a big bag of cash everyone was trying to pull from to direct to protocol they have an interest in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive in: what were its limitations, and what anyone interested in governance, whether committee-based or not, can learn from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;operating-model-of-the-glc&#34;&gt;Operating model of the GLC
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first months, the GLC operated erratically, sometimes leading several initiatives that were at odds with each other and needed a more coherent vision. It was simply a bunch of degens with a large amount of GHO in a multisig &lt;strong&gt;spraying and praying&lt;/strong&gt;. The pinnacle was reached when bribes were allocated to a pool whose liquidity shape was detrimental to the repegging efforts, which, luckily for the Committee, ended out of range before the emissions began, enabling its prompt termination: a net burn of GHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eventually elected head of the committee and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/TokenBrice/status/1719328410479059227?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;assumed a temporary and objective-based dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;. It enabled the committee to stop allocating resources on liquidity support that were doing a disservice to the cause of repegging GHO and &lt;strong&gt;focus the energy, resources, and efforts where it actually mattered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the story also raised eyebrows and attracted media attention (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/28/aaves-gho-stablecoin-nears-elusive-dollar-peg/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/benevolent-dictator-succeeds-in-bringing-aave-s-stablecoin-gho-near-parity-with-usd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiant&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) as it highlighted the failure of governance by itself – at least from the perspective of said media. &lt;strong&gt;During my two mandates, two targets were set: the first was missed by a few basis points (after an increase of ~200 bps), and the second was missed by a few days&lt;/strong&gt;. My targets were ambitious, especially considering that they relied as much on deliverables external to the liquidity committee (interest rate management, single-sided staking for GHO, etc.). After two terms, I let go of the leading role early in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ When governance elects a committee to handle a specific task, it acknowledges its inefficiency on the matter. &lt;strong&gt;Such committees should not shy away from appointing a leadership, as ownership and responsibility can be very healthy,&lt;/strong&gt; especially in “decentralized” governances where the eminences are often gray, and thus ownership and responsibility often lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scope-of-the-glc&#34;&gt;Scope of the GLC
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLC inherited several “governance debts”: decisions made by the governance that prove absolutely indefensible in the current state of affairs and operations. It failed even to find the will to challenge them and instead decided to enforce them despite the warning of a couple of committee members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Mobilizing the CRV of the committee as sdCRV, a subpar option at the technical level, as it requires weekly voting of the committee (no vote carry-over), has low liquidity, and strips the committee of its due CRV gauge voting power unless it owns veSDT / benefits from a veSDT boost delegation, all of that in a lovely ethical mess, as it strengthens ties with a protocol/team that operates with many questionable practices and several committee members are veSDT holders and in proximity with the said team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-professionalism-means-in-defi-newspeak&#34;&gt;What “professionalism” means in DeFi newspeak
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in groups such as the GHO Liquidity Committee are expected to be “professionals” — you, dear readers, and I would understand by that: master of their topic, accurate, always trying to serve the committee&amp;rsquo;s purpose, and available for their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re misplaced, as in DeFi newspeak, “professionalism” has an entirely different meaning; it’s actually the opposite, as DeFi “professional” profiles tend to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make no waves, and avoid anything perceived as “political”, even if that means associating with scammers: you cannot put business partners in a tough spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence truths that are hard to swallow but would be of public interest to enable the community to learn from previous mistakes. For instance, &lt;strong&gt;the failure of the developers of GHO to anticipate the depeg is never discussed&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it had been expected by many – myself included — up to one year before GHO’s launch. The interest rate model and the absence of a GHO single staking option at the launch were both apparent lacks that any competent stablecoin developer should have anticipated and resolved &lt;strong&gt;before launch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harness structures such as the GLC to promote the protocol they have vested interests in by all means possible, even if that means arriving at situations that, if described honestly, would qualify as conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate, by their onchain initiatives and the communication they share in private groups, an approximate, if not missing, understanding of the topic of their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⇒ Participants in governance should learn how to place their trust better. Thanks to their existing platforms, the most publicly visible figures are usually selected when committees are elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presence in this committee was an oddity that emerged out of necessity, as governance knew that a deep understanding of liquidity shaping, especially Maverick, was needed to give the GLC the best chances of success. Many actual experts hanging around governance forums and Discords remain powerless despite their knowledge and good intentions simply because they are not well-known figures in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rise-of-defi-politicians-and-its-consequences&#34;&gt;The rise of DeFi politicians and its consequences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance is a theater. Anyone involved in DeFi knows that, but even myself was surprised to realize the extent of the scenarization of governance interactions. Just like IRL politics, where we have professional politicians devoid of expertise about the topics they are handling, we’re observing the same phenomenon in DeFi, where a caste of politicians is assuming an increasing responsibility over various DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such profiles specialize in governance-related operations and operate exactly like the IRL PR specialists: their primary care is about public perception and how to manipulate it to achieve their purpose&lt;/strong&gt; (usually obtaining the allocation of a sizeable budget from the DAO to their governance structure). Governance discussion is not happening publicly on the forum — the forum is just a stage. The actual discussions are happening backstage: in calls, IRL meetings, and DMs. Discussions on the forum are avoided as much as possible, especially if they are anticipated to be controversial. The forum is simply here to record previously and privately discussed matters: look at the conversations on most proposals: they look so fake that, at this point, one could suspect bots are talking to one another, which once again reminds me of IRL politics. It happened to me several times that such a profile contacted me as I was typing an answer to their governance post, trying to avoid any form of public discourse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⇒ Confirmed DeFi politicians (= those who earn their money mostly/only through governance-related activities) should simply be banned from participating in any structure having even a remote power – as they are the bane of decentralization, the devil in Prada of DeFi. The professionalization of governance is synonymous with its capture and thus centralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1710510768469237827?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hayden puts it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;governance stands at the bottom of the tier list in terms of decentralization and thus should be a solution of last resort.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only is it inefficient, but it’s also simply too prone to be manipulated, and the probability of it happening increases with the power and resources the governance manages. &lt;strong&gt;Once a given governance has grown enough, its corruption is simply unavoidable&lt;/strong&gt;, at least under the current dominant plutocratic governance model: 1 token = 1 vote, hello stone age of governance we’ve been seemingly stuck at for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, allow me one last analogy with IRL politics since we’ve established that similar actors participate in DeFi’s governance. Governance professionals love to dismiss ideas because they deem them “too political.” It enables them to appear as reasonable, non-aligned figures. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;non-alignment does not exist: every decision is political&lt;/strong&gt;. Those who say otherwise usually tend to be positioned at the “extreme-center” end of the spectrum: a brutal profit maximalist alignment wrapped in a costume of gentle neutrality, aka the DeFi equivalent of an Emmanuel Macron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to committees appointed by governance, I am unlikely to participate in any other after this one – unless its scope is clearly defined and it&amp;rsquo;s given the means to challenge governance&amp;rsquo;s suboptimal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing my next step: contributing to a DeFi mastermind geared to support trustless and unstoppable DeFi: The DeFi Collective</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-collective/</link>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-collective/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/defi-collective/twitter_banner.png" alt="Featured image of post Introducing my next step: contributing to a DeFi mastermind geared to support trustless and unstoppable DeFi: The DeFi Collective" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Proudly introducting The DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, financial systems have been mismanaged by states, corrupted by entrenched private interests, and unable to deliver an equitable, fair, and transparent baseline to enable unfettered value exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over five years ago, I discovered the (back then) nascent decentralized finance ecosystem and was promptly convinced it embodies a credible attempt to deliver a neutral value exchange layer, freed from the influence of states and able to resist the corruption attempts of private actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Ethereum network provides a neutral ledger, enabling users to transact in a purely peer-to-peer fashion. Its ability to support smart contracts allows for the creation of various protocols for more advanced use cases — some of which can approach the network&amp;rsquo;s resilience level, such as Uniswap, a financial primitive providing infrastructure for the permissionless exchange of any token that will operate as long as the Ethereum network synchronizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I progressively became more engaged and committed to upholding and delivering on this vision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2018, I started to write and share about DeFi on various mediums, and eventually launched this blog a couple of years later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In late 2019, with friends, we launched &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/defi_fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi France&lt;/a&gt; to nurture a supportive environment to broaden adoption and involvement in DeFi amongst the French-speaking communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2020, I started to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@DeFiFrance/featured&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;host live shows in French&lt;/a&gt; to document the most relevant DeFi protocols and deepen the users’ comprehension of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, in 2022, I joined the Liquity team, to help grow the adoption of LUSD, a critical piece of infrastructure in my perspective, as it remains the most resilient stablecoin available to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proudly-introducing-the-defi-collective&#34;&gt;Proudly introducing The DeFi Collective
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to introduce my latest commitment to help the DeFi ecosystem deliver on its initial promises: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DeFiCollective_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;. The DeFi Collective attempts to solve a structural imbalance that could ultimately lead DeFi to fail to deliver on its core values. DeFi suffers from an inherent tension between delivering on its base values and the concessions some think are needed for growth and adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widely adopted protocols are rarely the most resilient, and we at the Collective believe it stems from an incentive misalignment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams who tightly control their protocol (usually through multisigs) and harness aggressive tokenomics models tend to have more firepower to attract capital and promote themselves than those who value security and sturdiness above all else. We picture the Collective as a critical resource in reverting this imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nonprofit-association-to-support-the-sturdiest-defi-protocols&#34;&gt;A nonprofit association to support the sturdiest DeFi protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? It’s straightforward; you’ll see that the &lt;strong&gt;DeFi Collective delivers a competitive edge, allocated only to the highest-quality DeFi protocols.&lt;/strong&gt; Protocols that ensure open, transparent, and resilient public infrastructures will receive the support of the DeFi Collective, free of charge and without conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeFi Collective is a Swiss nonprofit association incorporated in Zug, bound by its status to use its resources to support the most resilient and relevant DeFi protocols. What does this entail? The Collective will clarify and publish its “protocol guidelines” shortly after launch: any protocol that matches them is eligible for its support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what kind of support are we talking about? About all the critical expertise a protocol needs to harness to grow and thrive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness and education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrations and networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal &amp;amp; self-policing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Collective is &lt;strong&gt;a group of experts that cannot be hired; instead, it self-appoints on protocols that match its demanding guidelines.&lt;/strong&gt; Embodied by the ants, The Collective intends to demonstrate that social coordination is paramount. Together, ants will build an ever-growing colony, acting as an organic mesh network nurturing an ecosystem where trustless DeFi can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ants-like-and-harness-liquidity-driving-tokens&#34;&gt;Ants like and harness liquidity-driving tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deliver on its vision, The Collective received support from top-notch teams that align with it, including Liquity, Maverick, CatInaBox, Diva, DYAD, Zero &amp;amp; Retro. &lt;strong&gt;It enables the Collective to be self-sustainable from day one, and able to direct and sustain over $25M of assets in liquidity pools of relevant DEXes across various layers,&lt;/strong&gt; including mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM &amp;amp; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Collective controls sizable liquidity-driving positions, including veVELO, vlLIQ, vlAURA, veRAM, veZERO, veRETRO &amp;amp; more, and manages treasuries on all the networks mentioned above, to support the liquidity of relevant tokens through liquidity-driving votes and liquidity-providing activities. The Collective adheres to extremely risk-averse treasury management practices intended to preserve and grow its capital in a manner that is synergistic with its goals and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-liquidity-management&#34;&gt;Beyond Liquidity Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management and support is a critical area of expertise for the Collective that I will champion, along with governance-related activities to increase the adoption of the tokens from the supported protocols across the broader DeFi ecosystem. However, the DeFi Collective is an adventure much bigger than myself, and I am blessed with the support of two equally critical founding board members – Nils Bundi and Florian Prantl, who deliver on their expertise in their respective areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-bundi-6246b998/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nils Bundis&lt;/a&gt; is a DeFi protocol architect and developer with a background in financial engineering. As an experienced DeFi builder, he knows the challenges of building “truly decentralized” protocols. Apart from the technical depth, Nils will also support the Collective with his expertise in the operational requirements, ensuring secure and trusted DeFi services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/floowp_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Floria Prantl&lt;/a&gt; is a lawyer and policy specialist with a background in advising DeFi and CeFi projects, navigating the legal and regulatory pitfalls in setting up and expanding their services. He also brings valuable experience advocating with authorities for progressive and balanced regulations. At the Collective, he particularly lends his expertise to operational compliance, offering guidance to supported protocols and contributing to the Collective&amp;rsquo;s self-policing, networking, and other vital initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their skills and knowledge will help the Collective to conduct research, establish and promote self-policing guidelines, and entertain any other relevant activities deemed necessary to deliver on &lt;strong&gt;its vision of supporting the existing resilient and DeFi-aligned protocols and foster an ecosystem where protocol builders have increased incentives to walk the path of sturdiness, immutability, and resilience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-streamlined-infrastructure-kept-in-check&#34;&gt;A streamlined infrastructure, kept in check
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All board members and contributors to the Collective are capped to a commitment accounting for at max 50% of their working hours. This policy was designed to keep the structure in check and avoid situations where the preservation/growth of the structure is given more priority than achieving its end goals, which is often seen in public institutions and associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors have agreed to compensation well below the market rate for their efforts. Boardmembers are not compensated for their activity. This enables the Collective to minimize its starting expenses and aggressively compounds its earnings to grow its onchain treasuries, giving it more means to deliver on its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DeFi Collective is now my main focus and commitment&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that I will sadly no longer be able to contribute directly to Liquity as a team member. It was not an easy decision to make. Still, it was necessary to enable me to keep focusing on my areas of expertise (liquidity management and governance) and keep growing them. As one of the most resilient lending infrastructures available, the Liquity protocol matches the Collective guidelines and will be part of the supported protocols amongst several others to be introduced shortly. The Collective will thus be able to support Liquity’s growth and expansion with liquidity-management-related activities and help LUSD get more broadly supported across DeFi protocols and L2.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/stablecoin-marauder-map/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/stablecoin-marauder-map-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Maurauder&#39;s Map of Decentralized Stablecoins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild new stablecoins are constantly appearing, and with the multiplication of chains, layers, and viable stablecoin models the trend is not stopping anytime soon. &lt;strong&gt;Navigating the stablecoin landscape is turning into a critical skill for DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized stablecoin models are easier to evaluate, decentralized stablecoins harness various complex mechanisms, making it harder to compare their data face to face. Yet, dozens of relevant new decentralized stablecoins are appearing yearly, and I don’t expect the trend to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, this article intends to provide a marauder map to help navigate the landscape of decentralized stablecoin designs. Before combing through the innovations for decentralized stablecoins, allow one more minute to the context: why do we care so much about (decentralized) stablecoins in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;size-matters&#34;&gt;Size matters
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins are cryptocurrency’s top product-market fit by a wide margin&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi is cool, right? We love it on this blog. Yet size-wise, there are about 3 times more value locked in stablecoins than in DeFi protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the total TVL in DeFi is around $38B for $124B of stablecoins circulating, serviced mainly by centralized options: USDT makes 66% of the total, and USDC is another 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dive in! As we consider the various designs harnessed to deliver decentralized stablecoins, I’ll illustrate the mechanisms discussed using examples from live projects: picture this article as recipe book meets marauder map on the topic of decentralized stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-decentralized-stablecoin&#34;&gt;HOW TO BUILD A DECENTRALIZED STABLECOIN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a virtually infinite range of designs that can be harnessed to output decentralized stablecoins; however, they all rely on two essential core needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Price Stabilization&lt;/strong&gt; | Finding an effective way to stabilize the stablecoin price without too much compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; | The active management of the liquidity on the stablecoin to maximize its effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both themes address the same need: ensuring that the stablecoin can be traded at peg whatever the circumstances, they operate on different time frames. Stabilization mechanisms are built so that stablecoins tend to their peg over the mid/long time-frames. Liquidity strategies are here to ensure even sizable amounts of the stablecoin can be bought/sold as close as possible to the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are two prerequisites for a stablecoin design to be relevant and have a chance at gathering traction. Faults on those two dimensions jeopardize the whole design, so let’s look at the leading price stabilization mechanisms harnessed and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;price-stabilization-mechanisms&#34;&gt;PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISMS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with sizable demand, decentralized stablecoins can depeg - that is, divert from the peg, usually $1, either upwards or downwards. While similar, the two depegs stem from vastly different design challenges. Let’s start with the most common, the depeg when a $ stable is worth less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;underpegging-illustrated-with-gho&#34;&gt;Underpegging illustrated with GHO
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually happens when the stablecoin is mainly used for leverage and lacks significant direct use cases – &lt;strong&gt;a current prime example is Aave’s GHO, trading around $0.97&lt;/strong&gt;. GHO is one of the cheapest stablecoins to borrow (1.5% max APY), creating a lot of initial demand for it. Yet, there is not much to do with GHO directly apart from providing liquidity. Thus, many borrowers swap their GHO for something else, for instance, DAI, to harness the 5% yield from the DSR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the AaveDAO has been slow to take action to support GHO. Despite the stablecoin being live since mid-July, there are still very few incentives directed to growing GHO’s liquidity, and they are poorly allocated as most of them focus on stableswap pools where GHO is overweight because of its price. Since these pools are 80% composed of GHO, they provide little adequate liquidity at the current price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/gho-balancer-pool.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gho-balancer-pool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the only pressure for GHO to repeg comes from the existing borrowers who could consider repaying their debt with a ~3% discount if they could borrow and swap GHO around $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GHO will need attractive earning options directly available in GHO to approach the peg again, such as liquidity-providing options. Still, a GHO-based staking module with revenue sharing would fit the task nicely. Overall, we need more GHO-sinks: mechanisms resulting in GHO being minted and held as such for long periods. Right now, it seems like governance is pushing forward increased support for GHO’s liquidity incentives and a potential GHO PSM (Peg Stability Module): more on this design is below while we address Maker/DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was launched a few weeks ago, most of GHO’s current challenges come from its young age, coupled with a lack of preparation for the launch on the DAO side. The DAO is improving in that regard, with many propositions pushed forward to address the situation, including establishing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a liquidity committee for GHO&lt;/a&gt; I should contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overpegging-illustrated-with-lusd&#34;&gt;Overpegging illustrated with LUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; utilizes a unique mechanism called Redemptions to maintain its price stability. In Liquity, users deposit their ETH as collateral to borrow and mint stablecoins (LUSD). The key innovation lies in the redemption mechanism, which enables users to redeem LUSD for the underlying collateral (ETH) at a fixed ratio, even if the market price of ETH drops significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism incentivizes users to stabilize the price of LUSD by redeeming it when ETH prices are low, thereby reducing the circulating supply of LUSD and supporting its peg to the USD. It provides &lt;strong&gt;immediate and immutable access to LUSD’s collateral to LUSD holders&lt;/strong&gt; without the need for liquidity on a decentralized exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemptions provide an additional layer of guarantee to LUSD holders but add complexity on the borrowing side, pushing borrowers to monitor and adjust their LTV against other protocol users and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral redemptions provide the most direct access to the underlying backing of a stablecoin. Centralized stablecoins like USDC or USDT use a similar, although permissioned, mechanism to enable redeemability to USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD traded at a premium for most of its existence, even though the situation has improved recently. Indeed, several factors contributed to enhancing the liquidity and the peg pressure: the success of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chickenbonds.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chicken Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, advanced liquidity strategies on novel DEXes like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mav.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, or the accumulation of LUSD by DAOs and treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The why of the premium still needs to be pinpointed precisely. One of the likely main factors is that &lt;strong&gt;LUSD is servicing a unique niche&lt;/strong&gt;, the resilience-maximized stablecoin, where there is usually more demand (people wanting to hold LUSD) than offer (ETH holders borrowing LUSD and selling it). &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency#:~:text=LUSD%20is%20a%20stablecoin%20fully,also%20comes%20with%20scalability%20challenges.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This topic was covered in depth last year on Liquity’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While underpegging is usually more concerning, overpegging can have real consequences, too, as it can make effective borrowing costs less predictable for the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD’s overpeg stems from mostly psychological mechanisms: the worst case of sustained overpegging was observed during movements of market panic, especially when a prominent centralized stablecoin is perceived at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, thanks to its resilience, LUSD is seen as a &lt;strong&gt;safe haven stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. A remarkable feat, but it comes with a price: crowds rush to LUSD when other stablecoins are at fault, such as when USDC depegged 10% following the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank. LUSD saw an incredible trading volume that day, with sizeable purchases above $1.03, $1.04, and $1.05 as the market panicked. Amid the panic, some users are willing to pay a high price to fly to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dai-and-the-psm-solving-overpegging-for-a-price&#34;&gt;DAI and the PSM: solving overpegging, for a price
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its early days, before the Mutli Collateral Dai update, DAI had similar challenges to LUSD: it tended to overpeg. With the update, Maker introduced the Peg Stability Module (PSM) to manage the price stability of its stablecoin DAI. The PSM acts as a buffer between the market and the DAI ecosystem. It allows users to swap stable assets like USDC for DAI at a fixed exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the exchange rate in response to market dynamics, MakerDAO can influence the supply of DAI in the market and keep its price close to the USD peg. It helped MakerDAO resolve the DAI problem over pegging, observed before the PSM. Still, it came with a cost: an accumulation of USDC and other centralized stablecoins as DAI’s collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fraxs-amo-algorithmic-market-operations-scale-liquidity-and-risk-to-infinity&#34;&gt;FRAX&amp;rsquo;s AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations): scale liquidity and risk to infinity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRAX is a decentralized stablecoin that utilizes Algorithmic Market Operations to maintain its peg. FRAX employs an adaptive mechanism that adjusts its collateralization ratio based on market conditions. When the FRAX price trades above its peg, the system mints new FRAX and buys back collateral, increasing the stability of the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the FRAX price falls below the peg, it reduces the collateralization ratio to encourage users to mint FRAX, which helps restore the peg. AMOs come with additional risks, mainly depending on the usage of the assets minted without collateral: the riskier their exposure, the bigger the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal risks of such a design manifest when an issue with one of the services harnessed (usually money markets or DEX) arises. Say 10M FRAX are minted by the AMO and deposited into a money market to be borrowed by users. Now, the money market suffers an issue with one of its collateral and gets drained: there are now 10M more FRAX in open circulation with 0 collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigating this requires very active management of the AMOs - by humans, through a multisig, which is not ideal from a security perspective, as AMOs can mint FRAX at will with no backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crvusd-pegkeeper-a-better-psm&#34;&gt;crvUSD pegKeeper: a better PSM?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the peg-stability of crvUSD, Curve explored a path similar to the PSM, but slightly improved. Indeed, here, the need for users’ input is removed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker PSM, it’s still user-driven: when overpeg, users supply USDC as collateral to Maker PSM and mint DAI, helping to push its price back. If DAI was to underpeg, users could similarly buy DAI (below $1) to redeem it for 1 USDC, helping to restore its price to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crvUSD works similarly at a high level (if crvUSD&amp;gt;$1 =&amp;gt; mint, if crvusd&amp;lt;$1 =&amp;gt; burn) but does not require any input: the system stabilizes itself thanks to its pegKeepers contract. These special contracts can mint non-collateralized crvUSD under certain conditions and for specific use cases only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 pegKeepers, each plugged into a different pool of crvUSD paired against a redeemable centralized stablecoin: USDC. USDT, USDP &amp;amp; TUSD. When crvUSD is overpeg, they can mint crvUSD to trade into the associated pool, helping to push crvUSD price back to $1. When crvUSD is underpeg, the pegKeeper can repurchase crvUSD on their associated pool (using centralized stable balances accumulated during overpeg) and burn it to push crvUSD’s price back to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, pegKeepers accumulate a crvUSD debt to the protocol when the stablecoin is overpegged, to be ideally resorbed once crvUSD is underpeg. The key here lies in the balance, ensuring that the spread between the supply of crvUSD (incl. Pegkeeper debt) and the borrowed supply does not grow too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pegKeepers still pose a decent threat to the protocol, just like the FRAX’s AMO or Maker’s PSM, the risk seems more mitigated there. Yet, crvUSD is still quite a young stablecoin, and only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-management&#34;&gt;LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management, even just for a stablecoin, could be a good topic for a thesis. It’s one of the most misunderstood topics across the space. I wanted you, dear reader, to be aware of its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;liquidity-management-as-a-non-topic&#34;&gt;Liquidity management as a non-topic
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read this blog, you’ve likely already internalized that &lt;strong&gt;liquidity strategies are the heart of the storm of the stablecoin wars.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet, many teams have yet to attain this realization. They picture it as something of low criticality that the DAO will handle later, which is incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DAOs are not the best structure to manage liquidity, they tend to harness suboptimal solutions, overpay, and simply need more velocity to match the fast pace of the liquidity games. No surprise here; we’ve already established ages ago that &lt;strong&gt;DAOs/governance are a good fit for strategical (long-term) orientations but inapt at mid/short term (tactics) management,&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to the example of MakerDAO (where, despite the absurdity of it, MKR holders are still voting on the vault’s interest rate, a purely operational parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution would be for the DAO to &lt;strong&gt;appoint a liquidity committee&lt;/strong&gt; - a small team of liquidity specialists provided with a budget they can mobilize autonomously. The committee could be hired for a set term, while the DAO retains the right not to renew the committee or even revoke it similarly to other service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to look at the main stablecoin projects run by DAOs and see which one has a committee yet. As far as I know, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only Aave is finally considering it for GHO&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the increased agility and operational capacity provided by the committee, it also enables the DAO to be more structured and forward-planning in its liquidity approach, allowing it to explore partnerships and collaboration with more relevant actors, such as supporting an innovative DEX from day one at launch, instead of the many months required to explain the relevancy of the innovation to the DAO’s stakeholders and have a budget being voted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;competence-is-scarce&#34;&gt;Competence is scarce
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard truth about liquidity management is that competence is extremely scarce. This could explain why the topic needs to be better understood and rarely prioritized at the project&amp;rsquo;s design stage or later in the governance discussions. An apt liquidity manager must have an accurate understanding of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base liquidity structure model, x*y=k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom liquidity structures like stableswap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic concentrated liquidity, UNIv3 style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap liquidity management layer (Bunni, Merkl, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CL liquidity manager model (Gamma, Arrakis, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veCRV tokenomics &amp;amp; ecosystem // veBAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote marketplaces and bribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced concentrated liquidity, Maverick style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick incentives model (Boosted Pool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick tokenomics (veMAV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEX Aggregator landscape and pathing logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scope of tools, services, and protocols used for liquidity management is increasing exponentially, and very few actors are following closely&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s frequent to observe absurd spreads between the liquidity spending of two similar projects, with sometimes spreads of several orders of magnitude of difference in terms of $ invested / results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-attract-piles-of-ethlsds-onchain&#34;&gt;How to attract piles of ETH&amp;amp;LSDs onchain?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we focused on stablecoins harnessing the CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) model, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, where users must deposit collateral to contract debt directly against the protocol (every borrower on a CDP protocol mints their “own” debt). It’s an elegant design that enables the protocol to implement various devices to absorb the volatility of the collateral, thus maximizing the price inertia of the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-limits-of-cdp-based-stablecoin&#34;&gt;The limits of CDP-based stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet, CDP-based stablecoins come with one main downside: the over-collateralization requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to dampen the volatility of collateral such as ETH without any margin of error. For instance, on Liquity, the minimum collateralization ratio tolerated is 110%, yet the average ratio observed on the protocol is 226.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcollateralization is the central limit of the CDP model, and is hard to overcome. Indeed, lowering the collateralization requirement could attract more borrowers, increasing the risk scope of the stablecoin outputted. Thus, scaling a CDP-based stablecoin is a tough job. There are other relevant ideas to attract more borrowers, such as diversifying the collateral offering, as shown below. But here again, it comes with increased risks on the stablecoin, as seen with DAI, which observed a sizeable collateral degradation over the last years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, many projects are exploring approaches that could result in a stablecoin with fewer compromises than DAI while achieving a similar scale. Let’s consider a few directions currently explored to scale decentralized stablecoin further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;expand-the-collateral--chain-offering-liquity-forks&#34;&gt;Expand the collateral &amp;amp; chain offering: Liquity forks
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 is the year of the Liquity fork: many protocols were launched this year, harnessing a model more or less similar to Liquity, with some twists. These include Gravita, Prisma, Lybra, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;gravita&#34;&gt;Gravita
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gravita&lt;/a&gt;, probably the closest to the base Liquity model. Here, the focus is put on making the protocol more attractive to borrowers, with several welcome additions, including the possibility of borrowing using liquid staked ETH like stETH or rETH as collateral or the protocol being made available on L2 like Arbitrum. Of course, it’s a game of balance here, as the rule specified above still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conditions enforced on the borrowers dictate the guarantees provided to stablecoin holders&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;prisma-finance&#34;&gt;Prisma Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://prismafinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Prisma Finance&lt;/a&gt; is also exploring a similar approach, another Liquity fork enabling the usage of ETH-LSD as collateral, built by a team close to the Curve/Llama ecosystem. Components of the veTokenomics are also envisioned on the fee-sharing/governance token PRISMA, but they still need to be made live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lybra-finance&#34;&gt;Lybra Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lybra.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lybra&lt;/a&gt;, experimented with a lock/escrow model on their governance token LBR. While it seems to have initially worked nicely to attract a sizeable amount of capital, the challenge with such tactics is to sustain them over time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;dyad&#34;&gt;DYAD
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyadstable.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DYAD&lt;/a&gt;. This one is technically not a Liquity-fork per se, but more of a Liquity-inspired protocol, especially regarding the price stabilization mechanism of their stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge they are trying to solve is onboarding new collateral on a live CDP protocol without expanding the risk scope of the base protocol more than it needs to. To do so, DYAD introduces a &amp;ldquo;Social Licensing Layer,&amp;rdquo; essentially the governance layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it looks like none of the governance we&amp;rsquo;re used to: here, there is no governance token, so that it won&amp;rsquo;t be your usual plutocracy. Instead, governance power lies directly within the dNFT needed to use the protocol:  each dNFT gets to control a single &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; for each proposed collateral type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can change the position of this switch at any time from off to on or on to off and back again, as often as they want. A given collateral can comprise part of DYAD&amp;rsquo;s collateral basket if it maintains a 2/3 supermajority of &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; switches. The only way to increase your governance power is to control more dNFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYAD also gets bonus points for preserving immutability as much as possible. While the protocol can be changed since it can onboard new collateral, the whole governance layer is immutable. DYAD is not fully live yet, only dNFTs are, but I&amp;rsquo;m eager to see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping with the majors here: LSDfi was all the rage a few months ago, and we’ve seen many protocols providing options to leverage ETH-LSD launching lately. While this sub-market is likely already crowded, there’s room for a CDP-based model delivering a stablecoin slightly less resilient than LUSD but with additional features. The question is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-gentle-with-your-borrowers-llamacrvusd&#34;&gt;Be gentle with your borrowers: LLAMA/crvUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to create a sink for ETH/ETH-LSD: make the conditions more attractive to borrowers / soften the liquidation penalties. Indeed, one of the main innovations behind crvUSD lies with the liquidation model that differs vastly from other services providing leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLAMA (Lending Liquidating AMM Algorithm) replaces the usual liquidations with “soft liquidations”, where underwater borrowers are rebalanced across “bands,” each representing a different price segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides a sizeable protection against liquidations stemming from brutal but unsustained market movements. Instead of the sudden liquidations we’ve been used to, LLAMA&amp;rsquo;s soft liquidations are more gradual, as the collateral is progressively adjusted in proportion to its market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-it-rain-dai-saving-rate--variants&#34;&gt;Make it rain: Dai Saving Rate &amp;amp; variants
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why even bother improving your design when there are more direct paths forward? MakerDAO pioneered this idea of offering a “risk-free” yield to stablecoin holders to drive the demand: the DAI Saving Rate, currently at 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustaining it proves very costly for the DAO, which is increasingly pushed towards riskier but more lucrative collateral to keep afloat. A sizeable share of the collateral are now real-world assets (RWA) managed by custodians, some of which are slow or even fail to meet their yield or reporting obligations or simply sub-optimal (MakerDAO is currently earning 3% on its USDC while &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-raises-usdc-interest-rate-to-5/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;retail can score 5% with Circle&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, surprise, surprise: incentives work, at least at first. Thus, this brutal, low effort, and poorly efficient design over the long term is now spreading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirror.xyz/0xa486d3a7679D56D545dd5d357469Dd5ed4259340/1qSAAQtVdNCW_xn9cObEjwrQzFpwEshNrm0sjX0nkG8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Raft launched a similar concept at 6%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frax is also working on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-2xx-sfrax-governance-proposal/2585&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sFRAX / Frax Saving Rate targeting 5%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/maker-dsr-impact.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;maker-dsr-impact&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, time will tell for the impact of such design over the long run. The way I see it, these protocols are &lt;strong&gt;depleting most of their revenues to pay for acquisition on an ongoing basis&lt;/strong&gt; — they will lose most of the users acquired with DSR the minute they stop. They would have burned a massive amount of money to sustain the charade, money that could have been spent on strategic assets providing life-long incentives to the liquidity providers of their stablecoin, for instance. &lt;strong&gt;This design is a great tactic but one of the most short-sighted strategies I have ever seen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-shift-to-reserve-backed-stablecoin&#34;&gt;A shift to reserve-backed stablecoin?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shift is brewing! While CDP-based models, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, are flourishing, &lt;strong&gt;reserve-backed stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; are also getting increasingly considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as we highlighted above, there is an inherent tension in purely borrow–based / CDP stablecoins. To put it simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling a decentralized lending-based stablecoin requires attracting and retraining a sizeable amount of ETH / ETH-LSDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the more permissive the protocol is to borrowers, the less desirable the stablecoin its output will become.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of a CDP-based stablecoin depends entirely on its users&amp;rsquo; actions. Under the reserve model, the protocol directly manages the reserve and minting of stablecoins instead of individual positions. Thus, reserve-based models seem to offer a credible answer to CDP-based stable shortcomings, enabling the stablecoin supply to potentially scale more thanks to the native protocol reserve providing increased price inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s summarize this article by examining two prime examples of implementing a reserve-backed stablecoin model. I’ll keep it short and digestible and add resources for diving further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fx-leverage-with-no-fundind-costs--90-volatility-dampened-eth&#34;&gt;f(x): leverage with no fundind costs &amp;amp; 90% volatility dampened ETH
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;F(x) is a fascinating protocol freshly released! It’s a dual product, enabling stETH depositors to expose themselves to two types of assets in the proportion they desire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xETH: a “high-volatility leveraged ETH”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fETH: a “low-volatility floating stablecoin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to a CDP protocol, users deposit ETH (or stETH) to mint fETH or xETH. However, unlike Liquity/Maker/Other CDP, the user does not manage its position (a Trove). Instead, the protocol directly manages the stETH reserve. A redemption feature enables holders of fETH or xETH to reclaim the underlying stETH. However, how much they redeem depends on the system&amp;rsquo;s state, most notably its Net Asset Value: the overall value of stETH in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/protocolfx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;protocolfx&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched just a few weeks ago, the protocol is still in its early stages with about 1300 ETH of TVL, and the liquidity on fETH is still being worked on. A third token, FXN, the governance token of the protocol, is also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition of both xETH and fETH is relevant to me and should be met with demand once the protocol is more mature. In my view, along with crvUSD, it’s one of the most exciting releases we got stablecoin-wise this year: I’m just waiting for the right time to experiment-ape into xETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity-v2-protected-lsd-leveraging&#34;&gt;Liquity v2: protected LSD leveraging
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Liquity v2” (codename) is not live yet but has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zps__IMxtTs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduced by Robert Lauko at the last Stable Summit in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fETH, v2 will offer non-liquidatable leverage on ETH-LSD with no funding fee and even add downside protection. The novel, reserve-backed stablecoin the protocol will output is optimized for scaling. Its liquidity needs are also minimized since the protocol acts as a primary AMM for the stablecoin: users can mint and redeem the stablecoin for $1 of staked ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V2 is being built in public: if you’d like to learn more about it or even get involved, make sure to come by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/RCRp2CJR2S&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management is the nerve of the stablecoin wars: observe &amp;amp; analyze the strategies deployed by the projects you monitor – their effectiveness is one of the main drivers of the success of the underlying protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Follow the event surrounding GHO’s liquidity management on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave Governance Forum&lt;/a&gt; and try to articulate your thesis. If you can anticipate the repeg accurately, you get 3% of free profit waiting for your (GHO ~$0.97 to $1.00).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ BONUS-TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; GRAI, another stablecoin (Liquity fork), is currently trading at ~$0.985 with its redemption ceiling increasing over the next few weeks; a similar play can be considered there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSD-FI (protocols to leverage LSD) has been overcrowded over the last few months. Most protocols in the vertical are losing traction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the incentive structure of protocols like Gravita, Raft, or Lybra, and confront it with their growth metrics — try to evaluate the incentive structure that seems persistent versus the ones losing steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ~4 years of going autistic with the CDP-based model, it seems like the most savvy teams started to look another way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since Maverick is out, and a few days since the MAV token joined the fray. Yet, most of DeFi is still scratching its head regarding how Maverick delivers 2-3x the capital efficiency of its top competitor, Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the time was right for a deep dive into the innovations brought by the model and the new paradigm it fosters regarding liquidity management: &lt;strong&gt;liquidity shaping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-on-dex-more-like-tools-for-lp-to-express-themselves&#34;&gt;Innovations on DEX? More like tools for LP to express themselves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a decentralized exchange can innovate at two levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure&lt;/strong&gt;: the options offered to liquidity providers to design the supply activity that best matches their thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And/or &lt;strong&gt;the incentivization model&lt;/strong&gt;: the tools and modalities enabling DAOs &amp;amp; projects to incentivize customized or not liquidity structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most new DEX being released recycle an existing infrastructure and focus on innovating on only one dimension - usually the incentivization model - as seen recently with the wave of Solidly/Velodrome forks - &lt;strong&gt;[ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?](&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a few critical moments in the industry when a new DEX was released and provided &lt;strong&gt;critical innovation on both fronts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V1/V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; established a solid infrastructure for &lt;code&gt;x*y=k&lt;/code&gt; pools &amp;amp; basic incentivization model: 30 bps fees auto compounded &amp;amp; the possibility of having Liquidity Mining programs on the staked LP tokens (ERC20).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve&lt;/strong&gt; provided an innovative and efficient liquidity model for pegged assets (stableswap) while pioneering a ve/gauge-based model for liquidity provider incentivization introducing a revenue capture at the token level (admin fee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UniswapV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; delivered the tools to manage a more advanced liquidity structure harnessing concentrated liquidity efficiently and providing more flexibility fee-wise (1, 5, 30, 100 bps fees, not auto-compounded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally came &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/maverick-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which goes even further than UniswapV3 in the customization of the liquidity structure it provides, offers streamlined position management (native rebalancing) and an unprecedented level of control regarding incentivization options, marking the birth of a new paradigm: liquidity shaping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each core innovations &lt;strong&gt;enable more expressivity for LPs: they get access to increasingly refined and customized tools enabling even the most intricate thesis to find a proper medium to be expressed onchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, before diving into the depth of liquidity shaping, some pointers on Maverick are necessary. Indeed, to fully understand the impact of liquidity shaping on Maverick, you first need to master its liquidity structures and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-liquidity-structures&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S LIQUIDITY STRUCTURES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of Maverick&amp;rsquo;s critical innovations is its liquidity structures, enabling the exchange to reach an unprecedented level of capital efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick offers four options to LP that could be regrouped into two categories for simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static mode is similar to a UNIv3 liquidity providing across a custom range, with &lt;strong&gt;immensely more flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And three dynamic modes offer &lt;strong&gt;various flavors of rebalancing to LP&lt;/strong&gt; to optimize further their earning: left (follows price to the left), right (follows price to the right), and both (follows price both ways).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mavericks-static-mode-is-a-game-changer&#34;&gt;Why Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Static Mode is a game changer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many still have to understand how much of an improvement Maverick&amp;rsquo;s static mode is over UNIv3, so let us focus on it for a minute. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick table recapping the main difference to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Uniswap v3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Maverick Static Pools&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supply liquidity in an arbitrary custom range, even potentially only with one token&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Support an uneven liquidity distribution within that range&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports customized fees and width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 fees tiers, 1 width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Near-infinite fee/width tiers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports the creation of ERC-20-wrapped LP tokens to ease LP onboarding &amp;amp; incentivization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ (Boosted Pools)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the distribution of rewards (Liquidity Mining)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the weighted &amp;amp; customized distribution of rewards to LP (Liquidity Shaping)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like UniswapV3, Maverick supports supplying liquidity in &lt;strong&gt;an arbitrary custom range,&lt;/strong&gt; even potentially only with one token, for instance, an LP on ETH/USDC from $2000 to $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current price is below $2000 (at the time of writing: $1900), the LP will be supplied purely with ETH and progressively rebalances to USDC as the price moves upwards, ending entirely in USDC at $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about LPs that have an even more refined thesis? What about the LP that sees ETH in that range for a week but mainly in the $2150-2250 area? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice for him to be able to express this thesis through the liquidity structure he chooses? It is precisely what Maverick enables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot above, you see a distribution from $2000 to $2400 on the ETH/USDC pair; however, &lt;strong&gt;unlike Uniswap, which necessarily distributes liquidity evenly across the range, Maverick enables LPs to choose&lt;/strong&gt;. To better fit our LP thesis, most of the liquidity is concentrated over the three ticks covering the $2150-2250 price zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maximizing-the-expressivity-offered-to-lps&#34;&gt;Maximizing the expressivity offered to LPs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expressivity offered to LP on Maverick is virtually infinite. I expect to see some interesting use cases emerge soon, especially for the protocols that will harness Maverick from the get-go (&amp;ldquo;Maverick-native&amp;rdquo; protocols). For instance, y&lt;strong&gt;ou could envision Maverick as a price stabilization mechanism for a stablecoin or a pegged asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the stablecoin project controls some liquidity, it could supply it in very expressive ways in times of need to constraint the price range. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;buy wall&amp;rdquo; liquidity structure on LUSD: the whole liquidity of this LP is supplied on a single tick, the first one where LUSD is worth below 1.00 USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a current price &amp;gt;1.00 USDC, this LP is supplied 100% in USDC and acts like a buying reserve: if the price of LUSD falls, the LP will rebalance. Such positions are promising, as they can exert buy/sell pressure helping to better constrain peg assets within narrower ranges, which massively reduces the cost of their liquidity incentivization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-the-dynamic-modes&#34;&gt;What about the dynamic modes?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick dynamic modes offer a convenient and easy solution for LPs who maximize their exposure to market prices to maximize the volume processed. All three modes essentially harness the same structure but give different options to LP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price just one way (left or right) - there are tons of pairs where it makes a lot of sense, like wstETH/ETH (wstETH being &amp;ldquo;up-only&amp;rdquo; against ETH thanks to the staking yield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price both ways, a good match for LP looking to maximize adequate liquidity and fees collected at the expense of increased IL risk on the principal. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly suited for stable and pegged asset pairs, but not only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;Maverick delivers native rebalancing to its LP&lt;/strong&gt;, and here again, it goes above and beyond what preceded in terms of customization options. &amp;ldquo;Native&amp;rdquo; is the keyword here, meaning the rebalancing can be &lt;strong&gt;done cleverly and gas-efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. While this is not new by itself, here again, the devil lies in the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, LPs have no options: their liquidity is concentrated, but all LPs of a given pair are under the same regime. It eases the management, but kills the expressivity. With Uniswap, LPs can dynamically rebalance their position using third-party tools like Arrakis; it comes with sizable trust assumptions, potential fees, and hefty gas costs. It allows more expressivity but requires more active management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are some limits to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s liquidity rebalancing, based on a TWAP and with some delays to avoid manipulations, it remains a crucial tool to help LPs maximize the time effectively spent in range / in the current price tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-incentivization-model-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S INCENTIVIZATION MODEL: LIQUIDITY SHAPING
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the first fundamental innovation brought by Maverick - the unprecedented expressivity offered to LP in the design and management of their position - we can now explore Maverick&amp;rsquo;s second leg: its novel incentivization model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story here is both short and long. &lt;strong&gt;In short, Maverick provides the same level of customization at the incentivization layer as at the pool creation level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads us to a longer story, with examples to be more explicit. Replicating most existing liquidity structures and incentivization models on Maverick is possible. But what&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting are the new ones previously never tried because they were not technically feasible before Maverick: it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-contract-triggered-buysell-walls&#34;&gt;Dynamic contract-triggered buy/sell walls
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the example from earlier about the stablecoin project posting liquidity as a buying wall to constrain the price? &lt;strong&gt;The project does not even needs its liquidity to do it&lt;/strong&gt;, as the same process can be replicated with a boosted pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project creates a boosted pool where all the liquidity is distributed on one tick below the price like above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project supplies incentives to the boosted pool for the duration of its choice &amp;amp; apes will do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can be automated and triggered entirely through smart contracts, meaning another contract could dynamically manage the incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-cvxcrvcrv&#34;&gt;The case of cvxCRV/CRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s study another checkmate case, the one of cvxCRV. Indeed, the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool is the absolute worst offender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;a regular structure, absolutely sub-optimal for an asset trading in a constrained range like cvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; liquidity mining model where all LPs are paid equally&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to cvxCRV deposits, which make 75% of the pool, earning 75% of the rewards - while being close to useless liquidity-wise (as there are already too much cvxCRV in that pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-can-be-done-better&#34;&gt;So what can be done better?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the concentration could be finetuned much more at the liquidity structure level. cvxCRV is a &amp;ldquo;one-way asset&amp;rdquo;: you can wrap CRV to cvxCRV 1:1 through the Convex contracts, but converting cvxCRV to CRV is done on a DEX at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; This means cvxCRV has a price ceiling against CRV: in no world, cvxCRV could be worth &amp;gt;1 CRV, and the current price is around 0.95 CRV per cvxCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; The ideal structure for such a pool could be &lt;strong&gt;a concentration going from 1cvxCRV = 0.9 CRV to 1 cvxCRV = 0.99 CRV, offering vastly superior liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the incentivization layer, massive gains are to be made with a switch. Instead of paying all LPs equally while the pool is massively unbalanced, why not focus on those who bring the most value to the pool, aka the CRV component?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d go with two joint pools to best cover that pair incentivize-wise: &lt;strong&gt;first, a static LP over ten bins&lt;/strong&gt; centered around the current price - it provides room for the price to express itself with sufficient liquidity &amp;amp; this structure is already &amp;gt;100x more efficient than the existing Curve V2 pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; For the nail in the coffin, we can &lt;strong&gt;add a one-tick left-right pool one top to maximize liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of this example help you understand that if you take this pool to Maverick, the compounded effect of the superior liquidity structure with a vastly more efficient incentivization model leads to results from a different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently $54M TVL in Curve cvxCRV/CRV pool for a daily volume of around $300k daily (0.5% utilization). With a base incentive of 12% CRV, ~&lt;strong&gt;$6M of CRV tokens are expanded yearly to maintain this liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Maverick, a ~$500K  properly structured pool&lt;/strong&gt; ($250k static broad range + $250k left-right) &lt;strong&gt;would be sufficient to consistently process the $300k daily volume&lt;/strong&gt; with better prices than on Curve. Assuming the same incentivization intensity, &lt;strong&gt;it would cost $60k a year to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proto-liquidity-shaping-with-bunni&#34;&gt;Proto Liquidity Shaping with Bunni?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that, at this point, you get a better sense of why liquidity shaping is genuinely revolutionary, as it will allow another order-of-magnitude leap regarding the efficiency of both the liquidity structures and the incentivization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are earlier, less complete iterations on such a concept, provided by the liquidity manager built on top of UniswapV3 that allows incentivization on a customized range, for instance, rewards for LUSD/USDC LP, but only for the LUSD = 0.999 USDC to LUSD = 1.01 USDC range. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bunni.pro/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bunni&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those could be described as &amp;ldquo;proto liquidity shaping,&amp;rdquo; as they enable to force a specific price range but cannot apply different weights to each tick in that range: they are limited by the Uniswap V3 pool model that offers less flexibility than Maverick. In the end, both are quite complimentary as Bunni can be used to force a wide range, which can be further refined with a uneven static Maverick pool &amp;amp; finally maintained uber liquid at current price with a left-right on Maverick too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mav-token&#34;&gt;MAV TOKEN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clear perspectives on both the novel pool structure and incentivization model and their consequences, we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to add the last piece of a puzzle, one you&amp;rsquo;re likely more familiar with, but here too, there are key differences: the MAV token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released just a few weeks ago, the MAV token has been airdropped to early liquidity providers and protocol users. The initial airdrop is just &lt;strong&gt;the first of many&lt;/strong&gt;, and more are planned, for LPs, but also protocols harnessing Maverick or building on top of it. For more details on the intended distribution, check this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;As readers of this blog, I imagine you are extensively familiar with the veCRV model and its implications. If not, you&amp;rsquo;ve got some reading to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vemav--liquidity-directing-voting-vote-directed-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;veMAV &amp;amp; Liquidity Directing Voting (vote-directed liquidity shaping)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/vemav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;vemav&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the MAV token is sequential, currently in phase 1, where users can claim their drop, LP MAV, or lock it to obtain veMAV. &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 will introduce Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Directing Voting and mark the true beginning of the MAV races.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is, of course, the expressivity enabled by Maverick that will also impact the tokenomics: unlike on veCRV or veBAL, where projects allocate liquidity to a whole pool, here, with Maverick, &lt;strong&gt;protocols will be able to target their voting power to a specific part of the AMM distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more information on veMAV here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/introducing-maverick-protocols-voting-escrow-model-c29a60120339&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introducing Maverick Protocol&amp;rsquo;s Voting-Escrow Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maverick--vemav-x-chain-strategy&#34;&gt;Maverick &amp;amp; veMAV X-chain strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical thing to note with the MAV token is that it implements &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/layerzero-omnichain-contracts/oft&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Layer Zero&amp;rsquo;s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard&lt;/a&gt;, greatly facilitating cross-chain operations. It enables MAV to exist natively on every chain and should ease the operational overhard for the team to launch the gauge system on a new network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem much at first glance, but it could make a massive difference. Indeed, Curve and Balancer have been slow to export their full gauge model to networks other than the mainnet they initially operate on. &lt;strong&gt;I expect Maverick to move much more quickly&lt;/strong&gt;, and the early empirical data validate it. In ~3 months of existence, Maverick has already launched two chains apart from mainnet: zkSync and BSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;another-main-difference-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Another main difference with veCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;veMAV implements several other changes compared to a base veCRV model, and I invite you to identify them all. Here are some other ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The veMAV per MAV weighting is not linear here, even if it still favors max lockers (4 years); the min lock of 1 week gives one veMAV/MAV, while max locking gives 5veMAV/MAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no linear decay&lt;/strong&gt; like on veCRV - which is a significant UX improvement. It could also have very positive consequences for veMAV liquid wrappers, making it easier to keep close to the peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet there are still incentives to stay committed. Indeed, The veMAV/MAV ratio is computed with the formula &lt;code&gt;1.5^(lock end - contract launch)&lt;/code&gt;. With the lock end as the main parameter, veMAV lockers who want to maximize their power must extend their lock frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding wrappers, several existing projects have already expressed their intention of building on top of Maverick or veMAV, including Paladin, SpiralDAO, and StakeDAO. The MAV wars will be vicious, so read the fine print before locking your MAV somewhere else than in the veMAV contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forward-outlook--parting-words&#34;&gt;Forward outlook &amp;amp; parting words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick is currently live on mainnet, zkSync, and BSC. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to remark on how much it dominates the volume on zkSync, even with a fraction of its competitor TVL:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/zksync-dex-tvl.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;zksync-dex-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mainnet, most of the success has been found with ETH-LSDs pairs (wstETH, swETH, etc.) and stablecoins. Maverick&amp;rsquo;s efficient liquidity structure is highly competitive with Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On volatile tokens, LPs are a bit shy still, just like it took a few months for people to get used to the novelty brought in by Uniswap V3. Interestingly, LPs are experimenting more on zkSync, especially on pairs such as ETH/USDC, thanks to the lowered gas costs, leading to an overall capital efficiency even more significant than on mainnet, here are the stats for today (July 06 2023):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap V3 - mainnet: 0.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - mainnet: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - zkSync: 0.93&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started-with-maverick-as-a-user&#34;&gt;Getting started with Maverick as a user
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a learning curve for Maverick, as understanding how to structure liquidity properly can be intimidating because of all the options provided. Yet more options mean more expressivity and, thus, more efficiency and returns when adequately harnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make the most of Maverick as a user and discover the protocol in an environment with low fees, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend supplying your first LPs on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt; - as it will enable you to modify them at a low cost if needed. Like most new DeFi products, the best way to master it is to use it and see it behaves in various market conditions, so get at it: you might also be double-dipping on airdrops so that it can be quite a rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to check out the Boosted Pools, which - in addition to their incentives - have a pre-defined liquidity configuration, making them more accessible to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-managers-its-time-to-wake-up&#34;&gt;Liquidity Managers, it&amp;rsquo;s time to wake up!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the project side, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute necessity for liquidity managers to understand and master Maverick&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s by far the venue delivering the most liquidity efficiency. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them in the process, since it has become a specialty of mine. Feel free to reach out if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss how your project could harness liquidity shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the next few months of the DEX wars will unfold; with Maverick already consistently in the top 5 of Ethereum DEXes by volume processed, I think it&amp;rsquo;s no stretch to envision it breaking into the top 3 by the end of year latest as the veMAV gauges will be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand the paradigm shift that lies with the transition from liquidity mining / basic ve(3,3) to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse implementing vote-directed liquidity shaping. Feel free to follow the events live, monitoring onchain data like as OGs do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solidly/Velodrome forks have been popping up like mushrooms, especially across the popular layer 2 like Arbitrum or zkSync. Solidly is now the top #3 forked protocol in DeFi and one of the rare cases where the forks (such as Velodrome) are the market leaders. At first glance, it could seem like just another fork hype train, like when we had the Uni/Sushi fork season, Olympus fork season, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, it’s overblown: an absurd amount of such DEXes are launching weekly, and 95% of them won’t be relevant six months from now. However, like with most of such hype trains, there is deep down, below the fluff, an actual fundamental innovation in how decentralized exchanges are designed that is worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article will dive deep into the Solidly and Velodrome models to understand why they became a standard fork template. With that said, we’ll be in an excellent position to ponder the next steps for these DEXes and what this market might look like in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get right to it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV Wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-ve33-dexes&#34;&gt;Introduction to ve(3,3) DEXes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how Solidly built on top and tried to improve the veCRV model, let’s take a step back to consider the scope first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amm-structure-vs-incentivization-layer&#34;&gt;AMM Structure VS Incentivization Layer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to grasp the ve(3,3) DEXes story, we need to distinguish between two layers that are equally important for a decentralized exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure layer&lt;/strong&gt;: the various AMM models used to sustain liquidity, such as UNIv2’s x*y=k or Curve’s stableswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;: fees + all other incentives directed to the liquidity provider, including token emissions (such as in the CRV model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the end of the day, 1 – the liquidity structure – is the heart of the game, the second layer – incentives – is crucial in attracting and sustaining sufficient liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve innovated on both. While the models we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss today harnessed it, they &lt;strong&gt;focus entirely on improving the incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed at the current stage, most of ve(3,3) DEXes harnessing the Solidly or Velodrome model only offer two well-known liquidity structure types: x*y=k &amp;amp; stableswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the DEXes, those two liquidity models are called correlated/volatile or stable/volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about what was so interesting about Andre’s Cronje original Solidly and what insights we can draw from its failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;andre-cronjes-solidly-innovations&#34;&gt;Andre Cronje’s Solidly Innovations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in early 2022 on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cronje’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, the crucial part of Solidly’s vision was a significant improvement in the utility for lockers. On Curve, lockers are committed for four years with non-transferable vote-escrowed tokens. While it’s great for the long-term incentives alignment of all the participants of the Curve ecosystem, it also creates a sizable barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus came ve(3,3), with at its core &lt;strong&gt;the veNFT&lt;/strong&gt;. While veCRV are illiquid, veSOLID positions are represented by the veNFT, enabling their transfer or OTC sale/purchase. It helps make locking less scary. To further incentivize it, Cronje introduced “&lt;strong&gt;anti-dilutive rebases&lt;/strong&gt;”, a concept drawn from Ampleforth/Olympus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is simple: since the Curve/Solidly DEX model emits tokens weekly to liquidity providers, vetokens holders are constantly diluted. They must keep increasing their position even to maintain their current vote share. To compensate for this, veSOLID holders receive a weekly rebase proportional to the weekly emissions under the Solidly model. This allows them to maintain their voting share even if no new tokens are locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these changes, Solidly inherited most of the Curve model, including &lt;strong&gt;the LP boost&lt;/strong&gt; feature, enabling vetokens holders to earn boosted yields on their liquidity position. This feature has real consequences since it pretty much “calls for a Convex.” Indeed, the logical conclusion of such a feature is one/a few actors seizing significant amounts of vetokens and providing their LP boost to depositors for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence/absence of this feature is the critical difference between the Solidly and Velodrome models, so we’ll touch back on it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there one last critical twist to the voter incentives model. On Curve, LP get half of the trading fees collected + CRV emissions, while voters have no exposure to the fees of the pool they are voting on. It can lead to situation where voters are voting for pools just for the bribes, even if the pool provides no volume to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Solidly, the LPs are only rewarded with SOLID emission, and the LP fees are redirected to the voters of the pool. Thus, as a veSOLID holder, to optimize your earnings, you are incentivized to consider the volume on the pool you are voting on, and not just the bribes. This leads to a better alignment of the incentives of the main participants of the protocol (swapper, liquidity provider, veHolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly also innovated on the launch strategy, with &lt;strong&gt;an airdrop targeted at protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their onchain activity on Fantom, where Solidly was. Together, all those innovations and the hype led to a massive amount of liquidity quickly attracted to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Solidly’s initial implementation had a few key weaknesses, including an aggressively steep decline in emissions and fully permissionless gauge creation that allowed any pools to receive SOLID rewards. It was gamable, so it was gamed. Soon, tokens were created for the sole purpose of farming SOLID, and the price quickly spiraled, along with the TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/solidly-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cover-image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TVL disappeared as quickly as it came, and Solidly became a part of history for most. But those who followed the events closely knew that Solidly’s failure did not come from a weakness in the ve(3,3) model but more of &lt;strong&gt;an overlooked detail of its implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that while Solidly was no more, ve(3,3) would likely resurface. And it did, a few months later, on another chain made by another team: enter Velodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;velodromes-refinements-to-the-solidly-model&#34;&gt;Velodrome’s refinements to the Solidly model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; harnessed the Solidly model and fixed the issue with emissions by implementing a &lt;strong&gt;whitelist for gauges&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to avoid the situation where rewards are allocated to made-up tokens, as seen on Solidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome went far beyond a mere fork, though, and implemented further improvements; among them were a more sustainable emissions model and &lt;strong&gt;removing the LP boost feature&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning there is no preferential treatment for veVELO holders in terms of yield. Velodrome also streamlines the experience for first-time LPs who might be confused with the yield range you see on DEXes with LP boost implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical features, a large part of Velodrome’s success is due to the &lt;strong&gt;team’s execution and care for the business development strategies&lt;/strong&gt;, an essential part of the ve(3,3) model. Built on Optimism, Velodrome found its PMF as the chain liquidity layer. Thanks to its model, sustaining liquidity on Velodrome is much more cost-effective for projects than, say, on Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Solidly, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome airdropped several protocols with a veVELO NFT,&lt;/strong&gt; no strings attached, which helped immensely to attract the initial voting and bribing activity. The protocol found a good fit, mostly with other protocols emitting stablecoins or ETH liquid stake derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/defiwars-velodrome.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defiwars-velodrome&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost a year, and the activity has sustained, thanks to careful and progressive adjustments of the &lt;strong&gt;OP incentives allocated on the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/tour-de-op-updates-631268181baa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tour de OP&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are used to incentivize two behaviors essential to sustain the flywheel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes from protocols, incentivized by OP bribes matching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking of veVELO, incentivized by an OP lock bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribe matching is further increased for projects which lock veVELO or deploy sizeable amounts of protocol-owned liquidity to the exchange, helping further amplify the reinforcing effect: those who want to build liquidity sustained over the long term on Velodrome have been given solid reasons to buy VELO, lock and vote, bribe, and supply POL, &lt;strong&gt;ideally all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to Velodrome topping the protocols TVL charts on Optimism and processing about 30% of the total volume of the chain vs 50% for Uniswap, which has roughly ¼ of Velodrome’s TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/optimism-volume.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;optimism-DEX-volume&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why such a spread between the both? Simple: Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s Volume/TVL ratio is ~9x above Velodrome right now because the liquidity on Uniswap is much more concentrated and thus more efficient. But it’s about to change as Velodrome V2 is arriving soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-velodrome-v2&#34;&gt;Introducing Velodrome V2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap had a headstart with concentrated liquidity, it will change rapidly. The v3 license &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/governance/liscense-modifications&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;expired on April 1st 2023&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the model is now much easier to re-implement. Many DEXes, including Solidly/Velodrome forks, intend to harness this. Still, to keep this article focused, we’ll only cover what is announced for Velodrome V2, expected in the next few weeks/months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Velodrome V2 will not just mark &lt;strong&gt;the introduction of UNI-v3 style of LP on the DEX&lt;/strong&gt; but also significant UX/UI improvements, a relayer to ease the management of veNFT, artwork for the veNFT, and much more. Check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-road-ah-43488531bb0e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;V2 announcement article&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you understand the benefits of the Solidly and Velodrome models. While I mention the myriad of forks in the introduction, I’ve stayed on course with this article. I guess this calls for a follow-up where I comb through their main forks and the modifications they implement into the template: stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Business Development&lt;/strong&gt; | ve(3,3), just like Curve, are protocols for protocols. The team&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and ability to efficiently prioritize and executive on BD is a sizable success factor of the DEX over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the launch/airdrop/top racers rooster&lt;/strong&gt; | Even if BD is done well, a given ve(3,3) DEX is only as good as its top racers. Yes, you want them bribing, voting, and driving awareness, but not only. The quality of the liquidity driven to the DEX also matters (volume/TVL ratio).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LP Boost and its consequences&lt;/strong&gt; | If a ve(3,3) implements LP boost, it calls for Convex-like protocols. The success of the ve(3,3) will be impacted by how much and how well its Convex-likes do. To follow the key stats on the various wrappers and main veTokens holders, check - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiWars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ve(3,3) + Liquidity Concentration&lt;/strong&gt; | While ve(3,3) is a significant innovation for the incentives layer of the DEX, it currently harnesses sub-par liquidity structures. Properly matching the ve(3,3) incentives model with an efficient UNIv3-style liquidity structure will help further improve the effectiveness of the flywheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-x-tokenbrice/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-x-tokenbrice/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/maverick-x-tokenbrice-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is more of a personal announcement: I wanted to let you know what I am up to and what&amp;rsquo;s happening with Maverick. So let&amp;rsquo;s not beat around the bush: I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce that &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m supporting the Maverick team as an advisor, helping with the growth strategy, tokenomics, and business development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;storytime&#34;&gt;Storytime
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like me, you must be over-saturated with DEXes. If you follow DeFi closely, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen several of these launches daily. Yet most still adopt fundamental liquidity structures: x*y=k for volatile pairs and stableswap, and focus on innovating on the tokenomics instead: the now famous ve(3,3) DEXes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a DEX that would innovate at the fundamental level&lt;/strong&gt; for a while, so in May last year, when Bob reached out to let me know about Maverick, I was all ears. I quickly realized Maverick could reshape how we envision liquidity in DeFi and help further improve its efficiency. So I’m glad to announce my involvement today: Maverick is already live, growing quickly, and poised for even exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we dive into what makes Maverick so interesting, we need to take a step back and consider the broader context of liquidity in DeFi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-structuring-deep-dive&#34;&gt;Liquidity Structuring Deep Dive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning, there was Uniswap&lt;/strong&gt;, and its ease of use for liquidity providers led people to believe it was a trivial activity. Yet, any liquidity-providing activity on a DEX involves two decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking a pair (or more) of tokens (ex: ETH/USDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;Forming price assumptions regarding one/both tokens (🐂, 🐻, or 🦀)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second decision is &lt;strong&gt;often implicit&lt;/strong&gt;, like with UniswapV2, where you get no option but only one choice: 50/50, meaning that your optimal scenario is both tokens going sideways in price with a large trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Uniswap V3 emerged, the second assumption was suddenly more explicit to DeFi users thanks to concentrated liquidity. However, V3 added complexity to the liquidity provider experience and active management. It &lt;strong&gt;mainly caters to power-users who can afford frequent rebalancing&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;require external tooling&lt;/strong&gt; to be harnessed effectively by LPs, the liquidity manager – Arrakis, Bunni, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-unique-about-maverick&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s unique about Maverick?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Maverick is the spiritual descendant of UniV3 and CurveV2. It offers infinite flexibility in the design of liquidity-providing position, similar to Uniswap V3, but with streamlined and autonomous execution, just like on Curve. Indeed, LPs on Maverick can decide to redistribute their liquidity to follow the price in one or both directions. &lt;strong&gt;If needed, the rebalancing is done at the DEX level, ensuring gas efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt; Maverick also supports “static pools” that are range-bound too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This feature makes Maverick a fantastic fit for pegged assets, especially those that are not continually trading precisely at the peg&lt;/strong&gt; and so underserved by the usual liquidity structures, such as a LUSD/USDC pair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve stableswap, which optimizes liquidity for a 1/1 price, is not ideal when LUSD is overpeg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap v3, where LPs usually end up super concentrated around the current market price, which is efficient, but also quickly through them out of range as the price move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-mode-both&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Maverick, such a pair can be harnessed optimally by each LP, depending on their actual goal. &lt;strong&gt;It enables each LP to craft an automatically adjusting position that enforces a strategy fitting his assumptions and needs&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are some examples of goals &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; liquidity structure matching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🎚️ | Looking for a safe yield with minimal risk? A static LP might be preferable, as the outcomes are predictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🐂/🐻 | Thinking LUSD is currently over/undervalued: you can supply directional liquidity and earn extra if your assumption verifies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🦀 | Want to bet on volume with prices going sideways? You can simply focus your liquidity a few bins around the price and activate the &lt;strong&gt;left-right mode&lt;/strong&gt; to constantly rebalance the current price, thus maximizing the available liquidity and fees collected but also the potential impermanent loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Maverick has found &lt;strong&gt;a beast of a product/market fit on pools like wstETH/ETH&lt;/strong&gt;, often averaging over 100% daily utilization rate. Here’s today, for instance (4/20):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve: TVL = $1.5B, Volume =$34M, Utilization = 2,26%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick: TVL = $10.6M, Volume =$10.45M, &lt;strong&gt;Utilization = 98,5%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/mav-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Maverick Top Pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched just a few weeks ago on the Ethereum mainnet, Maverick is already seeing an impressive volume and unprecedented liquidity utilization rate, especially on pegged asset pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick was also launched on zkSync, its first L2, a few days ago. As more staple DeFi projects roll out service there, Maverick will have many opportunities to demonstrate the superior efficiency its liquidity designs can offer to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about the next steps: as a DeFi Strategist at Liquity, the release of Maverick felt like early Christmas to me; I think it&amp;rsquo;s just getting started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll contribute to Maverick as an advisor, meaning that my main focus remains my commitment to immutable protocols, especially Liquity, helping them grow through various onchain and offchain activities. I’m confident Maverick will quickly prove to be a decisive tool in achieving that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just hearing about Maverick? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mav.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Liquity-driver token races beyond Curve: a look at the Balancer Wars</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/balancer-wars/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/balancer-wars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/balancer-wars-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Liquity-driver token races beyond Curve: a look at the Balancer Wars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity-driver tokens, as I call them, are an emergent and fascinating construction. Simply put, these tokens enable you to direct incentives (CRV, BAL, etc.) to the liquidity pool of your choice. To do so, you must usually own and lock the corresponding token (veCRV, veBAL, etc.) within their governance contract, ensuring continuous commitment from participating projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the liquidity-driver tokens quickly became highly sought after by DAOs with constant and usually growing liquidity needs. It led to what we call “races” (or &amp;ldquo;wars&amp;rdquo;): a term that refers to the various strategies projects harness to constantly increase their veTokens stash, ideally faster than the other participants of the races, to grow a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve covered the CRV tokenomics, the pioneer of the veToken model, and their consequences in this blog extensively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

/content/posts/2022/crv-wars-l2.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vetokenomics-beyond-the-curve-ecosystem&#34;&gt;veTokenomics, beyond the Curve ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Curve is fascinating to study, as it’s the veCRV pioneer and still the most mature and dense implementation of ve tokenomics to date, there are now many other race instances with their twists worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the veCRV tokenomics is more than two years old, and many other projects have launched or revamped their tokenomics since, drawing inspiration from Curve’s model. Without being exhaustive, here are the other “races” I follow the most closely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solidly pioneered the “ve(3,3)” model (attempting to build and improve on the base ve model) on Fantom in February 2022, quickly attracting billions of TVL before &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackmd.io/@c30/BJ2PNCwgs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;failing dramatically because of very poor execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.velodrome.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;, a fork of Solidly fixing its critical issues, quickly found its place on Optimism after launching in June 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://balancer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer&lt;/a&gt; — a historical alternative to Curve and Uniswap, a chain agnostic DEX packing interesting innovations, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-is-live-aeda1ae13e20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recently switched to a vemodel in March 2022.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SolidlyETH&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Solidly&lt;/a&gt;, again. Indeed, while the first project failed, the community gathered to take over and is about to re-launch Solidly, this time on mainnet, making it much more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am myself a liquidity-driver addict, as I was sharing recently on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All projects have constant liquidity needs; addressing them sustainably is highly valuable. Indeed, the value of liquidity-driver tokens exceeds what DAOs/projects can draw from them: $1 worth of vote-bribing can move &amp;gt;$1 worth of incentives. Individual participants can also gain a lot by being able to position themselves early in a relevant race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the stage set, let’s dive into today’s matter: Balancer, their BAL races, and the “BAL-Layer-2” infrastructure that emerged on top of it, just like it happened with Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mapping-the-balancer-trinity&#34;&gt;Mapping the Balancer Trinity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/balancer-trinity.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;balancer-trinity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we documented Curve, we watched the ecosystem grow together on this blog. With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://balancer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer&lt;/a&gt;, I’m covering it extensively for the first time and already looking at a mature ecosystem. Balancer already has “its Convex,” called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aura.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aura Finance&lt;/a&gt;. It already controls over 25% of the veBAL (vs &amp;gt;50% of veCRV for Convex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Balancer base infrastructure calls for a third component: an automation network necessary to enable the most advanced type of pools. At this stage, it’s still unclear who is leading this race, so I’ve used one of their most prominent participants – &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://powerpool.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PowerPool&lt;/a&gt; and its PowerAgents network — to play the part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with UniswapV3 liquidity provisioning, one could say PowerAgents play a role similar to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gelato.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gelato&lt;/a&gt;: it handles the automation of operations required to enable specific use cases, such as rewards harvesting and auto-compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-balancer-different&#34;&gt;What makes Balancer different?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Uniswap and Curve, Balancer has been one of the longest-standing DEX with significant traction today. Indeed, looking at the DEX market from a global perspective, Balancer is scoring fifth place with about 3% of the total volume processed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancer&amp;rsquo;s first version launched in March 2020, and many iterations have been shipped since then, improving the BAL token model and liquidity structure. However, Balancer had &lt;strong&gt;specificities since V1&lt;/strong&gt; that are probably key in explaining why it’s still standing today. I’ll focus on the most emblematic, Balancer-specific ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pool-supporting-2-to-8-assets&#34;&gt;Pool supporting 2 to 8 assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancer is still, to this day, one of the only DEX offering such a wide range of pool structures. Indeed, a Balancer pool can be made of &lt;strong&gt;any number ranging from 2 to 8 assets&lt;/strong&gt;, while most other DEX only support pairs, so two assets at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables novel types of pools, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 assets pools, such as the wBTC/USDC/wETH pool similar to Curve’s TriCrypto pool, or to diversify the pairing of a given token, like the OHM/ETH/DAI pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or even 7-8 asset pools that start acting as token indexes as much as liquidity pools, such as the YFI/wBTC/COMP/wETH/UNI/CHZ/LINK pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arbitrary-pool-weighting&#34;&gt;Arbitrary pool weighting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the flexible support in terms of the number of tokens, &lt;strong&gt;pool weighting does not need to be even across tokens&lt;/strong&gt; and can be extensively customized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enables unbalanced pool structures that are very useful in certain situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance, the OHM/DAI/ETH pool mentioned above is &lt;strong&gt;50%OHM, 25%DAI, and 25%wETH&lt;/strong&gt; – enabling the maximization of the OHM liquidity available against both DAI and ETH at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another frequently used distribution is the &lt;strong&gt;98/2&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly fitting to start building the liquidity of a newly released token with minimal IL risk (since 98% of the pool is composed of the safe pairing asset, like a stable or ETH)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;80% Token / 20% pairing asset&lt;/strong&gt; such as 80% BAL / 20% wETH is also a highly sought-after liquidity distribution, as it enables token holders to partake in liquidity providing activities with minimized IL risks if the token was to appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-pool-weighting&#34;&gt;Dynamic pool weighting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Balancer can adjust the pool weighting distribution as needed through a specific type of pool called a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquidity Boostraping Pool (LBP)&lt;/a&gt;. Such pools are particularly fitting for launching tokens &amp;amp; building their liquidity at the same time, as they enable the streamlined go-to-market token flow. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A given project wants to quickstart its token liquidity — the associated DAO controls a significant amount of the token, but usually none of the potential pairing asset (usually ETH or stablecoin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So they start with a 98% USDC / 2% Token pool, enabling them to provide liquidity with minimal pairing token requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pool acts as a token initiation event and price discovery mechanism at the same time. The token starts at a given price, which decreases as time goes on if no one purchases the token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/LBP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;balancer-trinity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBPs are designed to enable users interested in the project to purchase tokens fairly over a given period, protecting them against the usual attacks seen on more classical tokens launches (such as MEV bots sniping initial supply).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables the user-DAO to accumulate the pairing token and first price discovery of the DAO’s token, making it easy to jump to the next step: quickstart the token liquidity with protocol-owned seeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;specificities-of-balancers-vemodel&#34;&gt;Specificities of Balancer’s veModel
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancer also has implemented its twist on their Curve’s inspired locking mechanism. Here, instead of locking the token directly (CRV ⇒ veCRV), governance participants must &lt;strong&gt;lock an LP token&lt;/strong&gt; corresponding to the Balancer &lt;strong&gt;80% BAL / 20% wETH&lt;/strong&gt; pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, this liquidity distribution limits IL risks for depositors on a BAL upside. Thanks to this twist, Balancer can capture significant liquidity reserves through the normal operations of its governance participation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as of late, it seems like Balancer is focusing on interest-bearing tokens and developing new use cases to cater to them. For instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-pt-2-bribing-and-bip19s-free-bribes-b2f8334eba14&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BIP#19&lt;/a&gt; introduces “free bribes” for pools involving interest-bearing assets: the yield produced by the pool asset is recycled as a bribe to sustain its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lay-of-the-land-of-the-balancer-wars&#34;&gt;Lay of the land of the Balancer Wars
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Curve, Balancer has one dominant player of its race which developed a protocol optimized for synergy with Balancer: Aura. Aura is one of many services available in the Balancer-functional-L2 ecosystem, but a vastly dominant one with ~25% of all veBAL under the protocol control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aura offers efficient farming to holders of Balancer LP tokens, with BAL rewards boosted thanks to the protocol&amp;rsquo;s sizeable veBAL stash and additional AURA incentives. In that regard, it is the same thing as Convex to Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocols-with-vebalvlaura-positions&#34;&gt;Protocols with veBAL/vlAURA positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the protocols working on liquid-wrapper for veBAL like Aura, some other DAOs and projects built sizeable veBAL/vlAURA positions to grow and sustain their liquidity, like Frax is doing on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancer-bribe-markets&#34;&gt;Balancer Bribe Markets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bribe markets are enabling the purchase of veBAL or vlAURA votes; here are the main ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hiddenhand.finance/aura&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Hidden Hand – Balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/quest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Paladin’s Warden Balancer Quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://votemarket.stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;And StakeDAO BAL Votemarket&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of bribing marketplace aggregator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow the Balancer wars, make sure to harness the amazing data computed by the Llama Airforce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/llama-airforce-aura.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;llama-airforce-aura&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on the graph, the bribing markets took off quickly before finding an equilibrium at around &lt;strong&gt;$0.06 per AURA vote, translating into 1.50x bribes efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: $1 spent bribing the vote results in $1.50 worth of BAL emission added to the targeted pool over the epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure is lower on the Curve races, around 1.25x for the Convex vlCVX bribing. It’s logical since Curve races are much older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-balancer&#34;&gt;What’s next for Balancer?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complement the traction achieved thanks to the tokenomics revamp and switch to veBAL, several technical developments have been shipped/are coming to the Balancer DEX and should help further cement its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;boosted-pools&#34;&gt;Boosted Pools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one is the boosted pool, which is already live. They optimize the yields produced by liquidity providers by harnessing additional IL-free yield sources with tokens not needed to stomach the liquidity-providing activity. The bb-a-USD, Balancer’s 3pool equivalent, is the top Boosted Pool currently, but more are coming, including a LUSD-based one: LUCY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/introduction-to-powerpool-lucy-pool-and-what-it-brings-to-lusd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduction to PowerPool&amp;rsquo;s LUCY pool and what it brings to $LUSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aave-x-balancer&#34;&gt;Aave x Balancer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aave and Balancer have historic ties, with Aave Safety Module harnessing Balancer V1, and Aave even shipping a V2 market a few years ago to leverage Balancer LP tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further collaborations are anticipated, as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave acquired BAL tokens recently&lt;/a&gt; and will face dramatically increased liquidity needs with the GHO release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancer-home-of-the-lsds&#34;&gt;Balancer: home of the LSDs?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, looking at the current top pool TVL-wise on Balancer, a clear fit is emerging: liquid staked derivatives, such as Rocket Pool’s rETH or Lido’s stETH. Both have sizeable pools properly incentivized on Balancer mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lido’s wstETH/wETH pool even flipped the 80BAL/20wETH pool and became the top one of the DEX with $200M TVL. Similarly, stMATIC/wMATIC is the top Balancer/Polygon pool, followed by MATICX/wMATIC, featuring another liquid MATIC staking derivative. On Arbitrum, the third and last chain where Balancer is live, here again, the wstETH/wETH pool tops the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I hope this article provided you with actionable insights regarding liquidity-driver tokens, I wanted to add another layer: it seems like a &lt;strong&gt;subcategory&lt;/strong&gt; of liquidity-driver is emerging – &lt;strong&gt;the lending liquidity-driver token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work very similarly, but instead of enabling their holders to direct incentives to liquidity pools, they allow them to &lt;strong&gt;direct incentives to select lending markets&lt;/strong&gt;. So, in the end, they accomplish a different goal through a similar mean: controlling a lot of these lending-liquidity-driver tokens, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://euler.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Euler Finance’s&lt;/a&gt; EUL, allows for sustaining deep liquidity in lending markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably worth looking at; I’ve been anticipating the arrival of ve and ve(3,3) based tokenomics to money markets for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chicken Bonds: an NFT-powered hatching factory to beat DeFi’s liquidity chicken and egg problem</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/lusd-chicken-bonds/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/lusd-chicken-bonds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/lusd-chicken-bonds-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post Chicken Bonds: an NFT-powered hatching factory to beat DeFi’s liquidity chicken and egg problem" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity recently released the LUSD Chicken Bonds, a &lt;strong&gt;game-theory experiment merging DeFi and NFT elements to grow LUSD’s liquidity and reduce its price premium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Chicken Bonds are building on top of existing protocols, such as Yearn, b.protocol, or Curve, it also instigates novel mechanisms, the two leading ones being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No maturity principal-protected bonding&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicken Bonds use a new type of bonding offering strong guarantees to the depositor, including the possibility to recoup the entire initially supplied capital at no cost (Chicken Out).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate to Earn dynamic NFT&lt;/strong&gt;: While interacting with the LUSD Chicken Bonds protocol, users obtain a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic NFT&lt;/strong&gt; that evolves depending on their choices and previous onchain interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds tackle one of the core challenges of DeFi, the sustainable growth of liquidity pools, first for the LUSD token only. Still, eventually, the model will be made available in a generalizable permissionless version for any protocol in need of liquidity to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explores how &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chickenbonds.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LUSD Chicken Bonds&lt;/a&gt; work and what they achieve. However, before answering these questions, additional context is needed on LUSD: let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context-lusd-price-premium&#34;&gt;The context: LUSD price premium
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most misunderstood dimensions of Liquity’s model is &lt;strong&gt;LUSD pegging mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, while LUSD has strong guarantees (hard peg) than LUSD&amp;gt;$1.00 (redemption) and &amp;lt;$1.10 (110% minimal collateralization ratio), in between the equilibrium is more based on a &lt;strong&gt;game of incentives (soft peg)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/tornado-cash-sanctions-challenges/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OFAC’s crackdown on Tornado Cash&lt;/a&gt; back in August, there has been an &lt;strong&gt;increased demand&lt;/strong&gt; for censorship-resistant stablecoins. Yet, the &lt;strong&gt;appetite for leverage is low&lt;/strong&gt; because of the deteriorated market conditions. Thus, will the demand for LUSD is high, a significant share of its adopters purchase it at a premium on the markets instead of minting it by leveraging their ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both factors have converged over the last few months, leading to a &lt;strong&gt;sustained price premium&lt;/strong&gt; for LUSD, often trading in the $1.02 to $1.04 range. I won’t expand too deeply into this topic here, as it has already been covered on Liquity’s blog: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Premium of Resiliency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, let’s discuss &lt;strong&gt;the impact of the premium on Liquity users&lt;/strong&gt; since it has real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-the-lusd-premium&#34;&gt;Impact of the LUSD premium
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of a price premium on borrowers &lt;strong&gt;can be positive or negative&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their timing and actions. Borrowers worried about LUSD price volatility can use Chicken Bonds, or b.protocol to preserve a pure LUSD exposure while earning yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that borrowers who preserve a 100% LUSD exposure do not suffer any consequence from its price fluctuations since they do not need to buy it back when repaying their debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having LUSD fluctuates can also benefit informed users that can arbitrage the discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit margin&lt;/strong&gt; | The more LUSD goes over $1, the more profitable it is to take an arbitrage trade on its peg: at $1.01, shorting the peg returns $0.01 per LUSD if successful. At $1.09, the profits jump to $0.09 per LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Likelihood of profits being realized&lt;/strong&gt; | The farther away LUSD strands from $1.00, and the closer it gets to $1.10, the more likely it is for peg arbitrageurs to outweigh LUSD buyers and thus push the price downward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus arbitraging LUSD is a game of balance between maximizing profits (1) and their odds of realizing (2). To put it simply: past a certain price point, the arbitrage trade becomes &lt;strong&gt;too profitable and too likely to realize for arbitrageurs to ignore&lt;/strong&gt;. It has helped to ensure that LUSD stayed in the lower bond of its soft peg, the $1.00-$1.05 range, even during phases of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users who do not monitor the situation continuously, though, it can translate into a loss of capital — for instance, if one borrows LUSD while the price is at $1.02, invest it into something else, and then weeks later try to buy back LUSD to repay its debt, only to find the price at $1.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, LUSD’s fluctuations in the $1.00-1.10 range add &lt;strong&gt;an additional layer of uncertainty for borrowers&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing the liquidity of LUSD and stabilizing its peg will help restore the borrowers’ confidence and streamline interactions with the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve LUSD’s liquidity challenge, the Liquity team worked on a &lt;strong&gt;brand new protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, first tried out with LUSD: Chicken Bonds. If successful, the model will be generalized with an LQTY instance. As a final step, the generalized model could be made ready to be harnessed by any DAO with the Chicken Bond Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.chickenbonds.org/blog-posts/chicken-bonds-is-live&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the LUSD Chicken Bonds were released&lt;/a&gt;, offering &lt;strong&gt;a novel proposition merging DeFi and NFTs&amp;rsquo; elements providing optimized yield-producing opportunities to LUSD holders&lt;/strong&gt;. It will also fuel the growth of LUSD’s liquidity on the LUSD/3CRV Curve pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two protagonists interacting with Chicken Bonds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The depositors (users)&lt;/strong&gt; enjoy a gamified experience delivering &lt;strong&gt;amplified and auto-compounded yields on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deployer (protocol)&lt;/strong&gt; sets up an &lt;strong&gt;engine enabling the sustained growth and capture of liquidity on its token&lt;/strong&gt; while actively engaging its holders.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-exactly-are-chicken-bonds&#34;&gt;So, what exactly are Chicken Bonds?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Chicken Bonds fulfill the function of different types of products depending on the perspective. &lt;strong&gt;For users, Chicken Bonds act like an NFT-enhanced yield optimizer&lt;/strong&gt;. Bonding enables them to maximize their returns on LUSD by optimizing the compounding frequency and amplifying the existing yields. From their perspective, they could compare the utility of Chicken Bonds to the one already delivered by a protocol like Yearn, lacking the NFT element. It maximizes and streamlines yield-producing activities on LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the deployer (protocol) perspective, Chicken Bonds are a &lt;strong&gt;cost-effective solution to develop the available liquidity on their token&lt;/strong&gt;. Alternative solutions to achieve a similar goal would include liquidity mining, POL-capture solution like Olympus Pro, acquiring liquidity-driver tokens (CRV, BAL, VELO, etc.)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or bribing liquidity-driver token owner votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/chicken-egg.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;chicken-egg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While each existing solution has its own tradeoffs, they all share a similar profile: they &lt;strong&gt;require recurring expenses to grow and sustain liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;. Only the acquisition of liquidity-driver tokens can provide continuous incentives to support liquidity, but it’s also the most costly approach as it requires significant investments from projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Chicken Bonds have no cost as they harness existing yield sources: &lt;strong&gt;all it needs to capture and grow liquidity is time&lt;/strong&gt;. They harness a novel form of &lt;strong&gt;no-maturity principal-protected bonding&lt;/strong&gt;, offering amplified yields and strong protections for the depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain the model of LUSD Chicken Bonds, let’s jump to the depositor perspective by looking at the lifecycle of a bond and its impact on the associated NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story-of-a-bond-through-its-nft&#34;&gt;The story of a bond through its NFT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/3chickens-static.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3chickens&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create a bond, a user deposits LUSD. In exchange, he receives an 🥚 Egg NFT representing his deposit&lt;/strong&gt;. The NFT contains the claim on the underlying bonded LUSD and can be sold or transferred. From thereon, the user has two mutually exclusive options that will transform his NFT too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🐔 Chicken In&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or 🐣 Chicken Out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egg NFTs have four attributes: a card, egg, and background colors rolled randomly, and an egg-size scaling with the deposited LUSD amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an egg is created, it starts progressively accruing bLUSD. As the bond matures, it becomes profitable for the users to claim it, forgoing their LUSD to obtain the bLUSD accumulated — It’s the “&lt;strong&gt;Chicken In&lt;/strong&gt;” option and makes the visual of the NFT evolve accordingly: the Egg turns into a 🐔 &lt;strong&gt;Proud Chicken&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user can recover the full invested amount at any time during the process. Still, he will renounce the bLUSD accumulated so far — it’s the “&lt;strong&gt;Chicken Out&lt;/strong&gt;” option and also leads to an evolution of the NFT from the Egg to a 🐣 &lt;strong&gt;Scared Chick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;going-deeper-into-the-chicken-bonds-nft&#34;&gt;Going deeper into the Chicken Bonds NFT
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chickening In, the NFT gains additional attributes rolled at random (comb, tail, beak, and wings) and special attributes depending on the wallet onchain activities. Wallets engaged in the following activities are eligible for special attributes or boosted chances at rolling rarer ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a Liquity Trove with ongoing debt,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning LQTY, or staking it either directly or with Pickle,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting for the LUSD/3CRV gauge (veCRV holders).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT collection also harnesses interesting mechanisms, such as the &lt;strong&gt;affinity&lt;/strong&gt; to generate the coolest chickens possible; read the dedicated article on Liquity’s blog for more information on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;NFT x DeFi: Deep dive into LUSD Chicken Bonds&amp;rsquo; Dynamic NFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;boostedlusd-blusd-a-yield-enhanced-auto-compounded-lusd&#34;&gt;boostedLUSD (bLUSD): a yield-enhanced auto-compounded LUSD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bonding and eventually Chickening In, depositors can accumulate bLUSD, but you might wonder at this point why this token can be desirable: let’s dive into the beefy DeFi side of Chicken Bonds!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is that &lt;strong&gt;owning bLUSD provides access to auto-compounded and amplified yields on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. bLUSD is a standard ERC-20 token backed by LUSD thanks to the redemption mechanism, with a rising price floor thanks to the yield amplification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;base-yield-source&#34;&gt;Base yield source
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a protocol, Chicken Bonds collect LUSD and deploy them into two potential yield sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquity Stability Pool&lt;/strong&gt;, where LUSD can be deposited to earn LQTY as well as variable ETH liquidation premiums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curve LUSD/3CRV&lt;/strong&gt;, where LUSD can be supplied against USDC/USDT/DAI to earn trading fees as well as CRV tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with how Liquity works yet, you can get up to date with this dedicated article: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;auto-compounded&#34;&gt;Auto compounded
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of plugging into the yield sources directly, middleware solutions are used to provide various benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposits into the Liquity Stability Pool are managed using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;B.Protocol vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which handles the frequent harvesting and compounding of ETH and LQTY obtained into LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Curve Pool, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x5fA5B62c8AF877CB37031e0a3B2f34A78e3C56A6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is used to optimize the yields obtained by harnessing Convex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good: streamlined solutions to simple problems. Yet, the yield amplification, one of the biggest feats of the Chicken Bonds, is a bit trickier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;yield-amplification&#34;&gt;Yield Amplification
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how it can achieve this, we must start peeling the onion that is the internal accounting tool of the protocol: the Buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three buckets enabling the Chicken bonds to guarantee the three core features of the protocol: the option to Chicken Out (Pending), the yield amplification (Reserve), and the growth of liquidity (Permanent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/3buckets.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3buckets&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pending Bucket&lt;/strong&gt; has a simple job: it must be able to repay investors fully if they were to Chicken Out. To ensure it’s always possible, the Pending Bucket harnesses a yield source free of impermanent loss: the Stability Pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users Chicken In a bond, the corresponding LUSD balances are split between the Reserve and Permanent Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reserve Bucket backs bLUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. With redemptions, bLUSD holders can burn their tokens to obtain a pro-rata share of the LUSD contained in the Reserve Bucket —  securing a price floor for bLUSD. Funds in reserve are also producing a yield harnessing the Stability Pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the Permanent Bucket grows the liquidity of LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to its shifting function, triggerable by anyone when LUSD is overpeg, the Permanent Bucket can pull its liquidity out of the b.protocol vault to single supply the Curve LUSD/3CRV pool instead. It helps reduce the LUSD price and secures a favorable entry point in the pool since the deposit rebalances it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;yield produced by the Pending and Permanent buckets is redirected to the Reserve Bucket&lt;/strong&gt;, which creates the yield amplification and rising price floor of bLUSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bootstrap-period--next-steps&#34;&gt;Bootstrap period &amp;amp; next steps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD Chicken Bonds have been live since Tuesday, October 4, 2022. During the first two weeks of the system, until Oct 19, it’s still in the &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap period&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicken Ins are not possible, which means the supply of bLUSD is still 0. It means that all the LUSD are in the Pending Bucket, except the yield already produced that is being redirected to the Reserve Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the bootstrap period is over, the Chicken In option will be available, enabling depositors to start accessing bLUSD. To facilitate getting in and out of bLUSD, a &lt;strong&gt;bLUSD liquidity pool will be incentivized on Curve Finance, using a 3% fee paid while Chickening In&lt;/strong&gt;. It will enable the liquidity to develop progressively as the first batch of bonds reaches their break-even point (~Oct 19) and optimal rebond time (~Nov 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section will discuss the chosen liquidity structure and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chicken-bonds-impact-on-lusds-price-and-liquidity&#34;&gt;Chicken Bonds’ impact on LUSD’s price and liquidity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read me up to this point, you are now in the know regarding LUSD’s price premium and the model introduced by the Chicken Bonds. Let’s connect the dots then and consider how the LUSD Chicken Bonds will &lt;strong&gt;contribute to LUSD’s overall liquidity and help to contain its premium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds have two impacts on LUSD liquidity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the growth of the Permanent Bucket, the liquidity supplied to the LUSD/3CRV will grow as long as the LUSD price still has a premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The liquidity pool structure was chosen for bLUSD to help further grow liquidity on the LUSD/3CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short time frame, the release of LUSD Chicken Bonds lead to more demand for LUSD and an increase in its price. However, LUSD deposited into the Chicken Bonds proves beneficial to LUSD’s liquidity in the long run, as we highlight in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-engine-to-capture-liquity-over-time&#34;&gt;An engine to capture liquity over time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As deposits into the LUSD Chicken Bonds accrue, the potential impact on the LUSD peg grows. Indeed, when a user Chickens In, the underlying LUSD are distributed between the Reserve and the Permanent Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all three buckets produce yield by deploying the LUSD into the b.protocol vault. However, the Permanent Bucket also features a &lt;strong&gt;shifting function&lt;/strong&gt; triggerable by anyone as long as LUSD trades at a premium. It shifts the LUSD of the Permanent Bucket to &lt;strong&gt;provide liquidity on Curve&lt;/strong&gt; (single asset supply), helping to progressively rebalance the pool while also growing its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of the total amount of LUSD deposited into Chicken Bonds allocated to the Permanent Bucket is hard to predict, as it depends on users&amp;rsquo; behaviors. Here are some napkin maths using a conservative estimate of 10% of the total assets in the Permanent Bucket, with the 5M LUSD currently available in the LUSD/3CRV to estimate the Chicken Bonds impact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Chicken Bonds TVL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Directly Added Liquity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Added Liquity (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7M (Current)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;700K LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;10M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;40.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;50M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;5M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;100.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added liquidity percentage could be a good proxy indicator of how much of the price premium can be reduced. Keep in mind that it remains approximative, as it only considers the LUSD/3CRV main pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, with $10M TVL into the Chicken Bonds by the end of the first cycle, the impact could already be palpable with an increase of ~20% of the LUSD amount available in the Curve pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifting function is disabled for the first 45 days of the system, i.e. until November 19. After this date, anyone will be able to move the Permanent Bucket liquidity from Curve &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; B.Protocol if &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://liquity.gitbook.io/chicken-bonds/faq/lusd-peg-stability#_vowf7444yzdt&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growing-blusd-liquidity-hands-in-hand-with-lusd&#34;&gt;Growing bLUSD liquidity hands in hand with LUSD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another indirect beneficial effect of the Chicken Bonds, stemming from the chosen structure for bLUSD liquidity, incentivized by the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a &lt;strong&gt;3% Chicken In fee is collected and redirected to incentivize liquidity providers of the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool&lt;/strong&gt;. This pool is a meta pool made of bLUSD paired with the LP token of the existing LUSD/3CRV. At perfect equilibrium, the asset exposure would be: 50% bLUSD / 25% LUSD + 25% 3pool (8.33% USDC / 8.33% USDT / 8.33% DAI).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This liquidity structure ensures that &lt;strong&gt;50% of the deposits made into the bLUSD LP pool directly contribute to growing the liquidity of the main LUSD/3CRV&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, because this pool has its own incentive budget (Chicken In fee), it will provide an attractive LUSD yield to stakers on top of the base yield generated by swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Chicken Bonds mature, the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool could get its own gauge, securing additional CRV (and potentially CVX) rewards on top of the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model was chosen over a bLUSD/LUSD pool which would have required a sizeable amount of LUSD without contributing to LUSD’s liquidity against other stablecoins. The main downside of the chosen model is that it makes the deposit and withdrawal interactions more complex for liquidity providers. However, this concern will be lifted with &lt;strong&gt;zaps enabling the supply and withdrawal from LUSD and bLUSD directly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool equilibrium, supplying it single-sided with either LUSD or bLUSD can result in a premium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is too much LUSD-3CRV in the pool, providing bLUSD rebalances the pool and results in a premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is too much bLUSD in the pool, then supplying it with LUSD will result in a &lt;strong&gt;double premium&lt;/strong&gt; as both the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV and LUSD/3CRV pools are rebalanced in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-solutions-to-grow-lusds-liquidity&#34;&gt;Additional solutions to grow LUSD’s liquidity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds are the main ongoing initiatives attempting to grow LUSD’s liquidity, yet, other projects and solutions are being explored too. Here’s an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vecrv-position-and-bribes&#34;&gt;veCRV position and bribes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liquity treasury entered the Curve Wars months ago, acquiring and locking CRV tokens to support the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV gauge. To maximize the impact of the LUSD Chicken Bonds, &lt;strong&gt;a bribing campaign&lt;/strong&gt; is also synchronized with the release to increase the CRV APY of LUSD/3CRV pool depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Warden Quest, LQTY tokens are awarded to veCRV and vlCVX voters on the LUSD/3CRV CRV gauge. The bribing campaign secured &lt;strong&gt;5M veCRV votes (~1% of total votes)&lt;/strong&gt;, which led to a sharp increase in the APY, bringing it to parity with a basic Stability Pool deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you out of the loop with the Curve Wars? Start here: &lt;br&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV wars: the race to accumulate the ability to influence the Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerpools-lucy-interest-bearing-lusd-lp-position&#34;&gt;PowerPool’s LUCY: interest-bearing LUSD LP position
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PowerPool team has been working on an interesting &lt;strong&gt;novel type of Balancer pool&lt;/strong&gt; suited for LUSD, and it’s now close to being released: the LUSD-a-bb-USD pool, also known under the sweet name of &lt;strong&gt;LUCY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Chicken Bonds, this pool &lt;strong&gt;harnesses b.protocol to provide an auto-compounded earning opportunity on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the main innovation of this pool is to involve interest-bearing assets and constantly &lt;strong&gt;rebalances between yield-bearing and liquidity-providing activities&lt;/strong&gt;. The pool is made of two wrapper tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-balancer-boosted-aave-usd&#34;&gt;1/ Balancer Boosted Aave USD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pool is essentially the &lt;strong&gt;Balancer’s equivalent of Curve’s 3 pool&lt;/strong&gt;, the main stablecoin pool of the decentralized exchange. The key difference here is that the pool involves &lt;strong&gt;interest-bearing wrappers&lt;/strong&gt; of each stablecoin. Depending on the pool’s liquidity needs, each stablecoin rebalances between liquidity-providing or yield-bearing through Aave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/bbaUSD-pool-composition.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bbaUSD-pool-composition&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-lusd--bprotocol&#34;&gt;2/ LUSD + b.protocol
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bb-a-USD tokens are paired against LUSD, which also &lt;strong&gt;rebalances yield-bearing (Stability Pool with b.protocol) and liquidity-providing&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the LUCY pool should be interesting to grow LUSD’s available liquidity, as it could provide an interest yield-stacking option for liquity providers, earning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;swap fees APR&lt;/strong&gt;, collected on exchanges involving the pool’s tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;base yield&lt;/strong&gt; on each pool token (Aave’s yield for USDC/USDT/DAI, Stability Pool’s yields for LUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[If a BAL gauge is obtained] the &lt;strong&gt;LP token BAL staking APY&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be further increased with gauge votes and bribing campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel pool will mark the arrival of LUSD on Balancer, diversifying its liquidity source further, as the main venues to trade LUSD are currently Curve, Uniswap, and Velodrome on Optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-integrations-into-other-lending-protocols&#34;&gt;LUSD integrations into other lending protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, LUSD has been increasingly integrated across various DeFi protocols, providing &lt;strong&gt;additional options to LUSD holders and arbitrageurs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0&amp;amp;marketName=proto_mainnet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;addition of LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave&lt;/a&gt; marked the first time the stablecoin could be borrowed using collateral other than ETH to secure the position. As the liquidity available on the market grows, it opens LUSD arbitrage to non-ETH holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/lusd-aave-market.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;lusd-aave-market&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;LUSD was also added as collateral on two €-based lending protocols&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://angle.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Angle Money&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mimo.capital/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mimo&lt;/a&gt;. Both enable LUSD holders to enter a short position on €, using their LUSD as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gearbox.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GearBox&lt;/a&gt; is gearing up to release its V2 shortly, enabling users to get leverage according to a pre-determined and smart-contract-enforced set of rules. Amongst the options available at release, &lt;strong&gt;liquidity providers of the LUSD/3CRV will be able to leverage their position&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing the lending market of LUSD beyond Liquity grows the stablecoin utility while enabling more various types of users to arbitrage its price fluctuations. Paired with the ongoing efforts to grow LUSD’s liquidity on DEX, it will help stabilize its price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-on-optimism-velodrome-and-stargate&#34;&gt;LUSD on Optimism: Velodrome and Stargate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD also &lt;strong&gt;has a strong presence on Optimism&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to Liquity being one of the protocols involved in the Velodrome races. With a respectable veVELO position, Liquity has been able to grow several LUSD-related pools to sizeable TVL. Moreover, pools on Velodrome tend to be more balanced than the mainnet pools:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;lusd-velodrome&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, bridging LUSD to Optimism is currently a bit of a one-way trip. Bridging LUSD to Optimism is easy and only takes 5-10 min using the official bridge. However bridging back to the mainnet takes 7 days with the official bridge, and no alternative options with decent liquidity are available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is about to change, enabling LUSD’s strong liquidity on Optimism to positively impact the mainnet situation: Stargate, the omnichain liquidity transport protocol, recently voted to &lt;strong&gt;add support for LUSD&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xe6fef4aa9c8e9d162f694ab764b11c06918b9f199aafe43e0d85b12d8271011c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SIP#16&lt;/a&gt;), which will enable its fast bridging from and to Optimism once implemented. If Stargate can provide a reliable solution to fast bridge LUSD from Optimism to mainnet, it could positively impact mainnet’s LUSD liquidity pools balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, Liquity is the only &amp;ldquo;deployer.&amp;rdquo; This concept will gain relevance with the Generalized version of the Chicken Bonds, where other protocols can harness the model to benefit their tokens.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity driver tokens enable direct incentives to selected liquidity or lending pairs, usually through a locking system. They allow projects which lock them to direct emissions to pools of their choosing to attract liquidity.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Aave&#39;s GHO stablecoin help the protocol further grow and overtake MakerDAO and DAI?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/aave-gho-stablecoin/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/aave-gho-stablecoin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/aave-gho-stablecoin/aave-gho-stablecoin-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Can Aave&#39;s GHO stablecoin help the protocol further grow and overtake MakerDAO and DAI?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the concept for the GHO stablecoin was introduced on the Aave Governance Forum and triggered a wave of excitement across DeFi. Indeed, the idea of a decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin, pegged to USD and native to the Aave DAO makes a lot of sense as a next step for the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the design introduced before considering how the Aave DAO and team could bring it to market and turn it into a stablecoin potentially as significant as DAI. Of course, the information is still scarce, so the second part of the article will be primarily extrapolations stemming from my DeFi experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-gho-aaves-native-stablecoin&#34;&gt;Introduction to GHO, Aave&amp;rsquo;s native stablecoin
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its early days, one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s main challenges has been attracting sufficient stablecoin deposits since it&amp;rsquo;s a preferred choice for most borrowers. Thus, creating a stablecoin native to the DAO is a natural next step and should also allow lowering costs for borrowers. Since this stablecoin is minted, there is no need to pay the APR of the depositors on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the main characteristics of GHO as presented on the governance forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-overcollateralized-usd-pegged-stablecoin&#34;&gt;An overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO will be an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted using aTokens as collateral. So in a sense, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to MakerDAO but slightly more efficient since all collateral will be productive assets generating some interest (aTokens) – depending on their borrowing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the naming, it&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see Aave not including &amp;ldquo;USD&amp;rdquo; in the name. Considering how aggressive the US regulators can be, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a net benefit from a legal perspective. Still, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the only driver of the decision, as Aave&amp;rsquo;s founder Stani hinted at a potential peg swap further down the line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to a currency has limitations over long term, potentially you might want to swap the peg from one underlying asset to another (for various reasons) or track something else and being bound to a USD in the ticker would be a limiting factor. On top of that everyone is doing that already which makes it a bit repetitive and restrictive from the messaging perspective. DAI follows the same path actually and has been helpful to build a narrative over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stani on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-gho/8730/27&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&amp;rsquo;s GHO introduction post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interest-model-and-stkaave-discount&#34;&gt;Interest model and stkAAVE discount
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interest rate model for GHO is currently its most underwhelming component, as the initial post envisioned an interest rate directly determined by the Aave DAO, just like how it works on Maker. However, that would be inefficient and add unnecessary bloat to the governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community feedback will dictate where it goes. Still, I genuinely hope for Aave that the final call lands on a model where the interest rate is algorithmically determined by market conditions, just like with other tokens on Aave where the supply/demand on the pool dictates the interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Aave community feels like it is a necessity to involve the DAO in determining the interest rate — an absurdity in my book since a DAO is absolutely unfit to manage the operational parameters of a system — then a hybrid model could be envisioned with a fixed base rate voted on by the DAO, and modulated within a range depending on the market condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, having the interest rate evolve dynamically can help protect GHO&amp;rsquo;s peg by deterring against massive minting events, just like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/lusd-redemptions#how-is-the-baserate-calculated&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how the baseRate works on Liquity&lt;/a&gt; to protect LUSD from de-pegging downward. Initially, at 0.5%, the fee rises when demand surges to progressively decays back to 0.5% as the demand stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post also mentions a discount for GHO borrowers staking AAVE tokens, creating further synergies. Finally, 100% of the interest rates paid by depositors will go to the Aave DAO (vs. a Reserve Factor in the ~10% range for most other tokens), meaning that if GHO grows to a significant market cap, it could turn into a goldmine for the DAO. &lt;strong&gt;With a market cap similar&amp;rsquo;s to DAI, and an average interest rate of 3.5% (high-end), AaveDAO would earn close to $150K daily from GHO&amp;rsquo;s interest rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick napkin maths with different GHO market cap and interest rate assumptions to give you an idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GHO Marketcap: 1.5B = FRAX&amp;rsquo;s current supply, 6.6B is DAI&amp;rsquo;s, and 52B is USDC — one can dream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GHO Average Interest Rate: 1% would be highly competitive, 3.5% in the higher-end of the usual rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilitators-and-rwa&#34;&gt;Facilitators and RWA
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO&amp;rsquo;s design envisions &amp;ldquo;Facilitators,&amp;rdquo; onboarded by Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance, that would be able to mint GHO. The first facilitator would be the Aave protocol itself, but others will follow suit, be they protocols or entities. This part is exciting, as it widely opens up GHO&amp;rsquo;s design space. Following the release, we could see other protocols applying to become facilitators and building on top of Aave and GHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/aave-gho-stablecoin/gho-facilitators.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gho-facilitators&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also explicit mentions of undercollateralized positions based on credentials such as a credit score. Each facilitator will have a maximal GHO minting capacity determined by the DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-and-absence-of-censorship-resistance&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Decentralization&amp;rdquo; and absence of censorship resistance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO is presented as a decentralized stablecoin by the Aave team, with even some mentions of censorship resistance. However, it&amp;rsquo;s never directly associated with GHO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of stablecoins will only continue to grow as cryptoassets become further integrated with a user base that is less crypto-native. Decentralized stablecoins provide censorship-resistant fiat-denominated currency on the blockchain. Introducing, GHO, a decentralized multi-collateral stablecoin that is fully backed and native to the Aave Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I&amp;rsquo;ve misunderstood the design, GHO will be &lt;strong&gt;as &amp;ldquo;decentralized&amp;rdquo; as DAI and have weak censorship resistance&lt;/strong&gt; because of its collateral composition. Indeed, assuming that all aTokens that can be currently used as collateral to borrow on Aave will also be used to borrow GHO, GHO&amp;rsquo;s collateral composition will be mostly made of censorable tokens such as USDC:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;DeFiLlama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed excluding stETH used as collateral to leverage the ETH staking yield (borrowing ETH), USDC is the top collateral used on Aave, with another trusted token (wBTC) not far behind. &lt;strong&gt;Still, the collateral composition would be much better than DAI,&lt;/strong&gt; which is &amp;gt;50% backed by pure USDC.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;dai-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ~25% of the backing comes from other trust-required collateral or reflexive liquity providing positions (such as DAI/USDC LP used as collateral to mint DAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the envisioned design for GHO, feel free to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-gho/8730&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the governance forum post&lt;/a&gt; and the replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gho-to-market-what-could-aave-with-gho-look-like&#34;&gt;GHO to market: What could Aave with GHO look like?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the stage is set regarding GHO, we can move into a more speculative territory and consider how the GHO release could unfold in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the interaction between the Aave protocol and GHO is quite exciting to consider: while the initial post mention Aave x GHO, as well as the enablement of the eMode (enabling significant leverage on selected pairs such as USDC/DAI) on GHO, it quite scarce in details, so let me share instead how I envision it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aGHO would be fascinating collateral on Aave, but it could also create significant reflexive risks if allowed to borrow GHO. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;I expect aGHO to be blocked from minting GHO&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent reflexive backing like we&amp;rsquo;re currently seeing on DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it would allow for exciting stablecoin arbitrage loops, such as aUSDC &amp;gt; Mint GHO &amp;gt; aGHO &amp;gt; Borrow another stablecoin. With the eMode, this would make Aave &amp;amp; GHO a very effective protocol for stablecoin arbitrage. Besides, the GHO interest rate would become a kind of &amp;ldquo;base stablecoin interest rate&amp;rdquo; and maybe help keep the interest rate of other stablecoins like USDC in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ghos-liquidity-strategy&#34;&gt;GHO&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical and essential part of any stablecoin&amp;rsquo;s design is its liquidity strategy. Since CRV, CVX, and BAL are accepted as collateral on Aave, there could be exciting things done with the CRV, CVX, and BAL accumulated by the treasury, thanks to the Reserve Factor. Locking them into their native protocols would enable the Aave DAO to direct incentives to GHO-related pools.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Aave’s Treasury Report&lt;/a&gt; (July 2022)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Frax is currently pivoting away from USDT and DAI and trying to establish the Frax Basepool (FRAX/USDC) as a pairing currency on Curve for other stablecoins, we could envision a similar move from Aave. Moreover, many projects currently exposed to USDC and DAI are looking to diversify their liquidity away from them. GHO might arrive with perfect timing to enable DeFi to be less reliant on USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while Frax controls sizeable governance and gauge-voting power in the Curve Wars, this is not the case for the Aave DAO. Current treasury CRV/CVX balances will clearly be insufficient to incentivize pools to grow into the billion dollar range, so it could drive the AaveDAO to look into acquiring more liquidity-incentive-driver tokens. With the significant revenues that the DAO will collect from GHO&amp;rsquo;s interest rate, it should have sufficient means to support appropriate liquidity, whatever GHO&amp;rsquo;s market cap ends up being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Aave has been historically close to Balancer, with the 80% AAVE / 20% wETH Balancer Pool used in the Safety Module since the transition to the AAVE token. The treasury currently owns 200k BAL and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;another acquisition is planned&lt;/a&gt;. Thus we could expect an exciting play for GHO on Balancer. Yet when it comes to stablecoin, Curve remains both the king and king-maker: I don&amp;rsquo;t see how Aave could sufficiently grow GHO&amp;rsquo;s liquidity without getting involved one way or another in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the CRV wars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the base protocol incentives (such as the dynamic or DAO-governed borrowing interest rate) and liquidation mechanism, the liquidity strategy is probably one of the most crucial element for a stablecoin since it also has an impact on how well the peg is held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand what is at stake in the stablecoin wars. The end of the year will be interesting, with the GHO release approaching and Curve&amp;rsquo;s stablecoin, also overcollateralized, which was hinted to release before the end of this year. The multiplication of stablecoin is a natural next step for DeFi, as most established protocols see their design converge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frax started as a stablecoin only, now has FraxSwap and soon FraxLend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave started as a money market, soon with its own native stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve started as a DEX, but the addition of its own stablecoin soon could enable efficient borrowing for liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, as shown with my napkin maths earlier, the main reason for a protocol to create its stablecoin is quite apparent: it&amp;rsquo;s where there is the most money to be made, as well as massive demand and product/market fit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Behind the scene of the decentralization theater: a study of the inalterability of DeFi protocols</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/unstoppable-defi/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/unstoppable-defi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/unstoppable-defi-tokenbrice-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Behind the scene of the decentralization theater: a study of the inalterability of DeFi protocols" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance has allowed the emergence of autonomous protocols whose functionalities are ensured by smart contracts that are sometimes immutable. It enables individuals from all over the world to use financial services that are at the same time sovereign, accessible, and more efficient and resilient than those available in traditional finance. It&amp;rsquo;s the lovely story that newcomers are told to lull them to sleep: the reality is much more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;a handful of protocols fit this reality,&lt;/strong&gt; but most are far from being up to par. When the bulls are out, interest in the resilience of the protocols is generally shallow: the only thing that matters is price appreciation. But the bears have made a comeback, and thankfully it means a renewed interest in these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent implosion of the Luna ecosystem and its associated stablecoin, UST, will hopefully serve as a wake-up call for some. It was, unfortunately, a &lt;strong&gt;perfectly avoidable&lt;/strong&gt; disaster. The model used for this stablecoin and its flaws were already known, with many previous instances covered on this blog: BAC, MIC, ESD, DSD, etc. (at the application level on Ethereum rather than the protocol level, but with the same fundamental problems). They all had the same end: an endless spiral that brought them closer to absolute 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of this event, many investors have become aware that not all stablecoins are created equal and seek to learn more about the resilience of the many stablecoins available on the market and the robustness of different DeFi protocols in general. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m seizing this exceptional moment to discuss this essential topic for the sustainability of DeFi; it has been a passion of mine for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, last year I already proposed to you an exhaustive analysis of the risks incurred on the borrowing services in DeFi and how to evaluate them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is still relevant and a highly recommended read for any informed investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the introduction. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the point and define the term &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo; and what it implies in concrete terms at a protocol level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-unstoppable-defi-protocol&#34;&gt;What is an unstoppable DeFi protocol?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, we can call &lt;strong&gt;a DeFi protocol unstoppable &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when its essential functions are provided by smart contracts that are not modifiable, and it does not require external intervention to subsist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this relatively straightforward definition, I must add many notes and clarifications to cover the diversity of DeFi protocols and their use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-third-party-protocol-dependencies&#34;&gt;⚠️ Third-party protocol dependencies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, it is infrequent that a protocol does everything by itself. More often than not, a given protocol relies on various third-party protocols. Of course, the most common and well-known case is the oracle - the source of prices for assets - a critical component for borrowing services in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dependence-on-oracles-like-chainlink&#34;&gt;Dependence on oracles like ChainLink
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the most widely used oracle is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ChainLink&lt;/a&gt;. Although technically robust, the industry recently got a reminder, thanks to Chris Blec and a few other actors concerned about the resilience of the service: ChainLink&amp;rsquo;s oracles are susceptible to manipulation or censorship. The riskiest attack vector seems to be &lt;strong&gt;the 3/20 multisig&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows the price source for a given asset to be changed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, if three people synchronize among these 20, they could change the ETH/USD oracle, for example, for an in-house oracle that returns a price of $1, and almost all DeFi loans would be liquidated in the process. However, it seems rather unlikely that people on or close to the ChainLink team would carry out such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant risk seems to be an &lt;strong&gt;attack by an external actor&lt;/strong&gt; who would like to harm the whole of DeFi. Indeed, with such a permissive multisig, it would be &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; to identify three or more members of this multisig, kidnap them and threaten them to change a price source of ChainLink. It is the famous &amp;ldquo;🔧 wrench attack.&amp;rdquo; No matter how secure the smart contracts are, if they are administered by a multisig, they are vulnerable to this type of attack that goes through the people behind the protocols rather than the code directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is not the existence of this multisig, which is necessary to update and improve the services that ChainLink provides, but its setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/20 is extraordinarily permissive&lt;/strong&gt; and riskier from a 🔧 wrench attack point of view than 3/6, for example (which would have fewer potential targets to perform the attack). A more reasonable number aligned with what is usually done for 20 signers in total would be something between 8 and 12 signers required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No timelock&lt;/strong&gt;: so changes are immediate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚠️ Update - May 27&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 23rd (5 days after the publication of this article), the Multisig setup has been updated to a 4/9, which makes a 🔧 wrench attack harder to perform; there is still no timelock&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dependence-on-other-protocols-that-are-less-resilient-than-the-base-protocol&#34;&gt;Dependence on other protocols that are less resilient than the base protocol
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating elements in DeFi is &lt;strong&gt;composability&lt;/strong&gt;: protocols integrate and use each other. While this allows for the emergence of synergies and innovative use cases, it also comes with additional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, as we will come back to it later, we will take as an example PoolTogether, one of the most resilient protocols of the DeFi and quasi-unstoppable. The quasi comes from its external dependencies and, more precisely, the sources of yields used: Compound or Aave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the smart contracts of PoolTogether are immutable except for the part that manages the price allocation (v4). Still, the funds are deployed in protocols powered by smart contracts that can be altered (such as adding a new collateral, a necessary feature but also a potential attack vector&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general rule is that a protocol is as resilient as the weakest link in its composability chain&lt;/strong&gt;. This rule is not absolute, as it is still possible to mitigate or contain the exposure taken with integrations, for example, by implementing redundancy, as we will see below in the detailed assesments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-access-to-protocols-the-question-of-websites-front-end&#34;&gt;⚠️ Access to protocols: the question of websites (front-end)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this topic, there are two key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the access point to the protocol (= the website/front-end) resilient / can it be censored, for example, by a state actor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the site secure? Can a malicious actor attack it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;risk-of-censorship-of-the-front-end&#34;&gt;Risk of censorship of the front-end
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, I must start by reminding you of a fundamental point: a DeFi service exists thanks to a set of smart contracts. It is &lt;strong&gt;entirely possible to interact with any DeFi service by going directly through the contracts&lt;/strong&gt; - and thus, even if their site were to be inaccessible. Of course, not all DeFi users have the technical skills required to interact with smart contracts directly, which is why &lt;strong&gt;the front-end issue remains essential&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, protocols that maximize their resilience need to think about it. Two main approaches are possible and can be combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a protocol can have &lt;strong&gt;multiple access points&lt;/strong&gt; that allow access to its service: if one of them were inaccessible, others would remain online, thus causing only minor inconvenience to the service users. For example, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt; can be used through the main app.aave.com site, but also through tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://instadapp.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;InstaDapp&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, most of these sites are still hosted by &lt;strong&gt;centralized services&lt;/strong&gt; that could all be censored simultaneously: it&amp;rsquo;s more work, but it&amp;rsquo;s technically possible. To overcome this limitation, another option is available: having one or more &lt;strong&gt;sites hosted via a decentralized solution like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ipfs.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in terms of front-end resilience, the most original, elegant, and efficient approach deployed to date is probably the one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; protocol. Indeed, Liquity does not have an official website for its application deployed and managed directly by the team. Instead, the team provides &lt;strong&gt;a kit to deploy a front-end&lt;/strong&gt; of Liquity, usable by all. Because of this approach, the project now has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/frontend&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a myriad of different sites to use its service&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are hosted on IPFS:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;security-risks-of-front-end&#34;&gt;Security risks of front-end
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, one should not forget that a front-end remains a website. Even if it is not censored, &lt;strong&gt;it may be susceptible to attacks&lt;/strong&gt; of varying degrees of severity: the websites of the decentralized exchange SpiritSwap and QuickSwap, for example, have recently &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX/status/1525306033400188928?s=20&amp;amp;t=UKpcM2Gu6nZ9Kgl65kmp3w&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;suffered from such a scenario&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack vector is linked to the service&amp;rsquo;s domain name manager (GoDaddy). Other types of attacks are possible: for example, code injections through a third-party service that the site integrates, as we recently saw on EtherScan, as an advertising tracker they use was compromised (CoinZilla).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ℹ-limitations-of-unstoppable-protocols&#34;&gt;ℹ️ Limitations of unstoppable protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unstoppable protocols cannot cover all use cases. Indeed, depending on the complexity of a protocol, it is sometimes impossible to avoid any dependency on another protocol that is itself at least partially censurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one must keep in mind the counterpart that comes with the immutability of the smart contracts of unstoppable protocols: &lt;strong&gt;an update of these is technically impossible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when an unstoppable protocol needs to evolve, there is only one possible path: deploy a new version of the protocol (with its new set of immutable contracts) and encourage the &lt;strong&gt;migration&lt;/strong&gt; of its users to it. This is, for example, what Uniswap has done twice, with the migration to version 2 in May 2020 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and then again one year later with the release of Uniswap v3 in May 2021 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;UNIv2-migration-tool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the differences between the versions, the protocol may also offer a tool to facilitate migration, as was the case for UNIv1⇒UNIv2. However, it was impossible for UNIv2⇒UNIv3 mainly because of the introduction of liquidity concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-spectrum-of-resilience&#34;&gt;The Spectrum of Resilience
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve established the definition of &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo; with all the necessary precisions, I propose to move directly to the analysis. Before digging into the relevant protocols, let me offer you a spectrum that highlights different levels of resilience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/resilience-spectrum-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-spectrum-resilience-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing centralized or &amp;ldquo;DINO&amp;rdquo; (Decentralized in Name Only) protocols, decentralized in name only, is not very insightful, so I will let you dig for yourself. Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s look at protocols on the more exciting end of the spectrum: to the right of MakerDAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-the-most-resilient-dex&#34;&gt;Analysis of the most resilient DEX
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the resilience of Uniswap and Curve, we need to recall a few crucial things about decentralized exchanges. Specifically, they have two types of users who assume pretty different levels of risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users who exchange tokens through the DEX. These users bear the risks linked to the DEX smart contracts for the time of the swap only (as well as those related to unlimited &amp;ldquo;approve&amp;rdquo; if the DEX contract is compromised and is not immutable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity providers are exposed as long as their position is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Uniswap as on Curve, &lt;strong&gt;the contracts relating to the two situations are immutable&lt;/strong&gt;. It is technically impossible to envisage a &amp;ldquo;rug&amp;rdquo; of the liquidity providers, which is not the case for all DEXs: such an attack was possible on SushiSwap once because of their migration function. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that DEXs relying on an Automated Market Maker such as Uniswap or Curve do &lt;strong&gt;not need an oracle to work&lt;/strong&gt;, which significantly reduces their dependency on potentially censorable third-party services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if the contracts are immutable, the risk is not zero for the liquidity providers who assume all the risks related to the tokens involved in the pair. The general rule here is similar to that of the composability chain: &lt;strong&gt;a given LP position is as risky as its most dangerous token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front-end issue for DEX is less critical since many access points exist. The most competent users go through a decentralized exchange aggregator, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;uniswap&#34;&gt;Uniswap
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contracts core functions are completely immutable on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://uniswap.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&lt;/a&gt; v1, v2 and v3. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V2&lt;/a&gt; release markededthe introduction of an administrative fee the governance can decided to turn on&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (= to the protocol), as already seen on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the case is straightforward. If there is indeed a governance, the good news (less for UNI holders) is that what it can do is very limited. &lt;strong&gt;No seizure or migration of funds is possible&lt;/strong&gt;. Apart from the fee, it manages matters such as deploying Uniswap on a new chain, adding a new tier of fees (1bps for stablecoins), or using the protocol&amp;rsquo;s treasury &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, to fund liquidity mining campaigns or to distribute UNI to friendly people who ask for it, without any limit or accounting &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curve-finance&#34;&gt;Curve Finance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve Finance&lt;/a&gt; is another example of resilient DEX with an equally exciting approach. Again, the essential functions are provided by immutable contracts. Nevertheless, Curve also has an &amp;ldquo;Emergency DAO&amp;rdquo; whose members are elected by the governance. This Emergency DAO can &amp;ldquo;kill&amp;rdquo; a pool (only if pools that are younger than 2 months old and not factory pools): all functions except withdrawal are disabled. It prevents further loss of funds if a problem emerges with Curve&amp;rsquo;s contracts. The Emergency DAO can also kill a gauge - that is the reward contract handling CRV (and potentially other token) rewards. Killed gauges can then be resurrected by the main DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Uniswap, Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance is centered around the management of CRV token issuance and management. However, the model is much more refined here; I invite you to read my previous articles on the subject to better understand it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;⚔ Advanced CRV Wars: Analysis of Protocols Built on Curve and Convex &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Uniswap, participation in Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance requires locking CRV tokens ( ⇒veCRV) for up to four years for those who want to maximize their influence. Thus, it protects the governance from different types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the governance also manages a whitelist of smart contracts authorized to interact with the veCRV contract &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: such decisions are consequential for liquidity providers on Curve and CRV owners in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance is one of the most fascinating to follow in DeFi. To help it make more informed decisions, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://substack.com/profile/66151946-crypto-risk-assessments&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a newsletter offering risk assesments of the various protocols that require a gauge&lt;/a&gt; has been set up. I highly recommend reading it; it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent source for perfecting one&amp;rsquo;s understanding of risk in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-depth-analysis-of-other-notable-protocols&#34;&gt;In-depth analysis of other notable protocols
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to decentralized exchanges, other types of protocols get as close as possible to the most resilient end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, the use cases of the protocols we will detail now are more complex and cannot be served, to my knowledge, without dependencies on other more or less censorable services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity&#34;&gt;Liquity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is a dogged project that aims to create the most resilient borrowing system and stablecoin while maintaining an economically efficient system for borrowers. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail about this protocol here, I invite you to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the points relevant to our topic of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquity&amp;rsquo;s code is entirely immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquity has no governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, like any borrowing service, Liquity depends on an oracle (ETH price in USD). Here, ChainLink is used, but a backup system is also in place. Calculations are made to determine if the data provided by ChainLink is deemed reliable. If it is not, the system automatically switches to a secondary price source as long as it is needed: the Tellor oracle. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, as I mentioned above, Liquity also has an interesting approach to maximizing front-end decentralization.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this approach, Liquity is the most resilient borrowing protocol available on Ethereum, allowing LUSD to sweep the title of the most robust and decentralized stablecoin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pooltogether&#34;&gt;PoolTogether
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating protocol that explores a new concept: &amp;ldquo;no-loss&amp;rdquo;. Concretely, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/pool-together-v5/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is a prize-linked savings account where the player takes no financial risk on his principal: the game relies entirely on the yield produced by the principal. It redistributes it to the different players according to their luck at the draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/pooltogether.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pooltogether&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this protocol, I invite you once again to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pool-together.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the resilience of the protocol. Here, the main issue is &lt;strong&gt;the initial source of yield, which is external&lt;/strong&gt;: it comes from services like Aave or Compound, which are not unstoppable. Thus, a PoolTogether player assumes this risk on his entire deposit: the principal and the yield generated (before it is collected and redirected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this third-party dependency, the PoolTogetger protocol is remarkably resilient. Indeed, on the PoolTogether side, &lt;strong&gt;contracts are as immutable as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, they are all immutable (so a given pool cannot change its source of yield), except for the prize distribution part, which only affects the yields generated. Indeed, the prize distribution model can change following a governance vote (mainnet) or a multisig operation (Avalanche/Polygon), which is necessary because cross-chain governance is not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is fascinating and unique in DeFi: PoolTogether is a no-loss prize-linked savings account. This (financial) design principle also manifests itself in smart contracts. A player cannot lose his principal, excluding a problem with Aave/Compound or a critical bug in the PoolTogether contracts. The code itself guarantees this; only the return is potentially at risk. Even if the entire PoolTogether team suffers a 🔧 wrench attack or PoolTogether&amp;rsquo;s governance turns hostile. So &lt;strong&gt;the promise of no loss is upheld at the smart-contract level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also nuances and differences between V3 and V4 of the protocol as far as risks are concerned. The best thing is to carefully read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.pooltogether.com/security/risks&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trustlessfi-&#34;&gt;TrustlessFi 🏗️
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://trustless.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Trustless&lt;/a&gt; is a protocol that I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with lately. It&amp;rsquo;s not live yet, but I think the approach has a lot of merits. To describe it very simply, &lt;strong&gt;TrustlessFi is like Liquity and Reflexer having a child together on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the goal is, as with Liquity, to create a protocol that will eventually be as unstoppable as possible, and the associated stablecoin (HUE) will inherit this property. Other mechanisms are similar to Liquity, such as ETH as the only collateral, immediate liquidations, or decentralization of the front-end (with a community validation mechanism this time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the governance side, we have here an approach similar to the Reflexer/RAI de-governance plan but more engaging: 4 phases are envisaged, and at each stage, the control of the Foundation and the community decreases making the protocol more and more immutable. These &lt;strong&gt;phases will be implemented in the code of the contracts themselves&lt;/strong&gt;: it is possible to delay the transition to a new phase by 45 days up to three times if necessary, but it is impossible to cancel this transition altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanism similar to Maker-MCD&amp;rsquo;s Dai Saving Rate allows participation in the system without necessarily needing to generate debt. HUE owners will be able to stake it to get a return from the interest rates paid by the borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are also some fascinating new features, such as that Troves/CDPs will be tokenized as NFTs, allowing their transfer. Another example is the deployment of HUE liquidity in Uniswap v3 (HUE/ETH), managed by the protocol. At the oracle level, we would also have an unstoppable price source using Uniswap v3, but this undoubtedly comes with increased manipulation risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the approach is going in the right direction. Still, there are many new concepts in this protocol, so it is not easy to anticipate the result once it is available in production for the time being &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-last-clarifications&#34;&gt;Conclusion and last clarifications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that this definite article can serve as a reference for all those who have essential questions about the resilience of DeFi protocols. As usual, rather than delivering assesments as is, I have tried to detail as much as possible the methodology and reasoning so that you can study for yourself the resilience of any protocol not mentioned in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go deeper, I warmly invite you to read an article I published last year, which perfectly complements this one, focused on money markets. It proposes a method of analysis to evaluate the different potential risks they imply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that such a precise analysis of such a critical subject could arouse more or less positive emotions. Please know that, as always, my intention is only &lt;strong&gt;to inform as many DeFians as possible on matters that I consider essential for DeFi in general.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My educational and pedagogical actions in DeFi have no other purpose than maximizing the resilience and relevance of decentralized finance over the long term. I hope that developers or promoters of protocols to the left of my suggested resilience spectrum will also understand and recognize this mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention throughout this article the unstoppability of some DeFi protocols: we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the immutability of smart contract code here. The order of transactions on Ethereum can still be manipulated (⇒ MEV), and miners keep an essential role (until the transition to PoS). The contractual unstoppability discussed in this article thus has infrastructural limits.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Announcement: Joining Liquity to bolster the growth of unstoppable DeFi</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/joining-liquity/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/joining-liquity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/tokenbrice-liquity/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcement: Joining Liquity to bolster the growth of unstoppable DeFi" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little less involved in the DeFi discussion lately  and you might righfully wonder why. First, I needed to slow down and take some time for myself, and the timing could not be better. While I was off, I had the time to reflect on what drew me to DeFi in the first place and how the space has evolved since I started getting involved about four years ago. Watching protocols with massive design flaws blowing up is reassuring, especially to those who anticipated it, but not exactly what I dreamed of when I discovered DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;has-defi-lost-its-way&#34;&gt;Has DeFi lost its way?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems like we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our ways. TradFi turned into the non-sensical monster we know not on purpose nor by design: it was simply the result of every person and entity trying to pull the blanket to themselves: &lt;strong&gt;an accumulation of individual&amp;rsquo;s greed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments during this last year in DeFi felt very similar to TradFi&amp;rsquo;s avarice: in terms of building a resilient and self-sovereign financial system for all, close to nothing was achieved. Instead, most of the releases were focused on delivering yet another flavor of ponzinomics to sustain the greed of apes for a few weeks until they move to the next shiny farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that what &lt;strong&gt;we need in the end-game are systems able to resist the (potentially coordinated) attacks of states, organized crime, and whales&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the current protocols available in DeFi would not stand a day against structured attacks of significant magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large share of &amp;ldquo;DeFi&amp;rdquo; protocols are vulnerable to the good old wrench attack because of their reliance on multisigs: identifying, locating and threatening a dozen individuals is not an arduous task, especially when billions are at stake. Economic attacks can also seriously affect another significant share of DeFi protocols, especially if perpetrated by an actor willing to burn money in the process. Finally, governance attacks are so commonplace it&amp;rsquo;s not even exciting to cover them anymore. It is not the DeFi I signed up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built a platform and shed light on the projects that brought something new and relevant to the table during the last few years. Complimentary to my analysis and commentaries, I&amp;rsquo;ve supported several projects, shared my insights with creative and sensible teams, and sometimes been involved in the governance processes. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt ready to assume a more active role within the ecosystem: today is the day! I&amp;rsquo;m confident my honest, sometimes brutal, yet always informed approach was and still is something lacking in the industry where shills are king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;announcing-tokenbrice-x-liquity&#34;&gt;Announcing: TokenBrice x Liquity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; as Head of Marketing to support the growth of protocol, mainly focusing on a yet-to-be-announced project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Liquity protocol is just over a year old, the team has already been active and building for much longer. What has been achieved is truly unique, remarkable, and needed. Liquity is the &lt;strong&gt;first and still only lending service available in DeFi that is  unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What always amazed me is that this feat is delivered without compromising on the protocol&amp;rsquo;s efficiency: Liquity is extremely cost-efficient, and the protocol&amp;rsquo;s design is one of rare elegance. Liquity is &lt;strong&gt;built like mission-critical software&lt;/strong&gt;: failure is not an option. I&amp;rsquo;m glad such a protocol, truthful to the root spirit of DeFi, exists, and I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to get the chance to help it grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar yet with what Liquity does and why it matters, feel free this intro:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-will-i-do&#34;&gt;What will I do?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Liquity, I&amp;rsquo;ll spearhead the growth efforts through all relevant channels: documentation, content strategy, media, events, and more, without forgetting, of course, to fuel the memetic. While I&amp;rsquo;ll mostly focus on an upcoming and yet to be announced product, I&amp;rsquo;ll also support the existing one in all relevant ways. With my efforts to craft and grow Liquity&amp;rsquo;s narrative, the community&amp;rsquo;s support, I&amp;rsquo;m confident Liquity&amp;rsquo;s prime time is yet to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still entirely convinced that great things are built from the bottom-up: I&amp;rsquo;ll be in close touch with the Liquity&amp;rsquo;s community to incorporate its insights and feedback at every possible level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m excited by the mission, my latest time-off taught me a lot about work/life balance: therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep my involvement with Liquity part-time. It lets me make sure I still have the time for a healthy personal life and hobbies, including DeFi, such as conducting my research and sharing them with you on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my live shows on Twitch, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to the weekly rhythm I used to have, but I&amp;rsquo;m not excluding some occasional shows to discuss relevant protocols and topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled for this next step of my journey and eager to share more with you regarding what is coming next for unstoppable DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤗 Thanks to all my readers and listeners for your support so far. I have several upcoming blog posts with unique insights to share with you in the coming months, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex </title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/curve-wars-l2-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game and the fight around CRV and CVX tokens have changed in scope since my last article describing the original Curve Wars, now almost primitive. The infrastructure around Curve has become much denser with the arrival of Convex of course, but also Votium, Union Llama Airforce, Concentrator, CCRV, Lendflare, Warden, and many other protocols still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume a strategic position on CRV or CVX, one must now be able to support an investment of several tens of millions of dollars. Thus, the race to accumulate CVX and CRV has become primarily a game for DAOs or whales. More specifically, DAOs seem to prefer CVX to CRV, which represents a more favorable trade-off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosts LP Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: ability to build liquidity via votes on Curve gauges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yields&lt;/strong&gt;: 4-5% in cvxCRV + potential bribe yields if capacity is not used (or the protocol also use bribes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;: CVX can be used to its maximum capacity by committing 16 weeks + 3 days (vlCVX) while CRV requires up to 4 years of commitment (1 CRV = veCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to extract the utility of CRV, CVX is a credible and more flexible alternative, which is why most DAOs focus on this token. Convex Finance has become a &amp;ldquo;functional L2&amp;rdquo; of Curve: a second layer that brings new features and a different set of tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Convex is not the only project that tried to realize this vision: there was also Yearn, which has now capitulated: Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Curve vaults are essentially through Convex, which is now more profitable. Since then, many projects are trying to offer a synergistic brick with the Curve/Convex behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crv-or-cvx&#34;&gt;CRV or CVX?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the basics of the separation between the two tokens here, that&amp;rsquo;s a matter for an entire article if you&amp;rsquo;re new to the subject: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence the Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be kept in mind that despite the computable equivalence between CVX and CRV (1vl CVX controls about 4.8 veCRV - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/Marcov/Convex-Finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), the two tokens have different tradeoffs as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between CRV and CVX tends to hold, despite frequent swings: lately, the pendulum seems to swing more towards CVX. Nevertheless I think there is still room for other approaches that start from the source (CRV) and they are starting to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paladin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing a protocol that helps liquidity providers on Curve maximize their returns and perhaps achieve the desirable 2.5x bonus by borrowing the capacity of veCRV tokens (provided by others) paid directly in CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are so many other subtleties and interactions to keep in mind in order to understand the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects, DAOs and protocols to win the Curve Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why this article proposes to review the CRV and CVX wars &lt;strong&gt;by visualizing and detailing the whole ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; that has developed around these two protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an image to describe this trend of multiplication of supports used to interact with Curve/Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to confuse the term with &amp;ldquo;true L2s&amp;rdquo; / scaling L2s: the term in its original sense to describe a new chain that inherits the security of its parent while allowing for higher transaction throughput and more moderate costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we start with Curve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Functional L2s&lt;/strong&gt;, then Convex&amp;rsquo;s (itself a Curve L2), then borrowing services to leverage the many sources of return offered by the entire Curve ecosystem, and we&amp;rsquo;ll finish with the CRV/CVX protocol-whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a dense and colorful adventure, but as is often the case with my articles, I&amp;rsquo;m offering you a summary of my research on the subject: enjoy your reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lose you on the way, I propose you this map which summarizes the main actors of the Curve/Convex ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convex-finance-curve-by-the-slice&#34;&gt;Convex Finance: Curve by the slice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is the first functional L2 of Curve; other projects preceded it (yveCRV and sdveCRV) but they were not as synergistic with Curve and therefore only marginally successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Convex provides access to maximized and liquid CRV token returns through cvxCRV. The ability to govern and vote on the Curve gauges corresponding to the underlying veCRV tokens is redirected to the owners of vlCVX. Convex thus provides easy access to the Curve ecosystem (for veCRV owners).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Convex controls a large amount of vlCVX, the centralization of voting power on gauges is avoided by offering this capability to the highest bidder through Votium (bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex is now basic, so I won&amp;rsquo;t detail it further here. My previous article on CRV Warfare went into more depth on the model and the contributions of Convex: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV Warfare: Understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warden-of-paladin-curve-on-steroids&#34;&gt;Warden of Paladin: Curve on steroids?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is another possible path for Curve LPs, which offers a different set of tradeoffs to Convex. Warden does not directly control veCRVs, but instead offers to rent the boosting capacity of LP Curve from veCRVs owned by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental is paid directly in CRVs and by the week. It comes from veCRV owners who make it available, for the price and duration of their choice. The deal is concluded through the delegation of the corresponding veCRVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-veboost.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LP Ve boost rental on Warden&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden thus returns to the LP Curve boost game. On Convex, most pools are boosted between 1.5 and 1.7x via Convex. Having your own stock of veCRV, increased by a Warden loan, allows you to reach 2x or even 2.5x maximum on certain pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Warden even offers a handy calculator to visualize the amount of veCRV needed to reach a given multiplier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-calc.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Warden Calculator&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden is therefore a credible alternative for protocols, DAOs and large carriers who would like to optimize their LP Curve in a perspective of maximizing the obtained CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;l2-convex&#34;&gt;L2 Convex
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is not yet one year old (May 2021) but given the preponderant place that the service already occupies, abstractions built on top of it were quick to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-convex-vote-auction&#34;&gt;Votium: Convex vote auction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Convex protocol concentrates the largest amount of veCRVs owned by a single entity. Nevertheless, the voting capacity corresponding to the veCRVs owned by Convex (obtained thanks to the cvxCRV) is distributed among all the owners of the CVX token that &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; it (vlCVX) for 16 weeks + 7 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via snapshot, they can mobilize their voting power directly on the Curve pool gauge of their choice. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt; is an additional layer built on top of this feature: Votium allows any project to allocate a budget to support a given Curve gauge. At the end of the round, the vlCVX owners who voted on this gauge share the rewards, according to their voting power: these are the famous bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/votium-bribes.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Votium bribes&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the impressive amount of veCRVs controlled by Convex, Votium has quickly emerged as &lt;strong&gt;an essential tool to establish and sustain a presence on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: consistent bribes on Votium can quickly make a Curve pool very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detail below the example of Frax Finance which offers around $5-7M of bribes each round; this allows to maintain attractive returns on the Frax/3CRV pool despite the massive dilution (the pool contains almost $3B of assets), and this without issuing their own token (FXS) for liquidity mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;llama-airforce-union-shared-management-of-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Llama Airforce Union: shared management of vlCVX
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bribes offered on Votium are very attractive: this allows vlCVX to reach a return &lt;strong&gt;of about 40% APR - most of which (90%) comes from the bribes&lt;/strong&gt;. However, managing your own vlCVX position has several constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas costs&lt;/strong&gt;, to lock in your vlCVX, but also to harvest the bribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is possible to delegate, this leads to a dispersion of the rewards (paid in a dozen different tokens -&amp;gt; gas fees). So small and medium vlCVX holders generally prefer to concentrate their vote on a given project: more practical, but it implies not forgetting to &lt;strong&gt;vote at each round&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Llama Airforce Union proposes to remedy these two main limitations, for the happiness of small holders as well as those who prefer a &lt;strong&gt;100% passive management of their vlCVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple: the Union pools the management of vlCVX. The only action required from the users is the delegation of their vlCVX voting power to the Union contract. Thereafter, the Union takes care of everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each round, the Union takes care of claiming all the obtained bribes, and sells them for cvxCRV (=mutualization/immense reduction of the impact of transaction fees).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obtained cvxCRV are then deposited in the Pounder, which stakes them with Convex and composes the yield automatically (uCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union thus offers a relevant alternative for CVX owners who intend to maintain and compound their position over the long term. As always, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to pay attention to the fees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas fees are passed on and distributed to all Union users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fee of 2% of the total bribes received is also charged in each round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The vlCVX are not taken into account since they are simply delegated to the Union (about 2.5M CVX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Union has been a rapid success. The project originated from the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://llama.airforce/#/convex/flyer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Llama Airforce&lt;/a&gt;, an already well-known source of information within the Curve/Convex ecosystem, which no doubt contributed to its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;concentrator-aladdindao&#34;&gt;Concentrator (AladdinDAO)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://concentrator.aladdin.club/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Concentrator&lt;/a&gt; is a bit like the Union, but this time for liquidity providers. Thus the Concentrator proposes to manage LP Curve for its depositors: the rewards (CRV, CVX and potential other tokens) are automatically sold for cvxCRV and automatically composed (staking on Convex) via the aCRV wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is interesting and rather synergistic with Curve and Convex: it&amp;rsquo;s a bit unfortunate to see that CVX are sold for the moment, but explained by the lack of available wrapper for vlCVX. The service offered by Concentrator is therefore rather relevant for &lt;strong&gt;small and medium sized carriers who want to use their LP Curve to maximize their CRV&lt;/strong&gt; token exposure in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;congruent-ccrv-curveconvex-flywheel-optimization&#34;&gt;Congruent CCRV: Curve/Convex flywheel optimization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the current limitations of Convex (or feature for some) is that despite the fairly dense liquidity in the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool, it is often unbalanced. CvxCRV is liquid against CRV, but rarely at 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccrv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCRV&lt;/a&gt; is therefore designed as a mechanism to help rebalance this pool, using both Curve and Convex. The principle is quite simple if you understand the mechanisms of Curve and Convex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/ccrv.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;CCRV.finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the cCRV token, backed by 1 cvxCRV. The protocol stakes all the cvxCRVs deposited to back cCRVs in Convex, in order to obtain a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the Curve 3CRV pool: CRV, cvxCRV and cCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes on the 3CRV pool to help it grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism will launch with an initial allocation of 1M CRV (provided by Congruent DAO). This will airdrop 1M cCRV (via bribes) over the first few weeks of the token&amp;rsquo;s existence to help it launch quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the launch plan seems pretty solid, the sustainability of the mechanism still seems uncertain. The addition of fees could allow the CCRV protocol to have its own liquidity (and therefore return in CRV, CVX and 3 pool) which could fuel the bribes while reducing their effective cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cCRV is not yet launched but is intended to be a &lt;strong&gt;new optimization of the flywheel Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, cCRV is being developed by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://congruent.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Congruent&lt;/a&gt;, a DAO that develops &amp;ldquo;Governance as a Service&amp;rdquo; (GaaS) products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bent-the-convex-of-convex&#34;&gt;Bent: the Convex of Convex?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.bentfinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bent&lt;/a&gt; is a true L2 Convex / L3 of Curve. The main question that arises with this project is whether there is anything to gain by going down to this level of depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, Bent works like Convex works for Curve: Bent allows you to stake Curve LP tokens: they are then staked in Convex (by Bent), and you benefit from an additional return paid with their native token - BENT, in exchange for fees collected by Bent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bentfinance-fees.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Bentfinance-fees&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may notice, the fee structure is almost identical to Convex. Finally, just as Convex created its own representation of CRV (cvxCRV), Bent creates its representation of CVX, the bentCVX. This can also be locked (weBENT) exactly like CVX-&amp;gt;vlCVX, for 8 weeks to get an additional yield corresponding to the bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks (Curve gauge round), weBENT holders vote on Snapshot to allocate their voting capacity on the gauges of their choice. The votes of the weBENT holders are echoed via the CVX owned by BentFinance, themselves echoed in CRV vote by Convex: two levels of depth!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-relevant-abstraction&#34;&gt;A relevant abstraction?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said when discussing Bent, the question here is not whether the model is relevant since Convex is living proof of that. Nevertheless, Convex is not a zero-sum game compared to Curve, since the protocol has brought new features that did not exist with just Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farm with LP Curve optimized, without having veCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Liquid Locking&amp;rdquo; (⚠ cvxCRV/CRV exchange rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the third point which is a bit of a consequence of the other two: Convex is now the biggest veCRV owner, and can therefore offer the bribe service (via Votium) with the most potential while being the most convenient (delegation, no need to claim every week, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I detail the contributions of Convex, it is obviously to ask the question: what does Bent bring &lt;strong&gt;functionally&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Convex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming option with LP Curve without owning a veCRV even more optimized than Convex, but all the outperformance comes from the BENT emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less restrictive locking of CVX than direct locking via vlCVX (8 weeks at Bent, 16 weeks + 7 days at Convex)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the third element is still missing to make Bent an interesting option, a mechanism that would create a real added value compared to Curve/Convex, in addition to farm optimization and a reduction of constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would be dishonest if I did not add one last point: the security and durability of the protocol. Indeed, Bent Finance has been attacked by an insider in December 2021 for several weeks. The attack was made possible by the fact that at that time, Bent&amp;rsquo;s contracts were not secured by a multisig: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://halborn.com/explained-the-bent-finance-hack-december-2021/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more information here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conic-finance-cnc--collective-liquidity-management-on-curveconvex&#34;&gt;Conic Finance (CNC) 🚧: collective liquidity management on Curve/Convex.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚧 reports a protocol not yet launched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Bent, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ConicFinance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Conic&lt;/a&gt; offers an additional abstraction from Curve LPs staked on Convex. However I think that this time the model has relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic introduces the concept of &amp;ldquo;omnipools&amp;rdquo;, which would simplify the management for Curve LPs by going back to the primitive level: here, it is directly the tokens that are deposited (e.g. USDC or DAI). The Conic omnipools will then distribute the tokens on different LP Curve positions which are then staked on Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depositors receive their CRV, CVX and CNC tokens from Conic. In a similar way to CVX, the CNC can be &amp;ldquo;vote locked&amp;rdquo; to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in bi-weekly gauge votes that determine the distribution of Curve pools by assets accepted on Conic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote on the whitelist and blacklist of accepted Curve pools (and thus eligible for gauges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in the vote to decide which assets are supported on Conic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other governance decisions, including the potential activation of fees for the service (initially there will be none).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic&amp;rsquo;s approach thus seems relevant and could be described as pooled asset management. It is a model reminiscent of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokemak.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tokemak&lt;/a&gt; and goes one step further than Curve/Convex which remains at the level of governance determination of incitations. Here, governance votes will result in the actual movement of assets between different Curve pools. If the protocol manages to attract sufficient liquidity, it could become a major player in the Curve Wars, potentially with its own bribe system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has just been unveiled and the approach being considered for launch is also interesting. Part of the CNC supply will be airdropped to vlCVX owners. For the rest, it will be distributed with community fundraising, liquidity mining on CNC/ETH and to depositors on Conic. To learn more, there is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ConicFinance/conic-finance-pre-launch-announcement-7b9f485f59f2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only one article available for now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;borrowing-services-with-lp-curveconvex-tokens-as-collateral&#34;&gt;Borrowing services with LP Curve/Convex tokens as collateral
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may start to get saturated just by mentioning a new potential wrapper on CRV, CVX or even cvxCRV: this is probably normal. Most of the protocols involved in the Curve Wars develop synergies directly at the token level, which remains the most direct. But we should not forget two other important types of actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols offering a synergistic service with the Curve/Convex LP, such as using it as collateral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols / DAOs that have large amounts of CVX and CRV and can use them to develop a strategic position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going to the whales and their strategies, I offer you two last analyses of protocols that allow you to borrow from an LP Curve position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lendflare-lft&#34;&gt;Lendflare (LFT)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lendflare.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lendflare&lt;/a&gt; allows Curve LPs to borrow from their position an asset that follows the same peg, for example a DAI borrow with the LP 3pool token (USDC/DAI/USDT) as collateral. This limitation avoids liquidations due to price changes between assets: with Lendflare as long as a borrower pays back his debt on or before the due date he is not liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical point, as with any money market, is to attract enough depositors to make borrowing as cheap as possible and therefore competitive. Lendflare follows the logic of Curve&amp;rsquo;s boosts: users who bring in cash (USDC, DAI, ETH or wBTC) to facilitate borrowing are rewarded with the LFT token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on Curve, here they can also benefit from a multiplier of up to 2.5x by locking in a quantity of LFT (veLFT) proportional to the deposit. There is even a very dense diagram that summarizes everything and will make you appreciate the special care I put into my home-made infographics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/lendflare.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LendFlare&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol is still in the midst of deployment, although the borrowing functionality is already available. An initial sale (IDO) of the LFT token is underway, and an airdrop is also being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curvance-cve-&#34;&gt;Curvance (CVE) 🚧
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curvance tackles the same problem but with a different approach. Here the protocol is not interested in Curve LPs as collateral, but rather &amp;ldquo;wrapped assets&amp;rdquo; in general like cvxCRV, bveCVX (Badger) or yvBOOST (Yearn). To enable the borrowing of stablecoins with these assets as collateral, they plan to isolate the risk by relying on Fuse pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the CVE token will be distributed to liquidity providers and a veCVE-like system is envisioned with a new subtlety: yet another wrap, a liquid version of the veCVE, the cveCVE that gives access to the veCVE&amp;rsquo;s yield but delegates governance capabilities to the DAO. Again, boosts, gauges, and even potentially bribes are envisioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the curious, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.curvance.com/cve/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;documentation is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daos-whales-in-cvx&#34;&gt;DAOs whales in CVX
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish this overview of the Curve/Convex ecosystem, we should not forget to look directly at the tokens - and in particular the DAOs that have large amounts of CRV or CVX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For CRV, there is not yet a clear dashboard summarizing the situation to my knowledge. For CVX on the other hand, there is a site for that: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;Daocvx.com&#34; &gt;daocvx.com&lt;/a&gt;. The protocols we will detail now do not have any synergy built natively with Curve or Convex, but they have a lot of CVX and use them to improve their competitive position in the CRV war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/daocvx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;daocvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you dig through the list on your own, we&amp;rsquo;ll just detail two: Frax and Badger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frax-finance-dominating-the-curve-gauge-game&#34;&gt;Frax Finance: Dominating the Curve Gauge Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frax has a long-standing strategy of dominating the Curve Gauge game to help drive FRAX adoption. It was one of the first DAOs to gain a consistent position in CVX; it is now the DAO with the &lt;strong&gt;largest position with over 2.1M CVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frax is also known to be the most aggressive project with bribes and frequently offers the largest Votium bribe for its FRAX/3crv pool. In the last round (14), Frax&amp;rsquo;s bribe was about &lt;strong&gt;40% of the total value of all bribes&lt;/strong&gt; paid in that round ($6.5M / $16.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Frax can afford to be so aggressive is that their vlCVX position reduces the effective cost of these bribes: thanks to their own votes, the protocol is able to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x090777069299e6e292363c6131b5cc5b463d598a7f89d3c7207148c0497587f8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recover&lt;/a&gt; a significant portion of the FXS used in each round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this strategy, the FRAX/3CRV pool is able to &lt;strong&gt;maintain a CRV issuance rate almost five times higher than the 3pool, for a similar total liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; (3pool: $3.3B, FRAX: $2.7B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;badger-a-small-corner-for-bitcoin&#34;&gt;Badger: a small corner for Bitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Badger has focused on optimizing farming with BTC on Ethereum. Initially, before Convex, Badger worked closely with Yearn, but with the launch of Convex and its rapid dominance, Badge&amp;rsquo;s position has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Frax, Badger did not buy its CVX. Instead, Badger is developing a model similar to Convex&amp;rsquo;s to accumulate CRV under control; the bveCVX vault. It offers a similar return to direct locking on Convex, but includes itself in the Badger ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bveCVX scales contribute to Badger&amp;rsquo;s internal boost system that is effective on most vaults. In addition, in each round the BadgerDAO uses the corresponding bveCVX voting power to support the Curve pools supported in Badger, which are essentially pools that involve one or more variants of wBTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than acquiring its position in CVX, Badger is able to obtain control of CVX tokens thanks to incentives - so it&amp;rsquo;s a sort of CVX rental. There is also a Curve bveCVX/CVX pool to allow early exit from the vault. There are now almost 1.7M CVX in the vault, so the strategy has proven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-daos&#34;&gt;Other DAOs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I focused on two projects that develop two very distinct strategies to accumulate CVX and weigh in on the Curve Wars. As you can see on the graph above, there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protocol develops a substantial position on CVX (say &amp;gt;300K CVX), it benefits directly from its tokens, especially in terms of liquidity. Nevertheless it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there: large CVX owners are in a strategic position and will also be courted very soon for different partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already see the mechanics at work, with the discussion around a potential 4pool (USDC/USDT/FRAX/UST), made possible thanks to the combined influences of Frax, Luna, Redacted and Olympus. The CVX protocols-whales thus become interfaces for the Curve Wars, it remains to be seen who will be able to make them the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NFTfi: NFT meets DeFi, liquidity and leverage ensue</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/nftfi-defi-nft/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/nftfi-defi-nft/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nft-defi-infrastructure-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post NFTfi: NFT meets DeFi, liquidity and leverage ensue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance has opened up a world of possibilities: a myriad of previously necessary intermediaries are now supernumerary. Nevertheless, it is intimidating because of its potential complexity and interdisciplinary. In addition to the obvious technical dimension, DeFi also invokes concepts from various disciplines: economics, social sciences, &amp;ldquo;memetics&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, for years now, NFTs have served as a gateway to the decentralized world, demonstrating the benefits of tokenization and disintermediation to a population still not very fond of DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I propose to converge the two main themes of this blog into one captivating topic: the emergence of DeFi infrastructure for NFTs, or the arrival of NFTs/gamification in DeFi - it&amp;rsquo;s all about perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defi--nft--nftfi--a-world-of-possibilities-for-your-jpegs&#34;&gt;DeFi + NFT =&amp;gt; NFTfi : a world of possibilities for your JPEGs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use cases at the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs are numerous and in full development. Rather than an exhaustive list, I propose to analyze a few emblematic projects to understand how they assemble elements from both universes to offer a relevant service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infography is a good starting point to deepen your analysis of the NFTfi landscape if this article arouses your curiosity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftfi-landscape.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftfi-landscape&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the most intuitive one for those who are already a bit up to date with DeFi: the arrival of a financial infrastructure to exchange, but also to lend, to make productive or to split NFTs. To tackle this vast subject, let&amp;rsquo;s start from the first layer: the infrastructure used to buy and sell NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nft-buying-and-selling-services&#34;&gt;NFT buying and selling services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, NFTs were in a strange in-between situation. In essence, NFTs allow disintermediation and more direct interaction between creators and their audience. With this disintermediation comes a massive reduction in the costs incurred to bring a work to market and new possibilities, such as their interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only thing is, NFTs are still exchanged mainly on a service that is not up to their standards, I named OpenSea - which still remains dominant although the situation is changing rapidly since the arrival of LooksRare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, OpenSea has many limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A near-weary fee for each exchange - 2.5% - and that is reserved exclusively for the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic lack of respect for the NFT community: violation of their privacy, manipulation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A certain disregard for the most community-based NFT projects: the verification mechanisms on OpenSea are not very transparent and do not really depend on the volume. Pitiful projects, but carried by celebrities, have been verified quickly while Luchadores, for example, are still waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of investment in its own development: the platform is slow to evolve and does not listen to its users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 100% business approach: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opensea/company_financials&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OpenSea has done 9 fundraisings&lt;/a&gt; so far, and this despite the gargantuan profits they generate via the excessive fees charged: $100M in volume &lt;strong&gt;on 1 day ⇒ $2.5M in the team&amp;rsquo;s pockets&lt;/strong&gt; (- operational fees, but still&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get a situation close to the US ISPs: OpenSea is used by everyone in the NFT world, but also &lt;strong&gt;virtually hated by a significant part of its users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the data which speaks for itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/looksrare-vs-opensea.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;looksrare-vs-opensea&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just looking at volume here. In terms of number of users and transactions OpenSea still dominates. You can find all the data on the super dashboard &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hildobby_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;from Hildoby&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/hildobby/LooksRare-VS-OpenSea&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LooksRare VS Opensea (Dune Analytics)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us were waiting for a credible alternative, and fortunately it has arrived: LooksRare. The case is worth digging into, but in short LooksRare is the exact opposite of OpenSea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction fees are reduced to 2% and &lt;strong&gt;redistributed entirely&lt;/strong&gt; to LOOKS token stakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LooksRare team is very attentive to the community and in two months of existence, they have already implemented many features requested by their users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LOOKS token has been airdropped to OpenSea users. It can now be obtained by buying or selling NFT on Looksrare: &lt;strong&gt;a direct distribution&lt;/strong&gt; to the users of the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) strategy is implemented by the protocol: a significant part of the liquidity on LOOKS is owned directly by the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol already has nearly $13M in ETH+LOOK deployed on UniswapV3 to support liquidity - here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://debank.com/profile/0xc8c57e4c73c71f72ca0a7e043e5d2d144f98ef13&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LooksRare&amp;rsquo;s wallet&lt;/a&gt; to see for yourself. The fees collected on the LP are used to&amp;hellip; bring more and more liquidity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/looksrare-pol.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;looksrare-pol&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new set of rules allows LooksRare to be extremely competitive compared to Opensea, since the fee is 20% lower, and each purchase/sale is also paid in LOOKS. The result is clear: both buyers and sellers benefit from preferring LooksRare to Opensea.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization-explained-with-nfts-partialization&#34;&gt;Tokenization explained with NFTs partialization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanging NFTs is great: you still need to understand what&amp;rsquo;s in the box! We will therefore detail the stakes of tokenization with several examples. Indeed, the possibilities offered by the latter are immense, so let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the time to explain the concept. Tokenization is the action of creating a token (a token that &lt;strong&gt;represents&lt;/strong&gt; something). At first sight like that, the interest can be hard to conceive. However, tokenizing also allows for a form of &amp;ldquo;alchemy&amp;rdquo;: a transmutation - a change in the type of token from fungible to non-fungible, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example that illustrates the benefits of tokenization - the case of &lt;strong&gt;fractionalizing an NFT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We start with a specific non-fungible token, CryptoPunk #666 for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We lock it in a contract that issues 10 000 PUNK tokens, ERC-20 tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now have a token that represents 1/10,000 of the original CryptoPunk #666. This token is a classic ERC-20 and therefore easily exchangeable via Uniswap or other (⚠️ Liquidity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ Tokenization here allows &lt;strong&gt;collective ownership of a unique asset&lt;/strong&gt; (the NFT CryptoPunk #666).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept, while illustrating the benefits of tokenization also corresponds to a real use case. The reality is of course more complex, since we have only described here the collectivization mechanism (1 NFT ⇒ 10 000 ERC20). The reverse path is also possible to recover access to the locked NFT: 10 000 PUNK ⇒ NFT CryptoPunk #666: this is privatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is the one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://spectre.xyz/litepaper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Spectrum.xyz&lt;/a&gt;, a service that allows to manage the collectivization and privatization of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/spectre.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;spectre-xyz&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the collective possession, such a solution also has an interest in terms of liquidity: the obtained token (PUNK) is a classic ERC20, it is thus much easier to develop solutions allowing its immediate purchase and sale than with an NFT, which requires the meeting of a simultaneous demand and offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization-to-develop-liquidity-vaults&#34;&gt;Tokenization to develop liquidity: vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once tokenization is well understood, the next chapter - NFT vaults - is almost a given. One of the challenges of NFTs is the liquidity of the markets. Non-fungibility is great for making collections of 10,000 coins, all of which are unique but similar - but what about the valuation and exchange of these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides LooksRare and Opensea mentioned above, there are other marketplaces for NFTs that rely on a different logic: this is &lt;strong&gt;the NFT vault model&lt;/strong&gt; - which has many interests, but also limitations - the main one being that this approach is only possible with large collections (several hundred units) and/or quite popular (high demand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[MINT] A &amp;ldquo;vault&amp;rdquo; (smart contract) specific to a collection is created; users can deposit their NFTs in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user deposits an NFT in the vault, its contribution is recognized by the emission of an ERC20 token.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠️ As you can see, the vault assumes that all NFTs are equivalent: so it is better to enter a vault with an NFT among the least rare of the given collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader in this field is probably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nftx.io/vault/0x87931e7ad81914e7898d07c68f145fc0a553d8fb/info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFTX&lt;/a&gt;, but there is also &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nft20.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFT20&lt;/a&gt;. This method allows you to get an ERC20 token - for example the WIZARD - that corresponds to a claim on any NFT in the vault, in this case any of the 215 Forgotten Wizard Cult (NFTs) contained in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nftx.io/vault/0x87931e7ad81914e7898d07c68f145fc0a553d8fb/info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the vault.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftx-wizard-list.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftx-wizard-list&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity on the WIZARD token can be developed against ETH for example, allowing the immediate purchase of any wizard contained in the vault. The reverse is also possible: any owner of a Forgotten Wizard Cult can deposit it in the vault in order to obtain 1 WIZARD which he can then sell for ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally NFTX goes even further since the platform&amp;rsquo;s native token as well as the collected fees are used to offer incentives to deṕoser in the vault and develop liquidity. &lt;strong&gt;Users who&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;deposit NFTs into the vault are thus eligible for a staking fee&lt;/strong&gt; - and higher returns are possible for those who deposit + LP: the financialization of NFTs is launched!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftx-wizard.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftx-wizard&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus here is on liquidity, but keep in mind that switching from an NFT to an ERC-20 comes with many other benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the liquidity on the pair is sufficient - then it also becomes &lt;strong&gt;a price source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price source (oracle) + liquidity means&amp;hellip; collateral of course! With these two elements, there is nothing to prevent the WIZARD from being considered as &lt;strong&gt;collateral for borrowing&lt;/strong&gt; other tokens like stablecoins. This is feasible but much more complex starting directly from the NFT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, keep in mind that there is no limit to tokenization, as long as there is an interest. We stayed here on single tokenization cases, but &lt;strong&gt;tangled tokenization&lt;/strong&gt; scenarios are also possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ERC-20 token that represents a claim on a given Wizard is great. Now imagine that you have the same thing for CryptoPunks, BAYC and so on - this is the case on NFTX. There is nothing to prevent us from considering an additional tokenization step to create an &lt;strong&gt;NFT index&lt;/strong&gt; represented by an ERC20 token but which would itself &lt;strong&gt;be exchangeable against the tokens representing the underlying assets:&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could thus imagine the NFT-Bluechip-Index, an ERC-20 token created by locking 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC. This token would be easily liquid, and thus allow for easy exposure to all three collections in a single transaction. In addition, the token would remain fully collateralized at all times by 1 NFT from each collection. An owner of the NFT-Bluechip-Index could do the opposite at any time, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[With the NFT-Bluechip contract] : burn 1 NFT-Bluechip-Index to get 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Using NFTX contracts/vaults] burn of 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC to retrieve one NFT (of your choice from those in the vault) from each underlying collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;idol--ntfs-to-tokenize-a-defi-yield&#34;&gt;Idol : NTFs to tokenize a DeFi yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue and finish on tokenization, know that it also allows to link the two worlds - NFTs and DeFi: the perfect example here is the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theidols.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IdolsNFT&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IdolsNFT were initially sold via a bonding curve for a price between 0.25 and 0.5 ETH. All ETH collected during the sale are staked via Lido (StETH). Owning an Idol makes you eligible for the corresponding share of the returns. Here, it is the yield generated by the StETH that is tokenized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/idol-nfts.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;idols-nft&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the project goes even further! Indeed, there is also an ERC-20 in the story, the VIRTUE, initially distributed to the first buyers. From now on, to obtain VIRTUE, it is necessary to bond stETH (-&amp;gt; which increases the productive capital of the project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIRTUE corresponds to a proxy exposure on NFT Idols: for each sale of an NFT Idol, a fee of 7.5% is taken and given to the VIRTUE stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/idol-cycle.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;idolnfts-virtue-cycle&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Idols, &amp;ldquo;Guardians of Ethereum&amp;rdquo; use NFTs to make ETH staking more fun and interactive. In addition, the capture of fees on the VIRTUE token allows to avoid an &amp;ldquo;external capture&amp;rdquo; of fees generated by IdolsNFT exchanges as it is the case for NFTs exchanged on NFTX for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the large owners of the collection have a clear path to compound their return if their conviction is strong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possession of several IdolsNFT ⇒ Yield in stETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composition of farmed stETH via bonding ⇒ VIRTUE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake of VIRTUE ⇒ Yield in ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staking ETH with Lido ⇒ StETH ⇒ Bonding for VIRTUE then stake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens with this collection, I think it has laid the foundation for what NFTs collections augmented by and synergistic with DeFi can be. I expect to see many more relevant variations on this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggregation-of-various-liquidity-sources&#34;&gt;Aggregation of various liquidity sources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have already mentioned three different platforms to buy or sell NFTs: OpenSea, LooksRare and NFTX. The reality is even denser, there is an armada of marketplaces for NFTs, more or less successful and more or less specialized, here are some others: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://superrare.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Superrare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://foundation.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nft20.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFT20&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with this myriad of options, buyers do not necessarily have the time, inclination, energy or knowledge to explore all their options before concluding a transaction. The situation is very similar to buying/selling an ERC20 token in DeFi: liquidity is very fragmented. Logically, the solution is therefore similar to the one deployed in DeFi: aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/gem-xyz.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gem.xyz&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there are several services capable of directing &amp;ldquo;orders&amp;rdquo; to different marketplaces, or even ŕealising a &amp;ldquo;swipe&amp;rdquo; across multiple platforms with a single transaction: these are &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://genie.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gem.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, it is the responsiveness of the team and the composability of the service that will make the difference in the long run: Gem seems to be ahead of the game thanks to its advanced integration of LooksRare (claim LOOKS possible for buyers via Gem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nft--defi--games-with-real-stakes&#34;&gt;NFT + DeFi =&amp;gt; Games with real stakes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If DeFi has discovered the huge market that is NFTs recently, the reverse march is also observed: &lt;strong&gt;the arrival of DeFi components in NFTs projects&lt;/strong&gt; - we often talk about GameFi to describe this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been several years since the first iterations of GameFi appeared, with games that can become a credible source of income for their players: the most famous is of course &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://axieinfinity.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, but there are many others: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.aavegotchi.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AaveGotchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cryptoraiders.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CryptoRaiders&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not very active on these projects myself, so I propose to detail one that is more familiar to me: Luchadores. Here again, we find DeFi components that are grafted on the NFT project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a Luchador (NFT) gives the right to a return in LUCHA (ERC20 token).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol owns about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://debank.com/profile/0x0cb11b92fa5c30eafe4ae84b7bb4df3034c38b9d&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;60% of the liquidity on the two LUCHA pairs&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the funds raised during the sale of the first pinatas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 🪅 are ERC-1155 tokens that contain 1 accessory for Luchadores, whose rarity is determined by verifiable randomness (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.chain.link/vrf-v2-mainnet-launch/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chainlink VRF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol also has about 30 Luchadores (⇒Yield in LUCHA) purchased with part of the profits from the first pinata: the purchase was made using an aggregator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A marketplace is available for accessories, with payment in LUCHA: a redistribution of the collected fees is also possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/luchadores.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is not yet available (Alpha by the end of March!), but interactions of this type will only become more dense as it develops. With the arrival of the game, new features will come: staking your LUCHA tokens will allow you to get MASK, a non-transferable token but necessary to buy different items to increase the power of your Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the launch of the game, players will earn LUCHA for each victory. Depending on their ranking, the amount of LUCHA obtained increases: the best players will be able to get interesting returns, for a very moderate initial cost (1 Luchador, potentially minted for ~0.03 ETH). Be prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you discover Luchadores with this article, feel free to read this introduction: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/luchadores-nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🤼 Long live free (and verifiable onchain) wrestling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have stayed on the visible part of the iceberg. At the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs, there are still many new possible use cases. I propose to make a list with the main services that explore these fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;floordao--nft-x-defi-x-dao&#34;&gt;FloorDAO : NFT x DeFi x DAO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://floor.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FloorDAO&lt;/a&gt; is sort of an extra layer built on top of NFTX. FloorDAO uses the OlympusDAO model but adapted for NFTs. The objective is to ensure a return and support liquidity on the collections concerned (Punk and Wizard for the moment). How does it work? Simple: for the concerned collections, the owners of the corresponding NFTX token (ex WIZARD for Forgotten Wizards) as well as the LP (WIZARD/ETH) can bond it to obtain FLOOR tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/floordao-bond.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;floordao-bond&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collected tokens and LPs are used by FloorDAO to generate a return (NFTX staking). The community (gFLOOR holders) votes to decide which assets to acquire next. Olympus uses the inflation of its governance token to acquire strategic assets such as DAI, LUSD, or CRV; FloorDAO does the same thing but targets NFTX tokens and therefore backs them with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, the protocol owns a share of its own liquidity on FLOOR/ETH (on Uniswap) and the fees generated by the position contribute to the returns of the FloorDAO treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nfts-to-collateralize-loans-without-going-through-an-erc20vault&#34;&gt;NFTs to collateralize loans (without going through an ERC20/vault)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main limitation to overcome here is of course the fact that the sale of NFT is done in a bid/ask logic and is therefore not immediate. Several projects are nevertheless tackling the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://drops.co&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/defi-vs-inflation-tokenbrice-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to build an inflation-proof DeFi portfolio?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation is more than ever at the center of discussions and concerns: no one understands much about it, no economist has really anticipated it, but we all have an opinion about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we leave economics and politics aside to focus on what matters for your wallet: in decentralized finance, all kinds of protocols are developed, and a good part of them &lt;strong&gt;provide credible and innovative tools to preserve and develop the purchasing power of a portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;, even when the macroeconomic context is most uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to evaluate strategies involving different assets and protocols, all with the same goal: to preserve and develop the effective purchasing power of a given portfolio. Nevertheless, we have to start with the basics, level 0: what is inflation and why should we, DeFians, care about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover image was made by a generous anonymous contributor and features the majestic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/valkyre/created&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Valkyr-E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;α-tutorial-understanding-the-impact-of-inflation-on-a-crypto-portfolio&#34;&gt;α/ Tutorial: Understanding the impact of inflation on a crypto portfolio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t venture into the details of inflation for fiat currencies here, but the basic concept is known to anyone familiar with cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the term: here is how the INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques) defines inflation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is the loss of purchasing power of money that results in a general and lasting increase in prices. It must be distinguished from the increase in the cost of living. The loss of value of money is a phenomenon that hits the national economy as a whole (households, businesses, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just remember that, &lt;strong&gt;just like in DeFi where each token is associated with a protocol and potentially even an ecosystem, each fiat currency is also based on an economy as well as a set of rules&lt;/strong&gt; (legal system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inflation-macro-point-of-view-scale--country&#34;&gt;Inflation, macro point of view (scale = country)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation corresponds to the production of new money, the important thing is not so much the quantity of money created, but more &lt;strong&gt;what is done with&lt;/strong&gt;. We all understand this rather well with two caricatural examples at each extreme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central bank of country A issues a large amount of money in order to invest massively in its transport infrastructure and its energy supply (= long-term investments).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, inflation can be controlled because the new money issued is used to finance investments that develop the country&amp;rsquo;s economic potential in the long run (-&amp;gt; compensation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central bank of country B issues a large amount of money to finance an emergency plan to compensate for the foreseeable consequences of previous pseudo-sanitary measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this second scenario, the new money is used to cover a &amp;ldquo;current expense&amp;rdquo; of the government. The personal equivalent would be to go into debt every day to pay for lunch. This is obviously unsustainable in the long run. In this scenario, inflation can only be massive as a large amount of new money is issued, while the economic potential of the country in question stagnates or deteriorates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluating-future-inflation&#34;&gt;Evaluating future inflation?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough about the macro, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to our scale, with things we know well. Here is the evolution of the M1 money supply on the dollar, this allows us to visualize its &amp;ldquo;marketcap&amp;rdquo; in a way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/USD-m1-supply.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;USD M1 Supply&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we only look at M1 for simplicity but the trend is similar on M2 and M3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested here in the dollar which, although challenged, remains the fiduciary currency that sets the tone. As you can see, the curve has been going vertical since the beginning of the Covid crisis. The curve is now much scarier than the worst shitcoins I have ever seen. Doubt it? Consider the same information, presented in this light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dollar has been around since 1914. 20% of all dollars in circulation were created in 2020. At the current rate, the total amount of dollars in circulation doubles about every 4-5 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare with crypto, many are concerned about inflation / new token issuance on Curve Finance (CRV). The 4 year issuance curve looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/crv-release-schedule.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;crv-release-schedule&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no economist, but I know my shitcoins. The official US inflation figure we are given is 7.5% per year. Like unemployment figures, it&amp;rsquo;s a highly political metric that&amp;rsquo;s hard to really appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7.5% figure may seem high, but it is still low when compared to the unprecedented money creation to deal with Covid. So I expect to see this inflation rise further, or else to be sustained over an extended period of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So inflation is here, at 7.5% minimum for several years at least. Enough with boomers&amp;rsquo; macro, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the range of tools that the DeFi offers us to face it and overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-beating-inflation-with-classic-stablecoin-returns&#34;&gt;I/ Beating inflation with &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; stablecoin returns
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first approach is as always the simplest, &lt;strong&gt;the brute force method&lt;/strong&gt;: an inflation of 7.5% means that USD left as is will lose 7.5% of their value over the year. The point here is to find a source of return higher than inflation: the difference between the two is the effective return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With inflation at 7.5% on the USD, I think it is prudent to make sure to &lt;strong&gt;reach at least 1.5x this figure in yield&lt;/strong&gt; to really consider yourself inflation-proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the game is simple and the rules fairly easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You start with a position in a given stablecoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal is to make it productive, without assuming IL risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a return that exceeds the inflation figure, once the gas costs have been amortized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-stablecoin-deposit&#34;&gt;Simple stablecoin deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we would aim for &lt;strong&gt;a 10.875% annual return on stablecoin $ at the very least&lt;/strong&gt;. With recent declines and yield compression this is increasingly difficult, but still findable even with a single stablecoin deposit without IL risk. Tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://coindix.com/?kind=stable&amp;amp;sort=-apy&amp;amp;chain=ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Coindix&lt;/a&gt; can help you find the vault of your dreams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/coindix.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;coindix&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful though, &lt;strong&gt;not all vaults are created equal&lt;/strong&gt;! For example, we see nice returns on Bancor on the screenshot: don&amp;rsquo;t forget to consider the volatility of these returns as well as the fees in gas to deploy the position (a Bancor LP is notoriously more expensive than a Yearn deposit for example).&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Anchor protocol&lt;/a&gt; also offers you a &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; return close to 20% on UST stablecoin. Such a guaranteed rate does not come, of course, without serious compromises that raise real questions about the sustainability of this whole ecosystem (Terra/Luna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;provision-of-liquidity--time-commitment&#34;&gt;Provision of liquidity + time commitment
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in dollars, but a bit riskier, we can consider different types of commitments, with very controlled / no IL risks. For example, a liquidity provision between FRAX and DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/frax-dai.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;FRAX/DAI LP opportunities on Frax&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://frax.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frax Finance&lt;/a&gt;, the prime rate (x1) is just our minimum target, but it is possible to reach up to x5 with two types of commitment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X3 by locking LP tokens for 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X2 by using your veFXS (much harder to reach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective return on a position locked in for three years corresponds to about 3 times our minimum target, thus offering a credible protection against the loss of value due to the consequences of inflation, but you still have to be able to assume the three-year commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example is taken here on DAI, but the situation is similar on the other major stablecoins; for example, here are the FRAX/USDC pools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/frax-usdc.png&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenizing-and-speculating-on-future-yields&#34;&gt;Tokenizing and speculating on future yields
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To beat that famous 10% return on the dollar, there are still many other options. I present you one last one here to help you consider the other possible strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this one, we rely on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that allows the tokenization of future yields on productive assets. The principle is both simple and complex: depositing an asset on APWine allows to separate its future yield (FYT: Future Yield Token) from the underlying principal (PT: Principal Token).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, different strategies are possible, such as immediately selling the future yield (FYT) in order to increase the quantity of the productive principal. Such a tool enables better risk management considering the volatily of yields observed in DeFi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s keep it simple and still well above the 10% requirement: let&amp;rsquo;s zoom in on the aUSDT vault of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/apwine-USDT-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;APWine aUSDT vault&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I automatically exclude the PT/FYT pool which is more complex to understand and has much higher risks than the PT/Underlying offering a 44% return in APW anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the strategy is simple, but you have to &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind the important gas costs linked to the use of APWine&lt;/strong&gt;. To implement the strategy using USDT in the wallet, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Deposit a part of them on Aave (I&amp;rsquo;d recommend 55% of the total maximum for this specific strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Deposit the aUSDT obtained in 1 on APWine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow (x2) + Deposit the PT and Underlying (USDT) tokens as liquidity providing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Stake of the LPs PT/Underlying tokens to obtain the return in APW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget also the gas fees related to the APW claims + unwinding of the position at the end of the period (or before).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore better to wait for a day when the transactions clear under 30 gwei so as not to suffer too much from the gas costs on such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage here, compared to Frax for example, is that &lt;strong&gt;the position is much more liquid&lt;/strong&gt;. APWine works with an epoch logic that lasts 90 days. Thus, to more easily amortize the costs in gas it is preferable to deploy the strategy at the beginning of the epoch: this is also when the returns are generally the highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third winelisting (where the next tokens supported on APWine are decided) has just ended, so don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to prepare for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/apw-winelisting3.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;APWine - Winelisting 3&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APWine is still a young protocol, but the governance is dynamic. The next step is approaching: as on Curve, it will soon be the veAPW holders (locked APW) that &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.apwine.fi/t/apgp-2-enable-gauges-for-apw-rewards/171&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;will decide on emissions&lt;/a&gt; for each given vault. A redistribution of the cards is to be expected, plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-hedged-productive-positions-with-various-alternative-stablecoins&#34;&gt;II/ Hedged productive positions with various &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; stablecoins
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have stayed for now on the dollar, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to begin with. Although dollar stablecoins are still largely dominant, there are now &lt;strong&gt;many stablecoins based on other fiat currencies&lt;/strong&gt; such as EUR, JPY (Japanese Yen), CHF (Swiss Franc), KRW (Korean Won) or even CAD (Canadian Dollar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the few centralized stablecoins (EURS or EURT), this market is mostly covered by protocols that offer to create synthetic stablecoins backed by other stablecoins. This is the case for example with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jarvis.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jarvis Network&lt;/a&gt;, which uses USDC to collateralize different types of stablecoins: jEUR, jCHF, jKRW, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;single-deposit&#34;&gt;Single deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yield opportunities with no/low IL for such stablecoins are still quite rare, and usually found on Curve: providing liquidity against other stablecoins based on the same fiat currency, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/curve-chf.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;CHF pool on Curve Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few stablecoins have lucrative single deposit options jEUR, jCHF, jJPY. They are based on the corresponding Curve pools, with additional incentives offered by Jarvis and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Jarvis (also available farmed by Harvest), it is also possible to generate a return without IL on jCAD and jJPY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiatafiatb-liquidity-providing&#34;&gt;FiatA/FiatB Liquidity Providing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a slightly different approach, more risky, but also potentially more protective against inflation: providing liquidity on two stablecoins representing two different fiat currencies, for example EURT/3pool (USD) still on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, especially for smaller portfolios, many alternative stablecoins are available on Polygon or Avalanche, with a fairly dense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarvis offers jCHF-USDC, jEUR-USDC or jCAD-USDC pools with returns above 20%. Tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://beefy.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Beefy.Finance&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to automatically compose the returns obtained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/harvest-jarvis-2-stables.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Harvest Network Jarvis jFIAT&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: depending on your base asset (e.g. USDC), exposure to EUR (or other currencies) can be lucrative or costly - depending on the evolution of the USDC/EUR exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the more adventurous among you, you should know that APWine is also available on Polygon and already supports several Jarvis tokens, such as the MooJarvis_4eur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity contribution on Curve (4eur)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed by Beefy Finance (moo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which compounds return that Jarvis offers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the addition of tokens voted during winelisting 3 will open new doors with the upcoming arrival on APWine/Polygon of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooKyber_USDC-jEUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooMai_USDC-MAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forex-borrowing&#34;&gt;Forex Borrowing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if liquidations don&amp;rsquo;t scare you, know that a Fuse pool on Polygon (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pool7 - Jarvis Forex Market&lt;/a&gt;) allows you to use different jFiat as collateral as well as to borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/fuse-pool7.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Fuse pool 7&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a service, almost anything is possible, here are some examples to inspire you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long USD + short EUR = MAI in collateral, borrow jEUR then sell jEUR and potentially loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short GBP via CHF = jCHF in collateral, borrow jGBP then sell and potential loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also note that the productive stablecoins m2CAD and m2JPY are available as collateral while keeping their yield: they can be interesting for more traditional leverage strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-your-balance&#34;&gt;Finding your balance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just one magic position, what I like about Jarvis stablecoins is the ability to &lt;strong&gt;diversify easily into different types of fiat currencies&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to the low transaction fees on Polygon, it is quite possible to mix several different currencies and positions to make a coherent whole and well protected against its local inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for a European (= spending €):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% in stable productive € without IL, for example MooJarvis_4eur (+APWine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% in jEUR/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% in stable productive dollar (e.g. aUSDT APWine strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp; Diversification: 15% jCHF/USDC + 15% jGBP/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while we&amp;rsquo;re on the subject of &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; stablecoins, you should know that there are also a few that track gold or silver - they can be relevant from this perspective too. For example XAUT (with Pool Curve XAUT/3crv). Gold and silver remain &lt;del&gt;barbaric&lt;/del&gt; boomers&amp;rsquo; relics, personally I see very little interest in them for a competent DeFian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-inflation-resistant-stablecoins&#34;&gt;III/ Inflation resistant stablecoins
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beating inflation is nice. Hedging it? Even better. But &lt;strong&gt;why not just abstract it&lt;/strong&gt;, using products that are naturally resistant to it? There are still very few stablecoins that are not tracking fiat currencies, but the supply is growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-the-first-dollar-free-stablecoin&#34;&gt;RAI, the first dollar-free stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a strange beast, the very first &amp;ldquo;unpegged stablecoin.&amp;rdquo; Launched at a value of Pi in USD (3.14) in 2021, it has been moving between 3.02 and 3.06 almost since its launch. Given its recent arrival (just over a year), it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how RAI will perform in a period of prolonged inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, diversifying a portion of your stablecoins into RAI may be an attractive option. In addition, there are different return options available on RAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple deposit without IL risk: Idle Finance deposits your RAI in Fuse/Aave to optimize the native return + incentives in FLX from Reflexer + incentives in IDLE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/rai-idle-0.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Additional FLX incentives for RAI on Idle Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By assuming IL risk via liquidity provision on Curve vs. 3pool, a better return is possible. The crvRAI can then be staked directly on Curve or via Convex or Yearn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAI is based on a mechanism inspired by Maker MCD but with many modifications to make it possible. To understand how it works, I invite you to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/reflexer-rai/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚧 Signals that the mentioned protocol is still under development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;-an-inflation-resistant-stablecoin-the-frax-fpi&#34;&gt;🚧 An inflation-resistant stablecoin? The FRAX FPI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frax Price Index is a new protocol that should arrive soon within the Frax ecosystem. The goal is to offer a new stablecoin, which would follow the CPI (Consumer Price Index) to protect against inflation. Just like Frax, &lt;strong&gt;the system is based on two tokens&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stable - Frax Price Index (FPI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the governance token - Frax Price Index Share (FPIS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.frax.finance/frax-price-index/inflation-hedge&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frax documentation&lt;/a&gt; offers some information about the upcoming token. &lt;strong&gt;An airdrop of FPIS is planned&lt;/strong&gt; for veFXS or cvxFXS holders. Thus, the protocol will be independent of FRAX/FXS, although a value capture mechanism to FXS is planned beyond the initial airdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to project solely on a mere design, but it is clear that a stablecoin that would maintain its value despite inflation is a very desirable product. &lt;strong&gt;There are several questions as to whether the peg on FPI can be maintained&lt;/strong&gt;: to keep its equilibrium, people will have to take the opposite trade to FPI, i.e. &amp;ldquo;short inflation&amp;rdquo;. However, in the current context of galloping inflation, it is hard to imagine who could assume such a position and massive incentives might be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the arrival of the FPI is imminent. Traces of the token &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb68c6264e9d0f8a6df1fa5a89f205da38698d15&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FPIS on EtherScan&lt;/a&gt; can be found as early as early March. I look forward to seeing the Frax team&amp;rsquo;s proposed design to address these consequential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-inflation-resistance--degen--volt&#34;&gt;🚧 Inflation resistance + degen = VOLT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Frax&amp;rsquo;s FPI, there is another project I&amp;rsquo;ve been following closely, waiting for a long time and holding high hopes for. The high-level concept is very simple: an Abracadabra-like product that would not be a walking security loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Abracadabra allows borrowing from various productive collaterals, which makes the service desirable. Nevertheless, the infrastructure is close to a hack and the actions of the team members make Abracadabra a second or third grade money market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here, with Volt, is to cover the same vertical using a proven infrastructure: the base offered by Reflexer (RAI). Three main changes are expected on this model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike Reflexer, which only accepts ETH as collateral, Volt will diversify the available options, notably with productive collateral such as wstETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of VOLT, the system&amp;rsquo;s stablecoin, will be indexed to Frax&amp;rsquo;s FPI. The Reflexer infrastructure will be reused (PID controller adapted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Volt team is also working in collaboration with Fuse and Olympus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow Volt, as always, the alpha lives on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/dGhvDmCNGr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

The vision of creating a borrowing service with an inflation-proof stablecoin remains, but the technical choices have evolved. Read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/volt-protocol/whitepaper/blob/main/volt.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the whitepaper available here&lt;/a&gt; for the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-beating-inflation-with-returns-on-volatile-assets&#34;&gt;IV/ Beating inflation with returns on volatile assets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a world where nothing holds and value leaks, what&amp;rsquo;s left? How about good, proven DeFi assets backed by protocols with massive, recurring revenues shared directly with their holders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few of them, very few. We will detail them one by one, as well as the different options available on them to produce a return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth-the-origin-and-the-end&#34;&gt;ETH: the origin and the end
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is of course ETH, which has many different sources of return - just like stablecoins, there is nothing to stop you from diversifying your ETH exposure with several sources of return, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH staked with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lido.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lido Finance &lt;/a&gt;(low yield, but a priori the safest) [~5%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LP &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rocketpool.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;rETH&lt;/a&gt; on Curve (more innovative, more lucrative, more risky) [~10%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vault covered call options on ETH via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Stakedao&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ribbon.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ribbon Finance&lt;/a&gt; [~25%, risks!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-chain liquidity on a Bridge, for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cbridge.celer.network/#/liquidity&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Celer&lt;/a&gt; [~10%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A position balanced in this way tracks/exceeds inflation slightly with the returns obtained on ETH. The profitability of the position over the long term depends of course mainly on the average entry price on ETH and its evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crv-cvx-and-fxs-the-three-fates-of-the-defi&#34;&gt;CRV, CVX, and FXS: The three Fates of the DeFi?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Romans, the Fates are three goddesses who govern the lives of humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clotho weaves the thread of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lachesis unwinds it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atropos cuts it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi also knows these Fates: three protocols that play a critical role in the survival and growth of potentially any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in addition to ETH, there are several DeFi projects that have already proven themselves, control substantial revenue streams, and offer a truly relevant service in a macro context of prolonged inflation; I see three essentially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve Finance - CRV&lt;/strong&gt;: the mother of all yields in DeFi + peg machine and liquidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convex Finance - CVX&lt;/strong&gt;: an option on CRV, which controls almost 50% of all locked CRVs and adds real value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frax Finance - FXS&lt;/strong&gt;: innovative stable project, native DeFi, very productive via AMOs + arrival of FPI + Frax has a big position on CVX &amp;amp; some other protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being tokens backed by key protocols in DeFi, there is no shortage of return options on these three tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV -&amp;gt; Deposit on Convex in CvxCRV then stake or LP cvxCRV/CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVX -&amp;gt; Locked vote on Convex in vlCVX -&amp;gt; Return in cvxCRV + bribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FXS -&amp;gt; Direct deposit on Frax (veFXS) or management via Convex (cvxFXS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-promising-tokens&#34;&gt;Other promising tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are still other projects that have not yet reached the profitability of Curve or Convex but represent credible bets. In a world where inflation is here to stay, the tools that will allow us to protect ourselves from it can become very popular: I propose you some other theses related to what has been already mentioned in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;apwinefi-apw-betting-on-the-advanced-defi-infrastructure&#34;&gt;APWine.fi (APW): betting on the advanced DeFi infrastructure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inflation goes up, everyone is looking for yield. Let them run behind the %, and instead target the pick sellers in this gold rush. This is the main thesis behind a bet on APW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you could see in the article already, APWine offers interesting products to bet on the evolution of yields or even realize a future yield immediately. As DeFi develops, the demand for a product like APWine will keep growing. Will it be APWine, or another one? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the APWine Wars coming up, it&amp;rsquo;s not a stretch to envision bribes similar to what we see on Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reflexer-flx-a-bet-on-degovernance&#34;&gt;Reflexer (FLX): a bet on degovernance
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the very interesting technical approach, Reflexer also innovates on another level. Indeed, since the launch of the protocol, the team has presented a &amp;ldquo;De-governance Plan&amp;rdquo; aiming at progressively minimizing the team&amp;rsquo;s control over the protocol through two main means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation of everything that can be automated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management by FLX holders for situations still requiring manual analysis/decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;strong&gt;Reflexer now exceeds RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. The Money God League is a set of projects building using the Reflexer infrastructure, with the support of the team. So it seems quite natural to consider an airdrop of the governance token of these new projects, including VOLT, to FLX holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last tip: the stakers of the FLX/ETH LP in the Reflexer Safety Module are the last resort to guarantee the solvency of the protocol. If I were to consider an airdrop to thank the Reflexer community, I would probably target them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;looksrare-looks-bet-on-nfts&#34;&gt;LooksRare (LOOKS): bet on NFTs
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of LOOKS as an option on the NFT market. In fact, LooksRare is the first NFT marketplace that shares revenue. This translates into &lt;strong&gt;an ETH yield for stakers on LOOKS that reached 3 digits sustained during the first few weeks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, trading volume has dropped and the ETH yield with it, but &lt;strong&gt;the staking LOOKS is still one of the biggest ETH yields out there&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll stop with these three suggestions, but of course there are other options - you be the judge. For example, the QI Wars have started and the protocol has good traction. Be careful, however, not to fall into the trap of thinking that all protocols that adopt the ve + bribes model will be as successful as Curve and Convex. ve tokenomics will multiply: it&amp;rsquo;s about making the right choices!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🎲 PoolTogether: The story of the no-loss lottery where everyone wins</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/pool-together/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/pool-together/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/cover-EN.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎲 PoolTogether: The story of the no-loss lottery where everyone wins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has enabled the emergence of an alternative financial system built on fundamentally different foundations: transparency, open-source, composability and resistance to censorship. Many use cases have emerged and it is now possible to buy and exchange tokens without a centralized intermediary, but also to lend or borrow and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of the day, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/pool-together-v5/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt;, goes one step further: it uses and assembles different DeFi services to offer a new kind of &amp;ldquo;money game&amp;rdquo;, which is more fun, but also more instructive and much less dangerous and harmful than its classic counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer you to explore this protocol in detail: we start with its context, before analyzing how it works and the different issues it involves. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context-limits-and-dangers-of-the-classic-lottery&#34;&gt;The context: limits and dangers of the classic lottery
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter is almost hard for me to write because it is seems so obvious, yet it is still very poorly perceived by the majority of people. Concretely from a societal point of view, the lottery is probably as deleterious as smoking. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By its design (possible and promoted jackpot), the &lt;strong&gt;lottery targets the most vulnerable populations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite this, the &lt;strong&gt;expectation of winning is negative&lt;/strong&gt;: players lose money while playing for most of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also &lt;strong&gt;serious consequences for the winners&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a complex experience and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/lottery-winners-lost-everything-2017-8?IR=T&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many end up broke after a few years&lt;/a&gt;. Regular gamblers also suffer from addiction problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lottery was wildly taxed and owned by the state&amp;hellip; until now. &lt;strong&gt;Privatization means giving the profits from an activity that is clearly harmful to society to private companies&lt;/strong&gt; - the comparison with smoking makes even more sense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, and this is not specific to the lottery but &lt;strong&gt;equally miserable, denounceable and pitiful&lt;/strong&gt;: gambling often targets the most vulnerable populations for their advertising and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/children-more-likely-to-become-gamblers-due-to-high-volume-of-betting-ads&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;and particularly on young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/winamax-pub.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;winamax-pub&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a look on the full film advertisement created by TBWA, France for Winamax &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/film/winamax_the_mama&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;addictions-dependencies-consequences&#34;&gt;Addictions, dependencies: consequences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is logical, mechanical and despairing: in the long term trend, bets are exploding despite a declining number of players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/evolution-2007-2017.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;stats-fdj&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject is complex and, like smoking, often documented and researched by the gambling service providers themselves. The numbers speak for themselves, however: about 17% of gamblers are potentially at risk of addiction or dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/addictions.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;addictions&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;In 2017, Internet gambling (lottery games, horse or sports betting and poker) accounted for 11.2% of total spending, a share that has been steadily increasing since its authorization in 2010&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; according to the French Observatory of Drugs and Addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other statistics are simply hopeless but ultimately understandable: &lt;strong&gt;the more social and economic misery increases, the more the promise of the lottery jackpot attracts the gullible&lt;/strong&gt;, thus increasing the privatized winnings of the FDJ (the operator of France&amp;rsquo;s national lottery games) and others, and destroying the social fabric ever more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll stop here, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have understood: when you get out of the studies financed by the FDJ or associated, you quickly realize the extent of the social break that the lottery causes. The 22.7% returned to the communities is clearly not enough to compensate the real costs of this &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; (ruined lives, addictions, suicides, broken families, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;promotion-of-a-deleterious-social-novel&#34;&gt;Promotion of a deleterious social novel?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish this picture that sets the context, I propose a last more subjective point: what about the impact of the lottery on the &lt;strong&gt;social novel&lt;/strong&gt;? The social novel is like the American dream: a fable that constitutes one of the foundations of the construction of the national identity (in this case: everyone can succeed in the US if they work hard enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a real collective delusion, but it contributes to &lt;strong&gt;defining the imaginary associated with success in a given society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me ask the question: what impact does the lottery have on our social novel? Again it is rather negative I think, because it feeds the fable that to be successful you have to be born into a good family, or &amp;ldquo;lucky&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; become a celebrity / play high level sports or lottery. &lt;strong&gt;The classic lottery thus feeds the emptiness of our contemporary aspirations:&lt;/strong&gt; one more factor contributing to the ambient mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we are done with that. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the heart of the matter and see how PoolTogether reshuffles the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basics-to-understand-the-concept&#34;&gt;The basics to understand the concept
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principle of PoolTogether is basically quite simple, but there are also many details and subtleties that need to be figured out to really understand what the protocol aims to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, there are different sources of return, for example a USDC owner, a stablecoin, can lend it to others to generate a return via a service like Aave or Compound. &lt;strong&gt;Basically, PoolTogether is a playful abstraction layer built on top of such a source of returns.&lt;/strong&gt; At a high level, it looks like something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players deposit USDC into the USDC pool on PoolTogether - and receive a corresponding token to recognize their deposit (PTaUSDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pool (set of smart contracts) deploys the assets in different strategies to produce a return. The return is collected and used to fund the winners&amp;rsquo; prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each USDC deposited in the pool (⇒ PTaUSDC) corresponds to a potential winning lottery ticket. Every day, an auditable random draw (ChainLink VRF) is held to determine the many winners, with 3 initial prize ranges: 10 PTaUSDC, 100 PTaUSDC or 2500 PTaUSDC jackpot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s this infrastructure that produces a return - and puts only the return into play that qualifies Pool Together as a &lt;strong&gt;no-loss&lt;/strong&gt; lottery. At any time, &lt;strong&gt;the player can stop playing: he will get back at least his initial committed capital&lt;/strong&gt;, if he has never won the lottery, or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to be very precise, the only cost of Pool Together is the &amp;ldquo;opportunity cost of capital&amp;rdquo;: the potential lost opportunity on the mobilized capital, which could theoretically produce a better return otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pooltogether-v3-the-pool-token-sponsors-and-community-pools&#34;&gt;PoolTogether v3: the POOL token, sponsors and community pools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two versions of PoolTogether are online: v3 and v4. The concept remains the same but the infrastructure has greatly evolved. So before we look at what v4 has brought, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the still relevant v3 and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;accessible here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update was released &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defirate.com/pooltogether-v3/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;in October 2020&lt;/a&gt; shortly before &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/pooltogether/introducing-pool-23b09f36db48&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the POOL token&lt;/a&gt;, in February 2021. It brings many improvements to the PoolTogether infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sponsoring-pools-and-reserve-factor&#34;&gt;Sponsoring Pools and Reserve Factor
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the schematic explanation of earlier is useful, two initial subtleties must be added: sponsorship pools and the governance-controlled reserve factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with &lt;strong&gt;sponsoring&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea is to allow &amp;ldquo;non-player capital&amp;rdquo; to increase player earnings: this capital contributes to the output produced, but has no chance of winning. At first this was envisaged from a rather voluntary perspective, but with the launch of the token sponsors are now eligible for POOL rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Reserve&lt;/strong&gt; system is even simpler: each pool has a &lt;em&gt;Reserve Factor&lt;/em&gt; which corresponds to a % of the return captured by the pool directly. These funds are used to guarantee the sustainability of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v3, we also saw the arrival of &lt;em&gt;Community Pools&lt;/em&gt;, pools created by the community directly on the tokens of their choice, as long as they have a source of return, as well as many other additions that were more or less successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33t-lootboxes--pooltogether-on-polygon&#34;&gt;3,3T, Lootboxes &amp;amp; PoolTogether on Polygon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Olympus DAO offers a &lt;em&gt;3,3 Together&lt;/em&gt;, where players stake their OHM rebase: every three days the rebase of all players is distributed to the three winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also had other innovative ideas in v3 but they didn&amp;rsquo;t catch on, mainly because of the gas costs of the mainnet. For example, each pool has its &lt;em&gt;Lootbox&lt;/em&gt; which allows anyone to add an arbitrary token as a prize or even an NFT! Just send it to the lootbox address and when the next prize is distributed the NFT/token is automatically sent to the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The v3 also marked the arrival of the POOL token a few months later and its airdrop which we will talk about below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, v3 also marked the arrival of PoolTogether on other channels like Polygon or BSC. Nevertheless this logic has its limits because it also leads to a fragmentation of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pooltogether-v4-tsunami-with-innovative-cross-chain-approach&#34;&gt;PoolTogether v4: Tsunami with innovative cross-chain approach
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The v4 is a very important iteration on the base proposed in v3. Here, the experience has been simplified and reworked to make it as accessible and fun as possible: and it works! Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-chain-egalitarian-approach&#34;&gt;Cross-chain egalitarian approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will detail this point because it is crucial, PoolTogether was a pioneer in this field and it is a dimension that we find on all projects: &lt;strong&gt;the cross-chain strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. It aims to offer the same service, whatever the channel used by the user. I&amp;rsquo;m coming to that, but before I do, let&amp;rsquo;s take the time to understand the classic cross-chain replication approach and its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-basic-approach-replication&#34;&gt;The basic approach: replication
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most projects simply &lt;strong&gt;replicate their service on all channels&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the case of Sushi for example, which is present on more than ten channels, but also Pool Together v3 as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has the merit of simplicity and allows access to the service on all covered channels - but it results in &lt;strong&gt;fragmentation of liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; which can make this service less qualitative on &amp;ldquo;small channels&amp;rdquo;. Thus PT v3 Polygon USDC players, now few in number, play for a weekly fee of $69. On the other hand PT v4 USDC players share a daily price of over $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tsunami&#34;&gt;Tsunami
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With PoolTogether v4 comes the so-called Tsunami model where all chains are equal. To do this, PoolTogether introduces an abstraction layer between all chains to redistribute prices if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows &lt;strong&gt;mutualizing depositors&amp;rsquo; funds across all chains&lt;/strong&gt; to offer one big attractive prize rather than multiplying pools and dividing prizes. One consequence is that players on Polygon (where the gas cost of depositing is marginal) can play with the same odds and payout expectation as mainnet players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course this requires more development and implementation work and there are consequences for players as well, the most notable being &lt;strong&gt;a one day delay between initial deposit and eligibility for the first draw&lt;/strong&gt;. But this is not too much of a trade-off considering the fact that PoolTogether is intended to be a game that promotes long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adjustment-of-the-pricing-model&#34;&gt;Adjustment of the pricing model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where v3 opted for flexibility, with pools having daily or weekly draws, the unique v4 pool can afford a &lt;strong&gt;daily draw&lt;/strong&gt; given its size. In addition, the prize structure has been revised to allocate more small prizes to make the experience a little less random in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/prize-breakdown-old.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;prize-breakdown-old&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jackpot logic is preserved with the first and only winner pocketing $2500 anyway, but there are also nearly 720 other potential winners with the $100 and $10 prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/winning.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tokenbrice-pooltogether-winning&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the number of winning players is lower because it is possible to win several prizes at once. However, this approach also smoothes out the income for large depositors, who frequently win $10 or $100 rewards, potentially even every day if the deposit is large enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distribution allows for frequent rewards for players who use PoolTogether for savings purposes while maintaining the spirit of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decent chance (depending on the size of the deposit) to have small winnings ($10 and $100 prizes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small chance of a massive payout: the $2500 jackpot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the prize model, the whole experience around prize allocation has been reviewed with v4. The governance has continued to iterate and recently voted on an overhaul of the prize structure: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-47-prize-adjustments/1752&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PTIP-47: Prize Adjustments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-more-satisfying-experience&#34;&gt;A more satisfying experience.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many settings and details have been adjusted to make the winning experience more fun and enjoyable. The complete list is on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.pooltogether.com/faq/v3-to-v4-differences&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the PoolTogether documentation&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;rsquo;ll just mention the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the winnings go into a &lt;strong&gt;claim logic&lt;/strong&gt;, where before they went directly into the wallet. This makes it easier for players to understand and quantify winnings. In addition, they are now paid out in PTaUSDC, the PoolTogether v4 lottery ticket, and are therefore &lt;strong&gt;automatically compounded&lt;/strong&gt;: winning increases your chances of winning, with a simple claim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/comparaison.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;comparison-pt-vs-savings&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Players have 60 days to claim their reward&lt;/strong&gt;, which guarantees a form of follow-up and commitment, but also allows an almost totally passive interaction with the protocol for those who wish to do so: deposit &amp;gt; every 59 days: claim &amp;gt; withdrawal when desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POOL token has been mentioned several times without digging into it: this was deliberate. Now that the system is clear to you, I propose to finish by analyzing its value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pool-token&#34;&gt;The POOL token
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will talk about airdrop of course, but also liquidity and of course governance: let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;airdrop-everybody-won&#34;&gt;Airdrop: everybody won!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To launch the most fun token of the DeFi, there couldn&amp;rsquo;t be anything else than an airdrop obviously. This is one of the retroactive airdrops that followed in the wake of Uniswap, but still came early enough that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly abused by the infamous airdrop hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14% of POOL&amp;rsquo;s total supply&lt;/strong&gt; was distributed to players who participated before January 14, 2021, with weighting based on deposit amount and duration. This was a nice surprise for early adopters, even with small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pool-incentives-and-lp-v3&#34;&gt;POOL incentives and LP (v3)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who says token also means most often incentives: PoolTogether is no exception to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the token came POOL incentives for all players; as well as adjustments to the sponsorship model described above. There is also a liquidity issue on the POOL token now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting with a classic incentive model for LPs, governance decided to explore a model that allows the protocol to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-40-olympus-lp-incentives-pool-pool-distribution/1638&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;control its own liquidity (PTIP-40&lt;/a&gt; through bonding (Ohm-like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;define-the-funtogether&#34;&gt;Define the &amp;ldquo;FunTogether&amp;rdquo;!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The POOL is used to take part in the protocol decisions and help to refine the model. Furthermore, the implementation of the governance itself is also fun. In order to vote, you have to deposit your POOL tokens in the POOL pool on PoolTogether: while having a basic return + chances to win prizes, players can thus vote on governance decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes call PoolTogether &amp;ldquo;the most fun protocol in the whole of DeFi&amp;rdquo;, a true statement but one that can be taken even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoolTogether governance, with its decisions, works to define what is &amp;ldquo;optimal fun&amp;rdquo;, with very concrete questions, like the number of prizes or their distribution. With the launch of v4, the number of prizes has greatly increased, allowing more players to win: more than half of the unique wallets playing PTv4 have won at least once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good start, but there&amp;rsquo;s probably room to refine the model even further to delight more players by positively promoting long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read me this far, would you like some more alpha?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoolTogether&amp;rsquo;s lossless logic is exported beyond the lottery / savings&lt;/strong&gt;. Many social mechanisms and games around money can be involved: sports betting, prediction markets, insurance, etc. The lossless family will be large, and PoolTogether already knows a first cousin that tackles predictions markets: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.entropyfi.com/user-guide/game-explained&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Place your bets,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;(🎲,🎲) and have fun :) [web3]&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is still a unique protocol: it allows borrowing on ETH and mint of a stablecoin (LUSD) without requiring governance which makes it &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is not always well understood, so let&amp;rsquo;s make it clear: the contracts necessary for the existence of Liquity and LUSD have been deployed and since they have no administrative functions, &lt;strong&gt;nothing can stop them as long as the Ethereum network is synchronizing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s not enough to excite your curiosity, the good news is that to achieve such a result, Liquity implements several new ideas that are really relevant. Indeed, in addition to its resilience, Liquity is also &lt;strong&gt;the least expensive&lt;/strong&gt; protocol for long term borrowing on ETH and also &lt;strong&gt;the most permissive in leverage&lt;/strong&gt;, outside of recovery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is therefore to introduce Liquity while expliciting several critical dimensions for any loan/money market service in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation-of-the-protocol&#34;&gt;OPERATION OF THE PROTOCOL
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose an exhaustive tour of the protocol to understand the issues and contributions made to DeFi. Ideally, it would be to understand all the dynamics. However, I realize that my explanations can sometimes be dense, so I will offer them by level of complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-liquitys-fundamentals&#34;&gt;🏗 Liquity&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, Liquity works in a similar logic to Maker: users create &amp;ldquo;Troves&amp;rdquo; where they can deposit ETH in order to borrow stablecoins, LUSD, directly from the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;money-market-or-loan-service&#34;&gt;Money market or loan service?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Liquity and Maker are borrowing services but not money markets. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Who is lending to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either the protocol directly (borrowing service),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or other users via a pooling model like Aave or Compound (money market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is extremely important in terms of the competitiveness of the protocol: &lt;strong&gt;it is almost impossible, even theoretically, to envision a money market offering low stablecoin borrowing costs (&amp;lt;3 or 4% annual) on a sustainable basis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because money markets need to offer an attractive return to their stablecoin depositors, who have many, many alternatives for generating returns. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;if efficiency is a key objective, the borrowing service model that does not require deposits from other users is inherently more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; - the user borrows directly from the protocol at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s test the theory against the hard absurdity of practice: these considerations are valid for analyzing the design of a money market / borrowing service. There are &lt;strong&gt;borrowing services (which are supposed to be very efficient) which nevertheless manage to be expensive for borrowers, like MakerDAO&lt;/strong&gt;. The reasons for this are various, but the fact that the DAO still decides on the protocol fees (potentially in a totally arbitrary way) seems to me to be one of the main ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;borrowing-with-liquity&#34;&gt;Borrowing with Liquity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a potential user&amp;rsquo;s point of view, Liquity basically works as an alternative to Maker or something else: the user arrives with ETH that he deposits in his trove to mint the desired amount of LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the parallel stops here because although at a high level the process is similar, the underlying logic is totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;fees-management&#34;&gt;Fees management
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the crux of the matter: borrowing costs. On this subject and in addition to very low absolute borrowing costs, Liquity has the merit of bringing &lt;strong&gt;predictability and clarity.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, where Maker, Aave and Compound for example practice a variable annual rate (via governance for Maker, market conditions for Aave/Compound), &lt;strong&gt;at Liquity the rate is fixed and clearly announced at the time of the loan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, at Liquity the fees are paid in one go, at the time of the loan&amp;rsquo;s implementation: these are the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;initiation fees&amp;rdquo;, by default at 0.5%&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the only fee that the borrower pays, even if he keeps his trove for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/trove.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquity-trove&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Liquity is &lt;strong&gt;ideal for long term positions&lt;/strong&gt;, such borrowing costs are effectively 5-10x lower than what you can find on the main alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;stability-pool-liquidations-backstop&#34;&gt;Stability pool: liquidations backstop
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Liquity&amp;rsquo;s model already provides relevant benefits from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, its design also explores relevant solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues for borrowing services is of course that the protocol remains solvent: there are therefore, if necessary, liquidations to restore the balance. Liquidation of positions requires equity and a certain infrastructure when it is the users who do it directly, as on Marker or Aave. To optimize the process, the idea of a liquidity &amp;ldquo;backstop&amp;rdquo; has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is about having &lt;strong&gt;a reserve of funds, generally stablecoins that the protocol uses if necessary to manage liquidations&lt;/strong&gt;: it is the Stability Pool on Liquity. The users who wish to do so can deposit their LUSD in this pool: they are remunerated in LQTY (which we will detail next).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds in the Stability Pool are used when necessary for liquidations. As the system is now quite mature, liquidations tend to happen mostly in case of a sharp drop in the ETH price. A position in the Stability Pool therefore allows one to profit from these juicy liquidations without having the skills or infrastructure to execute them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stability Pool thus offers a rather gas-light and attractive native return option on the LUSD. With a conservative collateralization ratio, it may even be suitable for an almost entirely passive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the backstop concept is not implemented natively in the other major money markets, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the B.Protocol project&lt;/a&gt; acts as an abstraction layer offering the equivalent of this service to Maker, Aave and Compound (without the benefits of having it in-house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lqty-token--staking&#34;&gt;LQTY token &amp;amp; staking
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told you above: Liquity has no governance. The system automatically adjusts itself according to different parameters observed on the markets as we will see below. But then, what is the purpose of LQTY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most basic form, it is an accounting mechanism for allocating the revenues generated by the protocol. LQTY can be staked to obtain LUSD corresponding to its share of the initiation fee and ETH from the redemption fee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lqty-staking-returns.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;lqty-staking-returns&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for the essential points about Liquity and its main differences with the existing solutions. However, as always, the devil is in the details, so now that the basics are established, I propose to explore the arcana of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-complete-understanding-and-advanced-use&#34;&gt;🧙 Complete understanding and advanced use
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have stayed as much as possible in the perspective of a potential user. For this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to broaden our horizons to understand the subtleties of Liquity&amp;rsquo;s design. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;risks--limits&#34;&gt;Risks &amp;amp; limits
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have your attention, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about risks: this is also part of the subtleties to understand and take advantage of Liquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;-dependence-on-the-oracle&#34;&gt;🔮 Dependence on the oracle
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading me for a while, this sentence will probably tell you something: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;the truth about money markets is what the oracle says&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The oracle is the device that allows to obtain the necessary data on-chain, to be used by smart contracts. The critical data in question here is the price of ETH in USD, which determines whether a given position is solvent or needs to be liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the choice is classic: the main stream used is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ETH/USD ChainLink&lt;/a&gt;, with a fallback to Tellor (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations#what-oracle-are-you-using-to-determine-the-price-of-eth&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;). ChainLink is very widespread and robust, but one has to be aware of the fact that a problem with the ETH/USD ChainLink stream can quickly lead to serious consequences on Liquity (and pretty much the whole DeFi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;-the-lusd-against-its-1-peg&#34;&gt;⚖ The LUSD against its $1 peg
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD is a stablecoin, it&amp;rsquo;s great to mine it directly to push down borrowing costs as much as possible. But what about the stability of the LUSD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoin pegging is a pretty dense science, so we won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily go into detail, just the basics. The LUSD has various characteristics that allow it to establish a floor and a ceiling via arbitrage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floor: the redemption mechanism: an LUSD can be redeemed against ETH via a mechanism that we will explore next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceiling: the protocol guarantees an absolute minimum collateralization of LUSD with ETH at 110% under all conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, although the LUSD is holding its peg at $1 relatively well, the fluctuations in amplitude are more consistent than on a centralized stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lusd-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;lusd-price&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--Différentes situations extrêmes au niveau du marché (et donc du protocole) peuvent également amener à envisager un LUSD qui s&#39;écarte plus ou moins durablement du peg. Dans l&#39;ensemble, les mécanismes de stabilisation sont là pour ramener l&#39;équilibre sur le long-terme.--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various extreme situations in the market (and therefore in the protocol) can also lead to the possibility of an LUSD that deviates more or less permanently from the peg. On the whole, the stabilization mechanisms are there to bring back the balance in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-protocol-level-game&#34;&gt;A &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo; game
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity brings us to a very interesting notion that I call &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo;, for lack of a better word. It is about the possible interactions with the protocol whose consequences depend on the actions of the other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way and to use my favorite metaphor of MMORPGs :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvE = Player versus Environment (AI)&lt;/strong&gt;, in DeFi: simple farming &amp;amp; consequences of other players only secondary (e.g. dilution of yield when a 🐳 happens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvP = Player versus Player&lt;/strong&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s not missing even in DeFi!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the most interesting thing today is &lt;strong&gt;RvR (Realm vs Realm)&lt;/strong&gt;. Here again there is fighting between players, but it is &lt;strong&gt;a structured fight by faction&lt;/strong&gt;, with objectives to reach. The DeFi equivalent here is of course the CRV game on Curve!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see on Liquity some &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo; mechanics that could be similar to RvR in this metaphor, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how they work :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;dynamic-initiationredemption-rate&#34;&gt;Dynamic initiation/redemption rate
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the most basic: fees. I mentioned above that the initiation fee is 0.5%: this is true, but slightly simplified. In reality this rate can vary between 0.5% and 5%: it is the &lt;code&gt;baseRate&lt;/code&gt; that governs the fee paid on both loans and redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Liquity is used heavily, the &lt;code&gt;baseRate&lt;/code&gt; increases. This is also a defensive mechanism for the protocol, which otherwise could be &amp;ldquo;emptied&amp;rdquo; of ETH by arbitrageurs (massive redemption LUSD-&amp;gt;ETH). The &amp;ldquo;decay&amp;rdquo; rate when the use calms down to come back nicely to 0.5% and I let you go see &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/lusd-redemptions#how-is-the-baserate-calculated&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the math behind it&lt;/a&gt; on the doc for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;recovery-mode-as-terrifying-as-it-is-effective&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Recovery Mode&amp;rdquo;: as terrifying as it is effective?
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal use, &lt;strong&gt;Liquity is the most permissive protocol for leveraging on ETH, tolerating a collateralization ratio as low as 110%&lt;/strong&gt; (~90% of the net collateral value is borrowed). This is out of line with what is found elsewhere in DeFi, some references on ETH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maker offers collateralization ratios ranging from 58.8% for ETH-C to 76.9% for ETH-B (min collateral ratio of 130% to 170%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave is at 82.5% on ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound at 75%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the protocol can be so permissive, it is not because it takes more risks, but rather because several solutions are implemented to push users to re-collateralize when necessary: recovery mode and redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/recovery-mode.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;recovery-mode&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery mode is a protocol-level game on Liquity: its triggering depends on the &amp;ldquo;Total Collateral Ratio&amp;rdquo; of the protocol: the ratio between the total collateral and the LUSD due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this ratio falls &lt;strong&gt;below 150%, the Recovery Mode is activated to restore the balance&lt;/strong&gt;: the minimum collateralization threshold for a trove falls to 110%. Risky users are thus invited to re-collateralize or pay off debt - and/or will be liquidated if necessary when the recovery mode is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery mode is not a surprise, however, since it depends on a parameter that everyone can easily follow. Such a system makes it possible to maximize the efficiency of the protocol most of the time, while quickly reverting to more conservative settings if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-redemption-game&#34;&gt;The redemption game
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is one last mechanism to detail: redemptions, an arbitrage mechanism to exchange LUSD for ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a protocol-level game: redemptions are made using the liquidity available in the users&amp;rsquo; troves. &lt;strong&gt;When there is a redemption, the protocol starts by using the liquidity of the least collateralized trove on Liquity&lt;/strong&gt; and goes up as much as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, being &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; least collateralized trove on Liquity is not a very enviable position, since your collateral is at risk of being used for redemptions. If this is the case, the user will lose ETH, but they will also see their debt decrease (in proportion to the LUSDs traded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism pushes players to remain reasonable, even when the recovery mode is not activated: to avoid redemptions, one should not be the most aggressive. It is a sort of &lt;strong&gt;regulation mechanism whose exact threshold depends on the average leverage appetite of the other players&lt;/strong&gt;: in other words, a very elegant design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;decentralized-front-ends&#34;&gt;Decentralized front-ends
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this may be a detail for you but for me it means a lot: &lt;strong&gt;the Liquity team does not operate the application site&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, they have made available a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/sdk&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frontend SDK&lt;/a&gt; to help other developers operate an instance of a Liquity frontend themselves. There is also a kickback mechanism to encourage these integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach allows Liquity to go even &lt;strong&gt;further than other protocols in terms of decentralization&lt;/strong&gt; and to offer solid guarantees that at least one of the front-ends will remain available no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness is just like the rest of the protocol: innovative, different, and truly relevant that you simply can&amp;rsquo;t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-and-lusd-in-the-defi-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Liquity and LUSD in the DeFi ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article because I see Liquity as an essential DeFi primitive and I&amp;rsquo;d like to help you understand why. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who understands what&amp;rsquo;s at stake here, many protocols are interested in Liquity and LUSD in one way or another. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defi-liquity-integrations&#34;&gt;DeFi Liquity Integrations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are the various protocols that integrate one or more parts of Liquity and thus offer new opportunities to LQTY or LUSD owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;liquity-lusdlqty-and-farming&#34;&gt;Liquity LUSD/LQTY and farming
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest Finance&lt;/a&gt; offers an LQTY vault based on staking: the LUSD and ETH obtained are frequently composed of more LQTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.pickle.finance/farms&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pickle Finance&lt;/a&gt; proposes a similar product (pJar 0.98l) as well as a particular vault in partnership with B.Protocol to maximize the obtained LQTY:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/pickle-lusd.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pickle-lusd&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main source of liquidity for LUSD is the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/lusd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve Pool&lt;/a&gt;, also available with Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/visor-uni-lqty.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;visor-uni-lqty&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity is also supported on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, to manage leverage more easily and protect troves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the quick overview of the main integrations. DAOs are also interested in LUSD because it is the only unstoppable stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-a-dao-cash-snack&#34;&gt;LUSD: A DAO cash snack?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD&amp;rsquo;s inherent properties have already earned it some attention in DeFi. For example, after accumulating a lot of liquidity on DAI and FRAX, Olympus turned to LUSD with the accumulation of LUSD and LP Sushi LUSD/OHM via the bond mechanism. LUSD is now one of the main assets owned by OlympusDAO (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-%28OHM%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/olympus-lusd.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;olympus-lusd&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ohmies are not going to stop there: they love productive assets, and Liquity is not lacking in them: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/177-tap-5-whitelist-liquity-lusd-stability-pool-and-lqty-staking&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; is therefore that the protocol deploys its LUDS in the Stability Pool to accumulate LQTYs which will also be staked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was even classic liquidity mining on the LUSD/OHM pair, but revisited. With Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://crucible.alchemist.wtf/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Crucible &lt;/a&gt;a smart contract wallet NFT to easily manage LP positions, a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/how-to-earn-rewards-on-the-lusd-ohm-pool-using-alchemists-crucible&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;35 day program &lt;/a&gt;was offered, with rewards in OHM, LUSD and MIST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other protocols seeking resilience, diversification and stability for their cash flow have also taken the plunge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fei, a protocol offering a different type of stablecoin, has diversified its collateral into LUSD and now has over 50M LUSD: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.fei.money/analytics&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Analytics Fei Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Synthetix team is also interested in bringing the LUSD onto Optimism, which could help stabilize the LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/token/0x5f98805A4E8be255a32880FDeC7F6728C6568bA0#balances&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The top holder LUSD &lt;/a&gt; already has several DAOs and &lt;strong&gt;as with RAI&lt;/strong&gt; I think the trend may grow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lusd-holders.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;lusd-holders&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other integrations are still possible, like for example the direct integration of the stability pool on a pool fuse to allow a more optimal use of the stability pool&amp;rsquo;s assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has aroused your curiosity: Liquity has been available since last April and yet very few people realize the elegance and minimalism of this protocol that offers credible solutions to real challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, there are no secrets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/curve-wars-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of Curve Finance and the launch of the CRV token, we have been waiting, contemplating and assuming what the CRV war could bring. Now, with the launch of Convex, then Bribe.crv and finally Votium, everything is accelerating: VeCRV votes can now be bought! So let&amp;rsquo;s see how this impacts Curve and DeFi as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the question is quite simple and straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve is the largest decentralized DeFi exchange in terms of total value deposited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CRV token provides access to 1/ a share of the fees collected 2/ &lt;strong&gt;a voting power to influence the issuance of future CRVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;=&amp;gt; Having control over a large CRV voting power makes it &lt;strong&gt;much easier to develop a Curve pool&lt;/strong&gt;, since it offers the possibility to vote for large CRV returns on the pool in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as often in DeFi, everything is not so simple and the devil is in the details. To understand the stakes of the CRV war, you need to have &lt;strong&gt;a good understanding of the different tools built on it&lt;/strong&gt;. This will allow you to judge the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects that seek to influence Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convex-and-the-vecrv-separation&#34;&gt;Convex and the VeCRV separation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing the battlefields - i.e. the different tools used in this CRV war - we need to look more deeply at one in particular: Convex. I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it on this blog, explaining &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-flywheel.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the flywheel dimension of Convex with the CvxCRV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions of Convex with Curve go far beyond the CvxCRV, which is only one element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;strong&gt;one could describe Convex as a separation between governance and returns on VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; by amplifying each of the elements on a separate token. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cvxcrv--vecrv-yield&#34;&gt;CvxCRV = VeCRV-yield++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a VeCRV owned by Convex. They are locked in forever, but the liquidity available on CvxCRV/CRV allows depositors to close out their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of governance, CvxCRV loses all its capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; : VeCRV owner can vote on gauges (CRV issue) and governance votes. A CvxCRV owner has no other benefit than the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;the return is amplified compared to a simple possession of VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in 3pool token - the share of fees collected on Curve - exactly like VeCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in CRV (10% of all CRV farmed by Convex shared between all CvxCRV stakers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually the same yield in CVX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential airdrops like Ellipsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a simple compromise compared to VeCRV: governance capabilities are lost (-&amp;gt; vlCVX) but in return the performance is greatly amplified and diversified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vlcvx--vecrv-gov&#34;&gt;vlCVX = VeCRV-gov++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Convex offers another interesting abstraction from Curve. It is its native CVX token. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;each CVX corresponds to a VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; voting capability (which comes from CvxCRV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mobilize it, the depositor must &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; his CVX in vlCVX. They are locked for 16 weeks + 3 days and so provide access to governance capacity. Currently, vlCVX is by far the most economically efficient way to accrue Curve voting capacity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Price
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Voting power
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV-vote/$
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Commitment
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$2.42
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1 veCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;0.41
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 years
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;vlCVX
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$8.2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;12,75 VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1.55
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;16 weeks + 3 days
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increased profitability of CVX to influence Curve, the commitment is also less than on VeCRV. For the comparison table, I assumed a 4-year lock on CRV. The difference is even more in favor of vlCVX for shorter commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribes-a-not-so-clean-separation&#34;&gt;Bribes: a not so clean separation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation was clear, but it did not remain so for long. Indeed, it should first be noted that vlCVX is not without returns: &lt;strong&gt;vlCVX owners share 6% of all CRVs farmed by Convex, in the form of CvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this is potentially not the only return for which vlCVX owners are eligible. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;governance capacity can also offer a substantial return via bribe mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; (vote buying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different projects offer incentives for voting on the gauge of a given Pool Curve. For example, Alchemix offers rewards in ALCX, its native token, which can be claimed each week by all those who used their VeCRV to vote to increase the CRV allocation of the AlUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, it is not impossible that the initial separation planned by Convex is not the most honest. Currently, the yield on cvxCRV is about 60% while it is only 15% on CVX. Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;when you add the bribes into the equation, it is not impossible that the yield on vlCVX is much higher than on cvxCRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-battlefields&#34;&gt;The battlefields
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bribes&amp;rdquo; services are an essential part of the Curve governance equation. However, before digging into them, we need to recall the basic path (veCRV) that defines the framework for all its variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeCRV is obtained by locking CRV for up to 4 years. The longer the lock, the closer the VeCRV/CRV ratio is to 1. &lt;strong&gt;The lock gradually depletes over time as does the voting capacity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why vaults built on VeCRV operate on a 4-year perpetual locking logic: in order to preserve a voting capacity that is always as close to the maximum possible, &lt;strong&gt;they &amp;ldquo;refresh&amp;rdquo; the locking frequently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribe-v0--direct-incentive-on-pools&#34;&gt;Bribe v0 : direct incentive on pools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about bribes, it is worth remembering there is a primitive form that has been available since the early days of Curve: additional incentives (on top of CRVs) for liquidity providers. Synthetix pioneered this with the SNX liquidity mining program on the sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct incentives can be combined with bribes, and are even recommended. We will see below how MIM, for example, obtained much more activity by sharing its budget between incentives and bribes (after an initial phase without bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribecrv-by-cronje-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Bribe.crv by Cronje [with veCRV]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &amp;ldquo;bribes&amp;rdquo; are purchases of VeCRV votes. They are paid by the week, generally on Friday (the day the votes are taken into account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just as there are several systems for interacting with VeCRV, there are also several mechanisms for bribes. So we start with the one that was available first: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bribe.crv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://bribe.crv.finance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic unit is the VeCRV. Bribe.crv is a simple interface that summarizes the different offers and allows to collect its bribes. Voting is done directly on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a somewhat timid start, the service is being used more and more and many projects are now proposing bribes. The returns in the first few weeks have been excellent, it remains to be seen if they will last. For example, I got &lt;strong&gt;about 10% return on my VeCRV (/ current price) in 5 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; by voting for the MIM pool and receiving SPELL tokens in bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to the results below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-with-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Votium [with vlCVX]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative available is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the basic unit is the vlCVX, so the two services are not competitors but complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Votium is more recent so the available bribes are more limited. On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;Votium already controls an impressive voting power: about 8M CVX or more than 102M VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is potentially more passive than with bribe.crv since depositors can delegate to Votium who will take care of voting each week for them and collect the corresponding bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with an active delegation, a depositor can at any time take back control and vote for a given pool, directly on snapshot (-&amp;gt; no gas cost). The system is therefore more flexible than bribe.crv in this respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services to handle bribes are also in development with a release in the near future. So far the bribe game has focused mainly on CRV, but &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.paladin.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, intends to offer a similar mechanism with other protocols as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-into-practice-tactics-and-results&#34;&gt;Putting it into practice: tactics and results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual bases are a bit heavy on this subject, but it is essential to understand them. To make it more explicit, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the practical side with concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spellmim-case&#34;&gt;The Spell/MIM case
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://abracadabra.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Abracadabra&lt;/a&gt; is a Maker service. Various assets are accepted as collateral, including productive assets such as xSUSHI or cvx3pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Maker produces DAI, Abracadabra produces a stablecoin (on the dollar) called MIM. The liquidity available on MIM, as well as the opportunity for returns, is therefore a key factor in the platform&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Abracadabra has progressively gone through all forms of direct or indirect bribes on Curve :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It started with a SPELL incentive (governance token) on the Curve/MIM pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When bribe.crv arrived, &lt;strong&gt;a portion of that incentive was reallocated to bribe&lt;/strong&gt; - thus distributed to veCRV owners who vote for the MIM gauge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, with the arrival of vlCVX, the team is considering reallocating the budget through this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, the MIM pool has exploded on Curve, at all levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV yields were really good in some weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has attracted liquidity and volume, slightly reducing the yield but increasing the ability to boost the pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result of this momentum, MIM is now the fifth largest pool curve in terms of volume, with a nice volume/TVL ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/crv-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pool is now well balanced and rather dense (&amp;gt; $700M total liquidity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example of Abracadabra is extremely instructive, as it demonstrates the relevance of the abstractions built on VeCRV: &lt;strong&gt;without increasing its total budget, Abracadabra has been able to attract much more liquidity than at the time of the simple direct incentive in SPELL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You therefore understand that DeFi projects that take advantage of the veCRV, cvxCRV and vlCVX mechanisms have an undeniable advantage (&lt;strong&gt;economic AND political&lt;/strong&gt;) over those who have not yet grasped all their subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sdvecrv-vs-cvxcrv&#34;&gt;sdveCRV VS cvxCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;I now consider understanding Curve and the ability to effectively influence its governance to be an essential and required capability in most DeFi projects, especially for stablecoin projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to take my word for it though, let&amp;rsquo;s compare in practice two approaches implemented by projects with similar issues: liquidity strategies on cvxCRV (from Convex) and sdveCRV (from StakeDAO) - two abstractions built on veCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the situations are similar, there are some important differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by recalling that Convex controls more than 30 times the amount of CRV controlled by Stake (102M vs 3M).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, sdveCRV has serious problems with its peg: 1 sdveCRV ~= 0.5 CRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/sdvecrv-peg.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sdvecrv-peg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sdvecrv-liquidity-plan-total-misunderstanding-and-abject-failure&#34;&gt;sdveCRV liquidity plan: total misunderstanding and abject failure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the analysis. Initially the liquidity of sdveCRV was against ETH just like Yearn. Since Convex, the Stake team is trying to react to make sdveCRV more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team clearly did not take the time to analyze the situation and rushed into what turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;one of the biggest governance failures ever seen on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating an anemic sdveCRV/CRV pool via the Curve Factory, a vote was taken to add the gauge control (= CRV incentives). Not only was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/83&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the vote overwhelmingly rejected&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;the sdveCRV pool is set up in an aberrant and absolutely dangerous way for depositors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the factor A (amplification parameter) of the pool is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/34&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;set to 200&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a correct value for assets that follow the same peg, but &lt;strong&gt;delusional if one asset is worth twice the other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/sdvecrv-mim-crv-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sdvecrv-mim-crv-pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea, even the aforementioned absolutely massive MIM pool (7000x the liquidity of the sdveCRV pool) has not yet reached 200 of A factor (119 currently, increasing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, not only did Stake fail to solve its liquidity problem on sdveCRV, but &lt;strong&gt;such a course of events clearly raises the question of the Stake team&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the intricacies of Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get sdveCRV back to peg and develop its liquidity, they will need a lot of effort, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the pool parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct incentives in SDT on the pool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these steps are completed, the team would then have a chance to get the CRV gauge on this pool, but not before. So the current situation looks like a costly dead end: &lt;strong&gt;no way out unless the SDT board is heated (even more)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cvxcrv-liquidity-plan-immediate-take-off&#34;&gt;cvxCRV liquidity plan: immediate take-off
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the liquidity plan on cvxCRV demonstrates how effective the process can be. Initially (and still today), the main pool for cvxCRV is on Sushiswap, against CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation does not really make sense: &lt;strong&gt;Sushi is far from optimal for optimizing liquidity across assets that follow the same peg&lt;/strong&gt;. So when Curve launched factory pools (V2), the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cvxCRV/CRV pool&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note here the A Factor at 50 - while cvxCRV holds its peg much better than sdveCRV&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any incentive from Convex or Curve, the pool has already seen significant volume flow through DEX aggregators like Paraswap. Soon, there was a vote to add the CRV gauge which passed - and this pool is now farmable directly through Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool remains slightly unbalanced (there is so much to do with CRVs, which are becoming increasingly rare&amp;hellip;) but it already brings a competitive alternative to the SLP cvxCRV/CRV pool with still a fraction of its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you grasp the intricacies of the extended veCRV ecosystem and their implications for the CRV battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before concluding, I would like to remind you that as usual the alpha is in the nooks and crannies. If you have understood this article, feel free to export the liquidity strategy analysis to other projects: I am sure it will be instructive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you often, but it will never be enough: not only Curve is the most important DEX in DeFi but it is also &lt;strong&gt;the most advanced protocol in terms of governance and tokenomics by far compared to anything else&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you have no interest in Curve/Convex, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand these protocols in order to properly consider what&amp;rsquo;s going on in DeFi&amp;hellip; Hopefully this article will help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🗿 Reflexer Labs (RAI) : the What, How and Why</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/reflexer-rai/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🗿 Reflexer Labs (RAI) : the What, How and Why" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a strange beast that many people still don&amp;rsquo;t understand or care about, including people who are really knowledgeable about DeFi. So it was time to offer you a rather exhaustive article dedicated to its subject. I&amp;rsquo;ve included everything I thought was relevant to understand why an asset like RAI is needed, what it does and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get a cup of coffee and hang on, we&amp;rsquo;re in for a great ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-rais-context&#34;&gt;Understanding RAI&amp;rsquo;s context
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we even begin to get into the nitty-gritty, I think it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand the context around RAI, i.e. the main stable assets used today and their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context for understanding RAI is quite dense, but the good news is that this is not the first time I have covered this topic on the blog. So I&amp;rsquo;ll refer you to some relevant reading to go deeper into the subject :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-innovations.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Understanding innovations in money markets to envision their future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to explore the concept in depth with the articles proposed above, here are the two essential points to remember to fully understand the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;strong&gt;the overwhelming majority of the stablecoin demand is covered by centralized solutions requiring trust&lt;/strong&gt;, the most used being USDT (~66 billion) and USDC (~27 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your preferred economic theses, especially in terms of inflation, I think we can easily agree on the need for stable assets that are not correlated to a fiduciary currency (= managed by a state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wusdc-trick&#34;&gt;The wUSDC trick
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the term &amp;ldquo;wrapped USDC&amp;rdquo; (wUSDC) to describe a situation that is common in alternative stablecoins: it is used to concisely and appropriately describe &lt;strong&gt;solutions that essentially use USDC as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, a trusted stablecoin guaranteed by a central agency (Circle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, there is no need to go further, not even to analyze the details of the system: since their main collateral can be frozen or seized, &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins produced&lt;/strong&gt; in this way cannot be considered decentralized or trustless.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of assets has a surprisingly large following, the main ones being Maker and Frax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maker--a-majority-of-collateral-requiring-trust&#34;&gt;Maker = a majority of collateral requiring trust
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/sky/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker (DAI)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;approximately 60% of DAI are minted with USDC as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, to which figure we need to add those minted from other collaterals requiring trust: wBTC, TUSD, GUSD, PAX, USDT, renBTC + all UniV2 pairs involving at least one of these tokens + all collaterals from the real world such as Centrifuge: New Silver. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://daistats.com/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Details on DAIStats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;dai-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: PSM is a module that prevents excessive price volatility of DAI. It is therefore automatically minted by the PSM when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of Maker, before the Multi Collateral DAI update (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@MakerDAO/update-the-road-to-multi-collateral-dai-2d4c48092270&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MCD - 18/11/2019&lt;/a&gt;) used only ETH as collateral and thus presented much more credible guarantees. This is no longer the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙏 Nevertheless, I warmly thank the MakerDAO team for their very many contributions to the ecosystem - the Maker MCD model is even used as a basis by Reflexer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;frax--guaranteed-by-usdc-or-nothing-algorithmic&#34;&gt;FRAX ? Guaranteed by USDC or nothing (algorithmic)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the FRAX side, only USDC is used as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, in various forms - either in Yearn/Compound/Aave to produce a return, or via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AMOs (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller)&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the details of the assets that are used to collateralize FRAX, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.frax.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;available on the official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/frax-collateral.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;frax-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Frax and DAI are developing a myriad of interesting approaches, but since their basis is centralized, &lt;strong&gt;they cannot be considered anything more than a mechanism for amplifying the liquidity available on USDC, at best&lt;/strong&gt;. They do, however, make &lt;strong&gt;interesting contributions in terms of fundamental research&lt;/strong&gt; that may help establish a more optimal solution that does not require trustlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-there-relevant-alternatives-to-rai&#34;&gt;Are there relevant alternatives to RAI?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, RAI is a unique asset with no comparable alternative. However, there are systems that share certain characteristics with RAI, such as &lt;strong&gt;the exclusive use of ETH as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are ready to expose yourself to the dollar, Liquity offers a very relevant alternative which also has &lt;strong&gt;the merit of being totally unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt; (which is not yet the case with RAI): the contracts have no administrative function, exactly like Uniswap V1/V2. However, there are still the oracles (necessary for a loan service) and the associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the stage is set, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the main course: it&amp;rsquo;s time to study the underlying mechanisms of RAI. We&amp;rsquo;ll start by how to mint it from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective before going into more detail about what RAI actually is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-rai-created-&#34;&gt;How is the RAI created ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI is in some ways &lt;strong&gt;both the primary and final form of Maker&amp;rsquo;s DAI&lt;/strong&gt;. First, in the sense that it returns to the promises of the original DAI (the SAI): only the ETH is used as collateral, and final in the sense that RAI manages to extricate itself from the dollar dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflexer is based on a Maker MCD with several changes, including the incorporation of the PID controller, protection against liquidations and many others. We will slowly unfold all this but let&amp;rsquo;s start by seeing how the system works from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on Maker, RAI is created directly by Reflexer users. Users can open &lt;strong&gt;a safe that allows them to stake ETH and mine a proportional amount of RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. Each user can choose the amount of RAI minted for the same amount of ETH at stake (-&amp;gt; different risk levels) and must manage his position. &lt;strong&gt;Liquidation is possible and necessary&lt;/strong&gt; because it ensures that there is always enough ETH in the system to guarantee the RAI issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the system here is innovating compared to Maker thanks to its &amp;ldquo;Savior&amp;rdquo; function. It allows &lt;strong&gt;to use a RAI/ETH liquidity position on Uniswap V2 as a guarantee for a safe&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, if the ETH price were to fall suddenly, which could put an open safe protected by this function at risk of liquidation, &lt;strong&gt;the Savior automatically withdraws the quantity of liquidity necessary to bring the safe back to the desired collateralization level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows users who mint RAI and then use it to provide liquidity to sleep much more peacefully!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-is-rai-exactly-&#34;&gt;But what is RAI exactly ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a new asset class in its own way. It aims to be &lt;strong&gt;low volatility, without relying on another stable asset&lt;/strong&gt; (fiat currency or gold are the most traditional sources). To do this, RAI relies on a system that reacts dynamically to market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of RAI, there are two key parameters to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The redemption price&lt;/strong&gt; = value of a unit of debt in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market price&lt;/strong&gt; = everything is in the name !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the system has no control over the RAI price observed in the market, which is determined by buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, it can gradually adjust certain parameters to modify the redemption price and &lt;strong&gt;converge the two prices in the future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are therefore faced with a situation that can be generalized quite easily, embodied by an entire field of engineering and called &lt;strong&gt;control theory&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/control-theory.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;control-theory&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of RAI, &lt;strong&gt;the controller is algorithmic&lt;/strong&gt; and again quite standard: it is the famous &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;PID controller &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is based on a fairly dense mathematical formula that it is not necessary to understand in order to understand the relevance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one essential point must be understood: the inherent inertia of the system. The controller cannot afford to make sudden changes in the parameters (which would be detrimental to its relative stability), so it must operate in a more iterative and progressive logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is understood, let me remind you that the system by itself cannot affect the price of RAI. All it can do is vary the redemption rate, which modulates the incentives of system participants. This creates &lt;strong&gt;arbitrage opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; for those participants whose execution brings them closer to the equilibrium between the redemption price and the market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a logic here that is reminiscent of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;algorithmic stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;, although the end product of the system is totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-market-price--redemption-price&#34;&gt;When market price &amp;gt; redemption price
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start with this situation because I think it is simpler to understand. In the case where the market price exceeds the redemption price, that means anyone with ETH available could potentially generate a profit by arbitraging the market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH deposit and RAI mint;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sale of RAI in the market for a profit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(When market price &amp;lt; redemption) repurchase of RAI to pay off debt and release ETH. The difference between the 2 prices on RAI - fees in gas is the profit generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/marchesupredemption-en.PNG&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;marchesupredemption&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is all the more interesting for those who already have safes with available capacity: they save themselves a step in the scenario presented above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, there is therefore an incentive to mint RAI (-&amp;gt;increase supply) and to sell it on the market (-&amp;gt;bearish pressure) which gradually reduces the price on the market, making it converge towards the redemption price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-market-price--redemption-price-1&#34;&gt;When market price &amp;lt; redemption price
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opposite case, the redemption rate becomes positive, making the existing debt more expensive. Users with active safes have an interest in paying off their debt, which reduces the available supply of RAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/marcheinfredemption-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;marcheinfredemption&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if they had converted their RAI to another asset (e.g. ETH for leveraged exposure), they will have to acquire RAI in the market (-&amp;gt;bullish pressure) in order to be able to repay their debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is in the best interest of the Reflexer system players to monitor the redemption rate and react accordingly. If you have an active safe, I invite you to consult it regularly - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stats.reflexer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;it can be seen on the Reflexer website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rate impacts simple RAI owners less directly, especially if they use them to produce a return (which can offset a negative rate) but it is still a metric to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-adjustment-of-the-redemption-rate&#34;&gt;Dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate is one of the essential features of Reflexer / RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. To better understand why this is critical, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the situation on Maker pre-MCD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The demand for DAI is (part of) the demand for stablecoins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, DAI are created by leveraging ETH, so they depend on the need/appetite for leverage on ETH, which is independent of the demand for stablecoins, which mostly depends on general market conditions (bear or bull and others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If demand is higher than supply, on Maker, there is no dynamic adjustment. You have to wait for a vote of the governance (and the delays that go with it) to lower the Stability Fee. And it&amp;rsquo;s the same in the other direction (too much supply).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;strong&gt;the balance between the supply and demand side of the equation is almost impossible to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;, which is why the pre-MCD DAI could often end up above its peg. Maker solved this problem by adding many types of collateral, including non-trustless stablecoins and then the PSM which automatically mints DAI from USDC when needed. The solution proposed by Reflexer (dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate) has the merit of &lt;strong&gt;solving the problem at the level of the system itself&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows to keep ETH as the only collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flx-and-rais-de-governance-strategy&#34;&gt;FLX and RAI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;de-governance&amp;rdquo; strategy.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the RAI, Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s system also has a second token, FLX, the &amp;ldquo;ungovernance&amp;rdquo; token. It is used for system governance and also serves as a last resort liquidity mechanism (in case of bad debt), with a system quite similar to Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FLX token can be purchased on the market, but it is mostly &lt;strong&gt;distributed to the main actors involved in the system&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.reflexer.finance/earn/incentives&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the exhaustive list of FLX incentives&lt;/a&gt; is available on the Reflexer website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are eligible for FLX (claimable on the Reflexer website, monthly distribution) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safes owners who bring their RAI in liquidity on the UNIv2 ETH/RAI pair (migration in progress, end soon) or UNIv3 RAI/DAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But also the liquidity providers on FLX/ETH (migration in progress, end soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally the FLX stakers in the equivalent of the Safety Module at Reflexer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also incentives in FLX related to the use of RAI in various DeFi services, detailed in the last part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.reflexer.finance/incentives/flx-staking&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FLX staking (Uni V2 FLX/ETH)&lt;/a&gt; serves as both an incentive mechanism to provide liquidity as well as a guarantee for the system. If the system is under-collateralized, the stakers will be diluted (-&amp;gt;token LP liquidated) so that the module acquires RAI and brings the system back to equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a normal situation, the stakers simply enjoy a rather attractive return. Just like Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module, this module has a time limit for unstake, to avoid liquidity drain in critical periods: it is 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the basics on FLX, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss its long-term issues a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gouvernance-exit-plan&#34;&gt;The gouvernance exit plan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reflexer system is intended to be &amp;ldquo;governance-minimized&amp;rdquo;. This has been the case since its inception, since decisions that are made by governance in Maker (Stability Fee of vaults) are automated in Reflexer (PID controller).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision is simply to automate everything that can be automated in the long term, once the system is mature, and to give the keys to the subsystems that cannot be automated to the FLX holder community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has set three main levels related to this objective &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;detailed in the FLX presentation article&lt;/a&gt;. Each level is linked to a date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 months after launch - April 17, 2022: minimization of governance on the main subsystems (liquidation, auction and taxation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18 months after launch - August 17, 2022: minimization of governance on all main contracts, except for the PID controller, oracles and the Savior mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd step (date incoming): handover (to FLX holdeurs) of the remaining mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this overview is enough to understand the interest of RAI and how it works. So let&amp;rsquo;s see how RAI is already used in various DeFi protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-defi-ecosystem-around-rai&#34;&gt;The DeFi ecosystem around RAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is gradually being adopted within the DeFi ecosystem, and that&amp;rsquo;s great to see! So I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a quick overview of the different RAI integrations in DeFi protocols, starting with money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-fuse-rari-capital&#34;&gt;RAI on Fuse (Rari Capital)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuse is a rather innovative money market since it allows the creation of pools by players who are not the team, and eventually anyone. It is therefore quite logical that Fuse was one of the first money markets to support RAI. Depending on the pool, it is also possible to &lt;strong&gt;use RAI as collateral on Fuse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAI is currently available in 3 asset pools with different risk levels and borrowable tokens:&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;fuse-rai&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-aave&#34;&gt;RAI on Aave
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding support for RAI already a few weeks ago, Aave recently allocated a (very moderate) amount of StkAAVE to incentivize borrowing and depositing on RAI. It was necessary to shed light on one of the main contradictions of the platform: Aave is a decentralized money market that (still) uses the vast majority of its budget to encourage borrowing/deposits on stablecoins that are not stablecoins at all (USDC and USDT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: for the moment &lt;strong&gt;the max LTV of RAI is 0: RAI cannot be used as collateral on Aave&lt;/strong&gt;. No discrimination here, this is pretty standard on Aave&amp;rsquo;s part - this is the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; and prudent procedure when adding a new type of collateral. Governance can vote to increase this value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-cream&#34;&gt;RAI on Cream
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cream was one of the first money markets to support RAI. However, it is an extremely risky and non-value-added, even deleterious, second-tier money market over the long term. So I&amp;rsquo;ll stop there, and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;invite you to read this article if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-idle-finance&#34;&gt;RAI on Idle Finance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idle Finance is a service that allows, as the name suggests, to set up passive return strategies. In the case of RAI, Idle leverages the returns available on Fuse as well as Aave. Initially, there was also Cream but the governance chose to refocus the strategies to contain the risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the native RAI return, a deposit on Idle Finance also allows you to benefit from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a FLX output, visible here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A StkAAVE yield (corresponding to the share of RAI deployed on Aave)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, also a yield in IDLE (soon - voted by the governance but not yet implemented)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to own RAI over the long term to hedge against dollar/euro risks, the Idle deposit is rather attractive to produce a totally passive return. Be careful though, this means compounding several smart contract risks: Reflexer + Aave + Fuse + Idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai--fei-protocol&#34;&gt;RAI + Fei Protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fei is another stablecoin that seeks to maximize decentralization. Here the approach is different and is essentially based on the notion of Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). In short, the bulk of liquidity in EIF pairs is controlled by the protocol itself. The funds come from the genesis of the protocol where users have committed ETH in order to acquire FEI as well as TRIBE (governance token) at their creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a stablecoin that shares a characteristic with RAI and LUSD: it is fully collateralized by trustless assets (ETH). Nevertheless, FEI is much closer to LUSD than to RAI in the sense that it remains pegged to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Fei DAO voted to &lt;strong&gt;diversify some of the protocol cash flow to RAI&lt;/strong&gt; to make it more sustainable. Thus, up to $6M (~2M RAI) will be acquired and deployed on Aave and Fuse to produce a return.  Other DAOs are also considering diversifying some of their cash to RAI (Moloch, DxDAO, Metagame, etc.), so I expect more similar initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things from this fairly comprehensive presentation of RAI. As always, keep in mind that I choose my topics carefully and this article is not intended as investment advice. In this case, Reflexer/RAI was chosen here because it is an elegant system whose analysis allows to discuss many essential notions to better understand DeFi as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that reading this article has been informative for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/aave-governance-program/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/aave-governance-platform/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Calling for your support to keep Aave&#39;s governance community-driven" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m TokenBrice, and this post is my formal platform to solicit delegation in the Aave governance. While calling for delegations and explaining my vision for Aave, I&amp;rsquo;d also like to set a new standard for DAO delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find in the post details about my long-term vision for Aave, who I am, why I&amp;rsquo;m asking for your AAVE vote delegations today, as well as all relevant disclosures to help you make sure this responsibility is not conflicting or overlapping with any other ongoing ones I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find my vote delegate disclosure, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ErichDylus/Open-Source-Law/blob/main/forms/legal/Vote%20Delegate%20Disclosure.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-me-why-now-why-aave&#34;&gt;Why me, why now, why Aave?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been actively involved in the growth of DeFi, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actively committed to get involved in DAO&amp;rsquo;s politics. However, the recent developments in the space led me to believe that now more than ever, the community needs to come together and offer credible governance alternatives to the existing structures, mostly enabled by venture capitalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my early involvement in DeFi, I have fought to maximize accessibility and make sure the fundamentals of DeFi (transparency, trustlessness, permissionlessness &amp;amp; open-source) are preserved as the ecosystem grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now ready to uphold this vision at the Aave DAO level with an active participation in the governance. After reading &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards/4852&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the first proposal for the extension of the liquidity mining program&lt;/a&gt; on Aave, I realized that we needed to be proactive and lead the efforts for a counter-proposal if we do not want more structured, organized and better funded interest groups to make the decisions for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical decisions for major protocols are increasingly decided by a limited number of participants sharing similar interests, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-janus.md#uniswap-1m-uni-here-1m-uni-there&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s DeFi Education Fund vote&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to at least try to prevent a similar scenario from unfolding on Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-vision-for-aave&#34;&gt;My vision for Aave
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets are at the heart of DeFi. I think Aave established itself as both the most innovative and secure service available in the vertical, and the observed track record aligns with this view. Relative to other money markets, Aave managed to so far avoid any failure resulting in loss of funds for users (others did not). If that was to happen, thanks to the Safety Module, affected users could be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the liquidity mining extension, the ongoing proposal that motivated me to get more involved in the governance, my main concerns are the sizable budget currently proposed (27% of the total ecosystem reserve for a year) &amp;amp; the fact that it is allocated &amp;ldquo;blindly&amp;rdquo; based on set budget per assets with no other adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now calling for delegation to thrive to uphold the following principles in Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrive to provide comprehensive breakdowns of the challenges pertaining to the main votes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight to ensure that the Ecosystem Reserve is used in the best long-term interest of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate key concepts and ideas voiced by the community to make sure they are answered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a documented and motivated position for each main issue, with a particular attention given their impact on the protocol&amp;rsquo;s safety and resiliency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use, as much as possible, my existing network and presence to document Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance and make it more accessible, particularly to FR-speaking audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-delegate&#34;&gt;How to delegate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Sybil.org to check your voting power on various DAOs and handle delegations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Sybil.org - Aave&lt;/a&gt;: once you connect your wallet you&amp;rsquo;ll see your voting power on the right panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can self-delegate to use that voting power yourself (default) or delegate it to another wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wish to delegate your voting power to me, simply delegate to &lt;code&gt;tokenbrice.eth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following DeFi since before it bore its name and experimented with all the landmark protocols. With Mounir (ParaSwap) &amp;amp; Arthur, we created the DeFi France movement and helped it grow. I keep up with DeFi on a daily basis and share my research on a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://tokenbrice.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FR/EN blog&lt;/a&gt;, and host &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/tokenbrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 weekly live sessions&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the latest developments in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of French-speaking Aave team members, we produced what is widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive resources covering the protocol in French: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSL0JbBxvRM&amp;amp;list=PLreQl_vxgtPh-13wNlEWui7RTioCOFweN&amp;amp;index=2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 the Aave marathon (3h)&lt;/a&gt; with Marc Zeller, Alex &amp;amp; Statelayer. After the publication of a comprehensive &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇺🇸 guide helping users to assess risks on money markets&lt;/a&gt;, Alex also joined me for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L9DiHOouaY&amp;amp;list=PLreQl_vxgtPhSZeMiTbzXAjL_U-_NnQwD&amp;amp;index=23&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 another live session dedicated to risk assessment for money markets &amp;amp; her job as actuary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the media I control (this blog), I enforced some basic principles which I think give insight as to where I stand and what matters for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy-preservation&lt;/strong&gt;: the data collection is minimal and done using a self-hosted open-source service (Matomo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: the website is static &amp;amp; optimized to the best of my ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: the content lives in a github repo, all edits are publicly logged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including transparent funding&lt;/strong&gt;: the only source of funding accepted for this activity is the related &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/811/tokenbrice-evangelizing-defi-in-fr-en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;gitcoin grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Aave as a protocol here for the decades to come and will fight to make sure the DAO keeps a long-term focus. While the ecosystem reserve are significant, the current burn rate will empty them in a few years, for ~ $50M worth of stablecoins accrued in the protocol reserves (extrapolating the current rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my engagement in Aave governance started with the discussion on the liquidity mining program, I believe several other adjustments are also needed to maximize its long-term resiliency such as updates to the safety module budget and mechanisms, as well as a diversification of the protocol&amp;rsquo;s treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66 associated to the tokenbrice.eth ENS,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to participate in the governance of Aave, whether by proposing, voting, abstaining, or engaging in related discourse or otherwise, in accordance with its applicable parameters and guidelines. I understand that other externally owned accounts and addresses may delegate their voting power to me from time to time and intend that this disclosure will generally govern my actions as a delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have instituted policies and procedures with respect to delegations in the interest of transparency, which may be subject to update from time to time and are available here. Though I do not have a formal policy, in participating in the governance of Aave, I intend to act on the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will seek to remain informed about governance proposals and vote on matters from time to time using my independent judgment unless otherwise disclosed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will act in good faith and use reasonable care in participating in governance, including in making proposals and in voting;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will endeavor to provide transparent, good faith, and honest information as to my motivations and reasoning in carrying out my role as a delegate, or when soliciting the delegation of voting power;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not a party to any voting bloc, trust, or other group and will not engage in vote-buying, vote-selling, bribery, manipulation, or other undisclosed vote solicitation or coordination; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the extent I am aware of a material non-public conflict of interest that exists for a Delegator with respect to a proposal, I will refrain from voting in my capacity as a delegate for such Delegator with respect to such proposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conflict-disclosure&#34;&gt;Conflict Disclosure
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I currently have economic interest in ParaSwap (part-time contributor), and may engage in the DeFi France community from time to time. I may have direct or indirect economic interests in the various projects, entities, networks, and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time, including but not limited to ETH, CRV, CVX, LINK, LQTY, BAL, PNK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as disclosed herein, in participating in the governance of Aave, I am not acting on behalf of ParaSwap nor on behalf of any client, nor any voting power delegator, whether or not such delegation was solicited. If my views expressed in governance contexts are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me as a vote delegate or otherwise, nor will there be any coverage or indemnity from any applicable insurance or similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disclaimer-of-duty-to-update&#34;&gt;Disclaimer of Duty to Update
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date, nor of adjusting these disclosures for each applicable governance process, but will endeavor to act in good faith when soliciting the delegation of voting power and when acting in my capacity as a delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may contact me at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;mailto:me@tokenbrice.com&#34; &gt;me@tokenbrice.com&lt;/a&gt;, though I assume no duty for, and cannot guarantee my responsiveness to, or any action upon, any individual question, feedback, or request from a vote delegator or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Janus: the new sworn enemy of DeFi protocols?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-janus/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-janus/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/defi-janus-cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post Janus: the new sworn enemy of DeFi protocols?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mythology is often used to illustrate DeFi. For example, the Canaanite god Moloch is often mentioned to symbolize coordination issues. Today, I will identify with you a new deity from the DeFi pantheon: Janus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we analyze the mechanisms of open governance of DeFi protocols that can lead to the emergence of a new kind of challenge for DeFi, a sworn enemy that I propose to you to embody in the Roman deity Janus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the two-faced god, &lt;strong&gt;a Janus protocol suffers from a deep ambivalence&lt;/strong&gt;: although it can be an unquestionable success in terms of use, it faces serious antagonisms between its various stakeholders who involve the sustainability of the protocol (users, holders, investors, team and extended community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the Janus, you have to understand the inherent complexity of DeFi and how it can accommodate &lt;strong&gt;consensus on decisions that are deleterious or not optimal&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the context is set, we can analyze three Janus, each in their own way: MakerDAO, Yearn Finance and Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;complexity-and-governance-issues-fertile-ground-for-janus&#34;&gt;Complexity and governance issues: fertile ground for Janus
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of Janus protocols in the current situation is due to many factors that are difficult to prioritize. I have grouped them into three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;governance-and-voting-mechanisms&#34;&gt;Governance and voting mechanisms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governance of DeFi protocols takes place &lt;strong&gt;in an open and transparent&lt;/strong&gt; way, in several stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During discussions on different media such as Discord, the community converges on different ideas that can lead to proposals. Proposals are formalized, usually on governance forums and amended before reaching &lt;strong&gt;informal consensus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signaling&lt;/strong&gt; mechanisms (Snapshot) make it possible to identify the most relevant proposals. They are then &lt;strong&gt;submitted to the vote of the token holders&lt;/strong&gt; via the main governance mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most governance systems still operate on the logic of &lt;strong&gt;1 token = 1 vote&lt;/strong&gt;, thus assigning the same weight to all token holders regardless of their attitude towards the project or level of commitment by compared to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/influence-governance.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;influence-governance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measure the influence in the governance of DeFi protocols -&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Lsquaredleland/status/1411031620748943360&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some protocols have succeeded in challenging this approach by adding a logic of time commitment: interacting with Curve&amp;rsquo;s DAO requires engaging its CRVs for a period ranging from 1 to 4 years. A long-term commitment increases the effective voting power obtained (vCRV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;strong&gt;participation is generally low&lt;/strong&gt;, even when delegation mechanisms are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;complexity-of-decisions&#34;&gt;Complexity of decisions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate governance proposals for a decentralized finance protocol, one must have &lt;strong&gt;an understanding of a whole set of basics relating to Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;, blockchain and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, ideally, you need a thorough understanding of the protocol in question, as well as its &lt;strong&gt;interactions with other protocols, synergies&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. We can also now add to this all the additional complexity linked to the multiplication of scalability solutions: sidechains and L2.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the formulation of proposals on governance forums is generally quite technical, which &lt;strong&gt;makes their understanding&lt;/strong&gt; difficult and opens the door to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, governance suffers from a real mass effect: as protocols develop, the amount of information to digest to have an informed vote increases accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the MakerDAO governance forum estimated his weekly monitoring and participation work to be around 40 hours per week, steadily increasing:

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;governance-supports&#34;&gt;Governance supports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although governance is open and transparent, &lt;strong&gt;it still often relies on various proprietary services and therefore administered&lt;/strong&gt;, most often by the team itself. This causes serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So governance-related discussions are usually done on Discord and the Governance Forum - both &lt;strong&gt;mediums are usually moderated directly by the project team&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team may have &lt;strong&gt;control over reporting mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://snapshot.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt;. The accumulation of all these limitations of decentralized governance systems can lead to situations observed recently, where token owners do not vote in their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick tour of the current limits of governance systems was necessary to have the context for what follows. So let&amp;rsquo;s see the three Janus that I spotted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uniswap-1m-uni-here-1m-uni-there&#34;&gt;Uniswap: 1M UNI here, 1M UNI there
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;proposal-05-in-summary&#34;&gt;Proposal 05 in summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rushed vote which resulted in the signing of an almost blank check from 1M UNI for a group of legal directors of large decentralized projects responsible for deploying a DeFI lobbying strategy. Very few transparency mechanisms have been deployed and the influence of the UNI holder community on the funded group is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-005-defi-education-fund/12963&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Proposition 05 Uniswap Gouvernance - DeFi Education Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compression-of-governance&#34;&gt;Compression of governance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Uniswap, it was all there. It all started with a rushed vote as members of the community had &lt;strong&gt;many, many questions ignored&lt;/strong&gt;. The community is concerned about the lack of control over the funds allocated without any conditions. Chris Blec has gathered the main questions and concerns in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1409857319144394758&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; and managed to get some responses from the team in a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://odysee.com/@ChrisBlec:8/chrisblec-june24-twitterspace:9?r=DeLsAYctGhcLFvkGBKYgE2tN17fUXA9u&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Twitter space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;strong&gt;the organization that will receive the 1M UNI is made up of close members of the Uniswap team&lt;/strong&gt; and project investors such as a16z are also suspected of having been decisive in the adoption of the decision. The proposal also had direct support from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 17 edit: quickly after receiving the funds, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/sale-of-usdc-raises-concerns-regarding-newly-formed-defi-education-fund/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the multisig sold half of the total balance (500 000 UNI)&lt;/a&gt; for USDC, currently sitting idle in the wallet - not even farming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the proposal wants to be broader than Uniswap since they are officially mandated to lobby DeFi, but we can ask the question of the vision of DeFi carried by such profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transparency-maybe-control-hell-no-&#34;&gt;Transparency? Maybe. Control? Hell no !
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the reactions to the first iterations of the proposal, different mechanisms have been added to bring more transparency to the actions of the DeFi Education Fund. The team is also committed to implementing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/withtally/safeguard&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FailSafe&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible. This would allow the DAO (UNI holders) to be able to exercise a veto on the transactions carried out by the multisig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However at the present time &lt;strong&gt;the effective control of the DAO remains limited&lt;/strong&gt;: the vote has passed and the 1M UNI are now allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode corresponds for me to the equivalent of an embezzlement of public funds, except that here the funds come from a DAO. The adventure and its adventures also shed light on the effective power exercised by the various stakeholders in the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;makerdao-imbalance-of-competing-interests&#34;&gt;MakerDAO: imbalance of competing interests
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Maker is more general and goes back much further. It is a common problem in DeFi of aligning the divergent interests of different participants. In addition, to respond quickly to the growing demand for DAI, &lt;strong&gt;the multiplication of collateral (MCD update) has greatly impacted the trustlessness and effective decentralization of DAI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 60% of DAI collateral is tokens that require some form of trust like USDC, wBTC or TUSD. The problem has been around for a long time and is not going to be resolved, if ever. I have already discussed this problem on this blog, I refer you to this article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abusive-user-fees&#34;&gt;Abusive user fees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we will rather dig into the problem of excessive fees which illustrates &lt;strong&gt;a classic case of rent maximization on customers thought to be captive&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DAI being a synthetic stablecoin struck directly by the user, its annual borrowing fees should not exceed 2-3% and this is still costly. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt;, an alternative to Maker, charges 0.5% annually fees on borrowed LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the last update, the main maker ETH vault (ETH-A) was charging 5.5% annual fees. It&amp;rsquo;s now down to 3.5%, but the fees on the vault closest to Liquity&amp;rsquo;s borrowing conditions (ETH-B, minimum collateralization = 130% // 110% on Liquity) remains at 9% annually, or &lt;strong&gt;18 times more expensive than its alternative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-annuity-for-mkr-holders&#34;&gt;An annuity for MKR holders?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakerDAO fees are usually high, even though they&amp;rsquo;ve been at zero or close for short periods of time to stimulate demand. So &lt;strong&gt;why does the DAO Maker systematically vote excessive fees&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is as simple as 1 + 1 = 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees taken from Maker vaults are used to buy MKR tokens in the markets and burn them, making the MKR token rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are voted by Maker&amp;rsquo;s DAO, in proportion to the MKR tokens owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very design of the protocol thus encourages MKR owners to vote for &lt;strong&gt;extracting the maximum fees tolerated by users&lt;/strong&gt;, and not a penny less. Indeed, each base point &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in additional costs translates into more MKR burned and therefore a priori a capital which is appreciated for the owners of the token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound fabulous in terms of tokenomics because it optimizes for the best possible price on MKR (theoretically), but &lt;strong&gt;it is done to the detriment of the users of the service&lt;/strong&gt; that the platform offers - and therefore goes against the long-term interest- term of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also keep in mind that unlike most protocols, Maker has never implemented a mechanism to turn its users into holders (liquidity mining). So I hardly see how Maker can be competitive with such a structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ambiguous-case-of-yearn-finance&#34;&gt;The ambiguous case of Yearn Finance
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is arguably the simplest and most straightforward example of a Janus. In barely a year, Yearn has become a &lt;strong&gt;major DeFi protocol with $ 4B in assets deposited&lt;/strong&gt; and above all &lt;strong&gt;delusional profitability&lt;/strong&gt; that the team likes to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the story is not so rosy depending on your perspective. We are therefore going to study Yearn&amp;rsquo;s situation from 3 angles: from a user&amp;rsquo;s point of view, for another protocol and for the Yearn DAO itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crazy-fees-for-users&#34;&gt;Crazy fees for users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s success comes at what cost? Again, essentially &lt;strong&gt;users who are literally being robbed by Yearn&lt;/strong&gt; - fees are among the highest seen for a DeFi asset manager, yet complex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearn takes &lt;strong&gt;2% annual management fee on the entire deposit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearn also takes a 20% performance fee: 20% of all farmed assets go into cash. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first charge is the most problematic since it means that Yearn&amp;rsquo;s excessively greedy charges lead to vaults that… lose money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, any vault that does not achieve a minimum of 2% annual return on Yearn ends up in the red once the management fees are taken, without even taking into account the performance fees &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocol-side-yearns-hug-of-death&#34;&gt;Protocol side: Yearn&amp;rsquo;s hug of Death
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn allows its users to farm different protocols like Curve by automatically managing the composition of their yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is practical for the user, but it also means that ** Yearn systematically sells all the tokens farmed ** by his vaults: we can therefore ask the question of the impact and relevance for the farmed protocol, which is therefore under selling pressure on its native token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Convex has shown that a better structured protocol in terms of tokenomics and specific to Curve can offer a synergistic alternative where the returns are much higher, while avoiding the systematic sale of farmed tokens. I analyze the Convex &amp;ldquo;flywheel&amp;rdquo; in this article:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-flywheel.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereby, it confronted Yearn with its contradictions and Yearn essentially capitulated by integrating Convex to optimize the performance of its vaults. This now means that &lt;strong&gt;Yearn users pay a fee to Convex and help the protocol accumulate more VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; and thus widen its gap with Yearn - checkmate for Yearn on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;concerning-yearn-dao&#34;&gt;Concerning Yearn DAO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this rather worrying fundamental situation since Yearn now offers &lt;strong&gt;essentially non-competitive products&lt;/strong&gt; (all Curve vaults), Yearn presents itself as one of the undeniable successes of DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the team seems to measure the success of the protocol by the volume of fees collected by it. The indicator is obviously dangerous since with the management fees at 2% per year, any deposit in Yearn systematically pays fees even if little or no profit is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than taking the fees charged as an indicator and therefore a measure of success, the protocol could be optimized on the basis of the profits generated for depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and even if it is a more subjective topic, the communication around the project is muddled or even almost disturbing at times, for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/yearn-revenues-projected-to-surpass-tradfis-fueled-by-thriving-community/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;when Yearn is compared&lt;/a&gt; to traditional asset managers like WealthFront or BlackRock - I find that quite unbalanced since Yearn charges similar fees to these structures but operates in a much more dynamic market. In addition, are such companies really relevant models to have in DeFi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/yearn-comp.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;yearn-comp&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yearn compares to asset managers, it may be because the comparison with its DeFi peers is clear:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/defi-asset-manager.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-asset-manager&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, where Convex works to allow cvxCRV holders to vote in decisions of the DAO Curve, Yearn is taking control over the voting power associated with CRVs deposited by its users on the yveCRV. The same approach can be observed with the airdrops allocated to VeCRV holders: Yearn grants them to buy CRVs and sponsor their yveCRV vault, while Convex makes them accessible to its depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-the-janus-defensible&#34;&gt;Are the Janus defensible?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have set the scene with three Janus, the question of their defendability remains. All three have credible alternatives, often more recent and with more balanced tokenomics. So let&amp;rsquo;s see how our Janus evolve in relation to these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just two months of existence, Convex has already surpassed Yearn in terms of the total value of assets deposited. So far, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s feedback has failed to turn the tide, and I think &lt;strong&gt;only a major overhaul of the model will allow the protocol to remain competitive in the long run&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless &lt;strong&gt;the machine is launched&lt;/strong&gt;: Convex already has more than twice as many CRVs as Yearn and accumulates more quickly. And even though Yearn has lots of other protocols, it seems unlikely to me that he will ever be able to compete again on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Marker side, more and more people are starting to point out the absurdity of the current situation on DAI, and the alternatives are gaining ground. In a few weeks and with only ETH as accepted collateral, Liquity has already attracted the equivalent of more than 40% of the total value deposited in MakerDAO:

		alt=&#34;tokenterminal-tvl-maker-liquity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Liquity, borrowing costs are much lower, clearer, and distributed directly to LQTY stakers. The service is thus more open and participatory than MakerDAO while being brutally more efficient. Here again, I think a major overhaul of MakerDAO would be necessary for the protocol to regain its relevance and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for Uniswap, the competition is even fiercer. The protocol is evolving in the face of mature tokenomics like Curve, which has a protocol revenue sharing mechanism active for almost a year, while nothing is yet offered on UNI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all three fronts, I think the situation will force Uniswap, Maker and Yearn to renew themselves. However, with the pace of the industry, the noose is tightening and their more open, efficient and synergistic alternatives are rapidly gaining ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the DAOs of the three protocols fell out of sync with their users, the latter reminded them where their interests lay in the simplest and most effective way we know of: with consistent capital movement. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what happens next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI is still seen by many as a decentralized stablecoin that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require trust, although it no longer does. There are still few stablecoins that rely only on trustless (ETH) and credibly decentralized (or on track) collateral: I know of two - Liquity&amp;rsquo;s LUSD and Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-flywheel/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-flywheel/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/defi-flywheel-cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three weeks, the Convex protocol attracted over $3 billion in deposits, while becoming the largest 🐳 whale of CRV, today and probably forever. Luck is never a negligible factor, but with such a smashing entry into DeFi top protocols, we must look much further. Indeed, the key to understanding the meteoric rise of Convex is tokenomics, and this is our topic of the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, besides the technical, you also have to be a fine sociologist, or rather a &amp;ldquo;game theorist&amp;rdquo; as we say around here: to know how to anticipate the reactions of crowds to a given set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of liquidity mining programs last year showed that the right set of rules can move huge amounts of capital. The question now is how to do it wisely, i.e. with an awareness of what is at stake &lt;strong&gt;in the long run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, liquidity mining by itself only attracts &lt;strong&gt;mercenary and opportunistic deposits&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, liquidity mining is more a tool to make a project known than to perpetuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To last in DeFi, it is a matter of tokenomics: i.e. the mechanics of the native tokens of protocols. &lt;strong&gt;Tokenomics is in a way the gameplay of a DeFi protocol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I am a big fan of the CRV model. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect, since the game around the CRV token has never been as lively as it has been in the last few weeks. Some people even talk about #lockening to describe &lt;strong&gt;the race to accumulate CRVs&lt;/strong&gt; that Convex, Yearn and StakeDAO are engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go into details to understand the concept of flywheel with the example of Convex / Curve. I will finish by analyzing protocols that could be used in a similar scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rise-of-the-first--defi-flywheel&#34;&gt;The rise of the first 🎡 DeFi flywheel
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of Convex, a new term began to be used to describe its operation and tokenomics: 🎡 flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a precise definition yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try one: it describes a protocol that achieves a winning trifecta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tokenomics that offers interesting opportunities to token owners optimistic about the future of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A protocol that is itself relevant and meets a real need, ideally in direct synergy with another protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A liquidity mining program (+airdrop) to start the loop and attract the first token owners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generalized the Convex model, but it has an additional feature: Convex is a kind of &amp;ldquo;meta-protocol&amp;rdquo;: it is &lt;strong&gt;built entirely on top of Curve Finance and in synergy with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the forerunner of the flywheel would probably be found among protocols built in synergy with others. For example, although it is built on top of BSC and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rekt.news/pancakebunny-rekt/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;suffered a significant attack recently&lt;/a&gt;, the Bunny protocol helped the DEX PancakeSwap to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny offers to manage Pancake liquidity provider positions, while issuing its own token based on the returns generated. This simplifies the management of liquidity providers positions on Pancake while generating an additional source of return (BUNNY token).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to fully understand the concept of 🎡 flywheel, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the best one we&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to see so far: Convex. It turns out to be a bit more complicated because it relies on Curve, so you first need to understand the curve tokenomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crv-a-tokenomics-for--flywheels&#34;&gt;CRV: a tokenomics for 🎡 flywheels?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve Finance&amp;rsquo;s tokenomics is almost a year old and yet it is still often misunderstood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great elegance of the CRV tokenomics resides in &lt;strong&gt;aligning the interests of several actors better than any other tokenomics known to date&lt;/strong&gt;: the liquidity providers, the CRV holders and the Curve protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the model tends over time to merge the two populations (CRV holders and LP) through two mechanics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity providers are incensitivised in CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV stakers (VeCRV holders) can &amp;ldquo;boost&amp;rdquo; the CRV yield of their liquidity provision on Curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model creates an interesting path for protocol users, who are &lt;strong&gt;strongly encouraged to make a long-term commitment&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, locking CRVs into VeCRVs becomes more and more efficient the longer the commitment is - the maximum being 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, I invite you to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakecapital.substack.com/p/curve-tokenomics-and-first-mover&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/crv-tokenomics.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;crv-tokenomics&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the CRV model also has its limitations, the most obvious one being the impact of Ethereum transaction fees: large sums of money can be required for the game to start making sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, for a long time now, the biggest contributors of liquidity on Curve have not been users but &lt;strong&gt;other protocols&lt;/strong&gt;. Pooling funds reduces the impact of gas fees while potentially developing a VeCRV accumulation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, various solutions have emerged to &lt;strong&gt;manage liquidity positions on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;, the best known being Yearn, but there are also Harvest and StakeDAO. While they can be useful for depositors, they suffer from two major limitations: high management fees and a parasitic approach. Yearn, Harvest or StakeDAO immediately sell any farmed tokens. This results in increasing selling pressure on the native token of the protocols used to produce the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-convex-model--the-first-flywheel-&#34;&gt;The Convex model : the first flywheel 🎡
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Convex way to operate offers a &amp;ldquo;Yearn-like&amp;rdquo; service  to liquidity providers on Curve: automated management of their position to maximize returns. Like Yearn, Convex has a VeCRV accumulation strategy to maximize the return of depositors in CRV through the boost mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the underlying approach is totally different from Yearn and is part of a virtuous synergy with Curve :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No systematic selling&lt;/strong&gt;: unlike Yearn, Convex does not sell the tokens it farms. Liquidity providers are thus remunerated in CRV but also in CVX, the native token of Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fees collected by Convex are 100% dedicated to the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, while Yearn for example pays strategists - obviously quite redundant on a simple strategy like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the distribution of the collected fees, Convex creates two &lt;strong&gt;interesting staking opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; to compose its returns, detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;the liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; on the token that represents a CRV in Convex (CvxCRV) is more optimal than the Yearn equivalent: CvxCRV trades in a pool directly against the CRV, with an incentive program in CVX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fees--the-lifeblood-of-success&#34;&gt;Fees : the lifeblood of success
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the fee structure is key to get what has happened with Convex. The protocol now controls over 32M VeCRVs, which is &lt;strong&gt;almost twice Yearn&amp;rsquo;s total, and that&amp;rsquo;s just after three weeks of existence&lt;/strong&gt;.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/convex-curve-stats.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;convex-curve-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex charges a total fee of 16% on all CRVs farmed on the protocol (compared to 20/2 on all tokens for Yearn, or 30% for Harvest for example). Of the 16%, 1% is used to cover operational costs such as the gas cost of collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/convex-synergies-CRV-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;convex-synergies-CRV&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is the redistribution of the remaining 15%, i.e. 15% of all CRVs farmed by Convex (&lt;strong&gt;over 400,000 CRVs per day&lt;/strong&gt; You can view the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/pools?see=0x989aeb4d175e16225e39e87d0d97a3360524ad80&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Convex Curve position via CurveMarketCap here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two staker populations are eligible for this juicy pie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% is paid back to CvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt; stakers, in CRV, in addition to their return in 3pool and CVX tokens (+airdrops VeCRV holder). Owning CvxCRV becomes much more attractive than VeCRV for a simple depositor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5% is returned to the CVX stakers&lt;/strong&gt;, in the form of CvxCRV. This means that 5% of all CRVs farmed by Convex are captured and locked within the protocol. This mechanically increases the pool of VeCRVs even if no third party CRV deposits are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The situation is still ongoing and there are still surprising gaps: for example, at the time of writing (June 07) the total capitalization of the CVX token is not even half of the value of the CRVs that the protocol has ($30M vs $80M). I think the situation will harmonize in the long run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-anticipate-the-next-flywheels&#34;&gt;How to anticipate the next flywheels?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some notions about Curve and an analysis of the flywheel 🎡 Convex, we now have the cards in hand to venture into the game of foresight. Before that however I propose instead to go look into the past to analyze an almost failed flywheel : Pickle Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pickle-finance--the-wrong-timing&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance : the wrong timing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, Pickle has all the makings of a flywheel: it is a system to increase the returns on Yearn deposits through the additional issue of PICKLE tokens. PICKLE has elements of the VeCRV system, with a locking mechanism (DILL) that allows to boost PICKLE returns on deposits on Pickle Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that&amp;hellip; Pickle does not technically add anything to Yearn, apart from issuing PICKLE. Moreover, Pickle does not specialize: farms are offered on Yearn vaults but also some Sushi pairs. Unlike Convex, Pickle is therefore not able to develop a unique advantage (moat) on farmed services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, nothing is definitive. Pickle&amp;rsquo;s situation could evolve, if the tokenomics of the underlying protocols (YFI and SUSHI) evolve. Both protocols seem to be moving towards a reappropriation of the VeCRV model, so it is quite possible. A model that combines the Adamant/Ellipsis burn logic and the Curve boosting has even been proposed for Sushi: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;oSUSHI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;veYFI&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adamant-finance---a-flywheel-on-polygons-lp-&#34;&gt;Adamant Finance : 🎡 a flywheel on Polygon&amp;rsquo;s LP ?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adamant is a still new protocol that exists on the Polygon sidechain. It allows the easy management of liquidity positions on the main exchange services: QuickSwap, Cometh, SushiSwap, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to automatic compounding of returns, Adamant also offers additional ADDY rewards (based on profits generated). All ADDY earned are vested (locked) for 3 months and can be withdrawn earlier with a 50% penalty. This is redistributed to those who agree to staker + lock their ADDY for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all ADDY stakers (even vested ones) benefit from a share of the fees collected by the platform, distributed in wMATIC. The protocol thus has a tokenomics already quite elaborate with different retention mechanisms, but it still has some improvements to find to become a flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one would be to introduce a greater incentive to lock in ADDYs through a boost system similar to Curve. Depositors with ADDYs in stake+lock will have a better return in ADDYs on their LP position. This is already under discussion or even in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adamant still has to develop a synergy with the farmed protocols as strong as Convex with Curve. This is difficult or impossible for the moment because none of them have tokenomics as subtle as CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-x-liquity-service---money-market-flywheel&#34;&gt;An &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; Liquity service : 🎡 money market flywheel
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have discussed flywheels built on decentralized exchange services, which seems the most obvious. Nevertheless, we can consider similar models on other types of services, like money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I propose to finish with a theoretical flywheel of my own. To my knowledge, such a protocol does not exist yet: it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic equation is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong demand for &amp;ldquo;ETH passive&amp;rdquo; products - products that develop strategies on ETH in order to accumulate ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to borrow stablecoins using ETH as collateral. This way, stablecoins can earn an additional return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this strategy, Liquity would be &lt;strong&gt;the platform of choice without question&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the cost of borrowing is the lowest in the market (almost 12x cheaper than Maker over a year) and there is no shortage of opportunities for yield on the LUSD stablecoin.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/protocole-x-liquity-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;protocole-x-liquity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of such a pooled strategy is to &lt;strong&gt;manage the collateralization ratio&lt;/strong&gt; and to be able to balance it quickly if the market moves. Here again, Liquity lends itself well to this since the stability pool offers an attractive return on the LUSD while allowing &lt;strong&gt;the rapid mobilization of LUSD to repay the debt if necessary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The X protocol in question would offer &lt;strong&gt;a passive ETH investment product&lt;/strong&gt; for users who would not have to manage the position themselves. We can also consider that the X protocol has its own token with a tokenomics that addresses one of the main dangers of the strategy: the lack of predictability. Thus the native token of protocol X could be used to encourage long deposits of a predictable duration (users lock their ETH over 3/6/9/12 months for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term commitments also allow to &lt;strong&gt;develop a strategy on the LQTY farmed by the LUSDs.&lt;/strong&gt; By committing ETH for one year in the protocol for example, the user will be able to claim a portion of the LQTYs farmed by the whole protocol, and benefited, for life, from the LUSDs and ETHs they generate. The synergy of the protocol with Liquity as well as the long term returns are maximized if protocol X does not sell any LQTY, as is the case in the concept proposed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will help you better understand what has been going on with Convex, Yearn and Curve over the past few weeks and use the lessons learned from this episode to identify similar opportunities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about different incentive mechanisms is that they precede action. In game theory, there are no certainties, but some behaviors are almost mechanical - for those who really understand incentives and their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself !&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/money-market-recipes/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/money-market-recipes-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 🌽 Defi money markets cookbook" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this blog, I frequently discuss about money markets and assets market in DeFi. Basically, they allow you to &lt;strong&gt;loan and borrow tokens&lt;/strong&gt;. These two actions have become like &lt;strong&gt;deFi verbs&lt;/strong&gt;: they are used directly or indirectly in almost every strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it is crucial to understand the protocols you are using and especially &lt;strong&gt;the different &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;money market risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Today, I would like to focus on the why and the how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which strategies can be implemented using money markets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can they be deployed in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than mechanically reproducing the strategies presented as examples, I invite you to try to understand the approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leveraged-bets-on-a-money-market-via-the-market-itself&#34;&gt;Leveraged bets on a money market via the market itself
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every money markets have an associated token, for example the AAVE token for Aave. It is generally used for the governance of the protocol and sometimes also allows to capture part of the value it generates. With this strategy, we will &lt;strong&gt;use a money market to borrow assets that will then be used to gain exposure to the native token of the desired platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimism about the future of a given money market. It&amp;rsquo;s native token in this scenario is expected to appreciate in line with the growth of the market over the medium/long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 - 24 months. ~3 months is a recommended minimum so that gas fees and borrowing costs don&amp;rsquo;t impact the returns of the strategy too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result&lt;/strong&gt;: the acquired token appreciates, which allows to pay back the debt (+ possible interest) at term by reselling part of the initial position. Once the debt is repaid, part of the acquired tokens can be kept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:&lt;/strong&gt; If the token in question can produce a return (e.g. AAVE in the Safety Module), this will allow the debt to be repaid even faster or to accumulate &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; tokens if the scenario of its price appreciation is verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this strategy is quite basic, it is one of my favorites. I recently shared with you on Twitter an example of how to put it into practice, which we will detail here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the concerned protocol is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://liquity.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; and the implementation of the strategy is quite simple, but has two variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;direct-exposure-to-the-native-token&#34;&gt;Direct exposure to the native token
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either by directly exposing yourself to the LQTY token, which is of course more risky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/mm-long-token-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mm-long-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; via one of the frontends, they will serve as collateral for the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow LUSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap LUSD (via ParaSwap for the best rate!) for LQTY, the native token of Liquity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake LQTY, which generates LUSD and some ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually repayment of debt (2) via LUSD yield (4) and resale of some of the LQTY acquired in step 3 after price appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or more conservatively, with a strategy using Liquity to borrow LUSDs and make them productive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exposure-mainly-in-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Exposure mainly in stablecoins
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/mm-long-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mm-long-token-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; via one of the frontends, they will serve as collateral for the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow LUSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake LUSD via either the Stability Pool (-&amp;gt; LQTY + ETH) or the LUSD pool on Curve Finance (-&amp;gt; Native + LQTY + CRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually repayment of debt (2) via yield (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn Finance also offers a LUSD vault that automatically manages the position on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investing-time-rather-than-money&#34;&gt;Investing time rather than money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alchemix arrival has opened up new perspectives in terms of strategy. On Alchemix, the debt repays itself over time. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the collateral used (yDAI) is a stablecoin that produces a return (via Yearn)&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus with the current conditions the loan is self-repaying in three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest a simple strategy to take advantage of Alchemix to make a profit. The main drawback is that &lt;strong&gt;only half of the amount of DAI initially placed in Alchemix can be borrowed in AlUSD&lt;/strong&gt; and then invested.
Nevertheless, as this strategy is based on stablecoins, it does not - (⚠ oracles) - involve any price risk and therefore does not require daily monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; DAI that will be locked in for ~3 years. Only half of the deposited amount is mobilizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; ~3 years (depends on DAI return rate on Yearn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result&lt;/strong&gt;: In 3 years, the AlUSD debt is fully repaid and the DAI initially mobilized on Alchemix are free again. It remains to be seen what happened with the investment made with the borrowed AlUSD: it all depends on the choices made, I do not predict the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the borrowed AlUSD to invest in a token that can produce a return. This allows you to make a compound investment or even pay off Alchemix debt faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-alcx-via-alchemix&#34;&gt;Long ALCX via Alchemix
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the concept, I propose another simple strategy which is equivalent to long Alchemix via its token ALCX :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/alchemix-investment-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alchemix-investment-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit DAI as collateral on Alchemix. Alchemix deploys it on Yearn Finance to generate a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow up to 50% of the initial value deposited in AlUSD, a stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest the AlUSD in the desired token. Here for the example it is ALCX the native governance token of Alchemix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake the acquired token to produce a return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The repayment of the debt in AlUSD contracted on Alchemix is done automatically with time. It is possible to repay in advance thanks to the generated returns (4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-a-hodl-collateral-to-work-over-the-long-term&#34;&gt;Putting a &amp;ldquo;hodl&amp;rdquo; collateral to work over the long term
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to DeFi several years ago with a simple ambition: I wanted to put my Ethers to work. At the time it was not an easy task but nowadays there are many very interesting solutions. I will focus on one of them, Aave, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave has launched &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity mining&lt;/strong&gt; program paid in StkAave&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Aave V2 - Mainnet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave is accessible on the &lt;strong&gt;sidechain Polygon&lt;/strong&gt; where the low fees allow to deploy DeFi strategies efficiently even with small capital. There is also a liquidity mining program there, in MATIC &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this strategy as accessible as possible, we will develop the example on the Polygon sidechain. It is therefore possible to use any of the tokens supported as collateral on the Aave/Polygon market: MATIC, AAVE, wETH, wBTC, USDC, and DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to&#34;&gt;How-to
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy is to &lt;strong&gt;produce returns through the borrowing of stablecoins used to provide liquidity on the Curve exchange service&lt;/strong&gt;. With the liquidity mining program on Aave, every step of the process is potentially lucrative at least in MATIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Having tokens accepted as collateral on Aave, and bring them back to Polygon for example using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the POS bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; Short / medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; Returns in MATIC, stablecoins and ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:/&lt;/strong&gt;. Prospective: mining CRV &amp;amp; potential leverage when LP Curve Polygon tokens are accepted as collateral on Aave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;putting-eth-to-work-on-polygon&#34;&gt;Putting ETH to work on Polygon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this strategy, I start with the assumption of generating a return from ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/polygon-aave-curve-eth-farming-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;polygon-aave-curve-eth-farming-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH deposit as collateral on Aave/Polygon (+native +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowing stablecoins (-APR +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit and staking of stablecoins on Curve/Polygon (+natif +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Curve LP Polygon tokens are being considered for potential addition as collateral in the Aave market. We can also expect potential CRV rewards on Polygon LP positions if the DAO decides to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to implement this strategy by keeping the tokens used as collateral on the L1 Aave in order to benefit from the mining of StkAAVE. It will be necessary to migrate the borrowed stablecoins from the Ethereum network to Polygon using for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matic&amp;rsquo;s POS bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protect-yourself-against-the-price-risk-of-the--farming-in-&#34;&gt;Protect yourself against the price risk of the $: farming in €.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, everything is done in dollars. It makes sense, everyone knows, but for a European user it is a significant additional  risk. Indeed, if your ambition is to generate enough to live on with DeFi, then this means your output will eventually be in Euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/eur-usd-1y.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eur-usd-1y&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a European farmer, it may therefore be &lt;strong&gt;interesting to have a DeFi exposure in € to avoid this risk&lt;/strong&gt;. At the moment, there are simply no Euro borrowing options other than &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mimo.capital/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mimo Capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service allows you to borrow PAR from ETH, wBTC or USDC. The MIMO governance token is also distributed to owners of active vaults as well as to liquidity providers on the PAR/ETH and PAR/USDC Balancer pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the protocol is still recent and the PAR token is not yet supported in the ecosystem, as a collateral on Aave or in a Curve pool for example. So the situation is not yet ideal but it has the merit to exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other DeFi-€ solutions are in development. MakerDAO, for example, has mentioned a Euro-DAI, while Jarvis Network is working on a synthetic stablecoin €, the jEUR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-1&#34;&gt;How-to
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To farm natively in Euros, the best option is still what you can do with EURS. Since the launch of the pool on Curve, there are many options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Owning EURS / sEUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 month - years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result:&lt;/strong&gt; Growing a capital in Euro-stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Enabler:&lt;/strong&gt; Owning VeCRVs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/EURS-farming-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;pool Curve&lt;/strong&gt; directly offers an attractive yield in CRV even when it is not boosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To automatically sell the farmed CRVs to compound the return, a vault is ideal. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yearn.finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn&lt;/a&gt; offers a vault on EURS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming is also possible via the EURS vault of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;StakeDAO&lt;/a&gt;, in order to accumulate SDT as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt; also offers a vault that makes up the bulk of the returns while paying in FARM.&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/sky/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt; are the heart of the DeFi ecosystem. For the final user, these protocols have the same function than a classic bank : borrowing or putting sleepy money at work by lendind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;the analogy stops immediately at this functional comparison&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the underlying logic of money markets has nothing to do with the functioning of a bank. Money markets benefit from all the advantages of DeFi and, in particular, the transparency and accessibility of all operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user borrows on Aave, &lt;strong&gt;the protocol does not need to know his age or identity&lt;/strong&gt;: validate all conditions is enough ! It means that you just have to put enough collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a user who deposits stablecoins on Aave to generate a return by lending them to others does not trust anyone: he can check at any time which amounts are borrowed by each address to &lt;strong&gt;ensure the solvency of the entire system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem basic to a DeFian, but it is a real paradigm shift. In traditional finance, we have no choice but to trust a third party (auditor, rating agency, etc.) to obtain this kind of information - with the reliability that we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-money-markets&#34;&gt;Discovering money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already talked a lot about money markets on this blog, especially in the article that offers a qualitative methodology to evaluate their risks : &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the one about the different services of abstraction and distribution of the inherent risks in money markets: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, money markets are constantly evolving, both through their updates and through the contribution of third-party services built on top. In addition, new and more challenging money markets are being launched to cover needs that are still unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is precisely our purpose today: &lt;strong&gt;understanding the essential innovations underway in money markets in order to better envision their future development.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than making an exhaustive list, I propose to look at a selection of projects that I think are relevant to understanding the industry evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-built-on-existing-money-markets&#34;&gt;Innovations built on existing money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets may seem really complex at first glance. The curious are most often frightened by the risks of liquidating the collateral when its value is no longer sufficient to secure the borrowed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;easy-loan-positions-management-with-defisaver&#34;&gt;Easy loan positions management with DeFiSaver
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many DeFi users have not yet fully understood the issues at stake here. Many still think that liquidation can be total and sudden. In addition to information and education, tools for managing one&amp;rsquo;s positions help users to feel more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, tools that facilitate and automate the management of borrowing positions on money markets have emerged very quickly, such as DeFi Saver. I already talked about it last year in this article &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/leveraging-ETH.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFiSaver works as a proxy between the user and money markets. It allows new features such as the well-loved &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo;: when the position falls below a user-defined collateralization limit, DeFiSaver automatically rebalances the position with a flash loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In concrete terms, this function sells a part of the user&amp;rsquo;s collateral to pay off some debt and return to a collateralization ratio decided earlier. Such a tool allows the most aggressive or worried borrowers to sleep much more peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reclaiming-liquidation-with-bprotocol&#34;&gt;Reclaiming liquidation with B.Protocol
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although DeFiSaver is very useful, it remains a tool that does not fundamentally change the way the underlying services work. Other projects go further, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BProtocol&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is very simple: instead of borrowing directly from Maker, the user goes through the BProtocol contract. Funds available to the protocol allows it to &lt;strong&gt;liquidate the user&amp;rsquo;s position (if necessary) before other liquidators do so.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/bprotocolexplainer.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bprotocol explainer&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is usually a gas war between different liquidators becomes a more predictable operation. It also allows &lt;strong&gt;redistributing part of the liquidation premium to the user himself rather than to the miners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If the value of the collateral is too low compared to the borrowed amount, a liquidation is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually this liquidation is at the expense of another type of user who gets paid (premium liquidation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea, simple at a high level, is nonetheless very reassuring for users while allowing for &amp;ldquo;professionalization&amp;rdquo; of liquidations which become more predictable. There are now about $100M of assets managed by the protocol which already covers Maker and Compound (Aave is coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-of-the-makerdao-model&#34;&gt;Innovations of the MakerDAO model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakerDAO is probably the best-known money market, but it is also a special one. Indeed, MakerDAO serves a dual function: the service allows borrowing just like Aave or Compound, however &lt;strong&gt;no one lends you anything when you borrow on Maker - borrowers directly mint a currency (DAI) that corresponds to their debt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, while allowing borrowing, MakerDAO also produces a stable asset, the DAI, which is indexed on dollar. Although DAI has its limitations, it is less centralized and requires less trust than stablecoin models like USDC. This is why Maker&amp;rsquo;s model has been taken up many times to serve new purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mimo-capital-down-with-the-dollar-up-with-the-euro&#34;&gt;Mimo Capital: down with the dollar, up with the euro!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the dollar has been the reference fiat currency for DeFi. Almost all stablecoin projects aim to produce an asset that tracks the value of the dollar. In addition, it is also the dollar value of volatile assets that is considered by borrowing systems to determine the collateralization ratio, both on Maker and Compound or Aave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar being the most common and best known fiat currency, it made sense to start with but it is time to go beyond that to meet the needs of all types of users and make DeFi more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what a project like Mimo Capital is looking for, as it proposes &lt;strong&gt;a system similar to MakerDAO but where the Euro is the base currency&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of the dollar. This means that the stablecoin produced by the borrowers - the PAR - follows the Euro, but also that the internal prices of the system are in €, as the value of the collateral used (ETH, wBTC or USDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/mimo-capital-par.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mimo-Capital-PAR&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimo is not coming up in an empty market as Euro stablecoins are beginning to emerge. In addition to Mimo&amp;rsquo;s PAR, there is the EURS stablecoin which follows a centralized model: each EURS in circulation is backed by a Euro fiat owned by the issuer. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;yield opportunities are starting to emerge via Euro exposures&lt;/strong&gt;, for example the sEUR/EURS pool on Curve also accessible via vaults on StakeDAO or Harvest Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of &lt;strong&gt;a protocol like Mimo allows European investors to consider a circuit with the Euro as the reference currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Using their ETH or wBTC as collateral, they can borrow PAR (stablecoin €) and make it productive via, for now, two liquidity pools on Balancer, but eventually, probably more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimo is still a fairly new system with approximately €25 million of collateral deposited as collateral for approximately 12.5 million PARs issued (€). The governance token associated with the service - MIMO - is currently distributed to any active vault holder as well as to liquidity providers on the PAR/ETH and PAR/USDC pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-fiat-currencies-with-reflexer&#34;&gt;Beyond fiat currencies with Reflexer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching from dollar to euro is good, going completely without a fiat currency reference is even better&lt;/strong&gt; This is exactly what Reflexer, another service inspired by the Maker model, offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reference price here. The price of the RAI (borrower-generated asset) is governed directly by the market (average price on the RAI/ETH pair). The system also has its &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; price, the &lt;em&gt;Redemption Price&lt;/em&gt; - the rate used when users directly mint RAI (by depositing ETH as collateral).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/raiprice.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;reflexer RAI price&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various parameters in the Reflexer system adjust to &lt;strong&gt;converge the two prices over time, or at least keep them within a narrow range&lt;/strong&gt;. While this approach is much more difficult for the user to learn, it is completely uncorrelated with the dollar (or any other fiat currency), which is valuable in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand Reflexer, I recommend you to read my previous article on stable assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-generation-of-money-markets&#34;&gt;New generation of money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have considered innovations built on the existing core money markets or directly inspired by their models. There is also a whole new wave of money markets exploring different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore propose to consider two final projects that bring real fundamental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alchemix-productive-assets-as-collateral&#34;&gt;Alchemix: productive assets as collateral?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t start this section with another project than Alchemix! The idea of this project is as simple as powerful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if, instead of taking non-productive collateral, we only took productive collateral &lt;strong&gt;like a stablecoin that produces a return ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our collateral now has a return: what if the return on the collateral &lt;strong&gt;was used to pay off the loan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there you have it: &lt;strong&gt;A loan that pays for itself over time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/alchemix.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Alchemix overview&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemix launched by accepting yDAI (DAI deposited on Yearn Finance) as collateral. Depositors can borrow up to 50% of the value of their yDAI in AlUSD, another stablecoin dollar. T&lt;strong&gt;heir collateral is not at risk, and the loan pays for itself through the interest generated by the yDAI: it takes about 3 years at the current return rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemix quickly became a very popular service, especially for &lt;strong&gt;proceeding large purchases without spending crypto&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of patience. Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Bob, a DeFi farmer who has worked hard: he now wants to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He wants to raise $50,000 to buy a car. Rather than taking $50,000 directly from his assets, Bob can achieve the same result without spending anything thanks to Alchemix :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob deposits 100,000 DAI on Alchemix, which are then deployed on Yearn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows him to borrow up to 50,000 AlUSD, which he can use to buy his car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob just has to wait while the yDAI returns pay back his loan. In ~3 years, once the debt is paid off, he can get his original 100,000 DAI back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such flow allows to spend immediately without any other cost than the fact of locking about 2 times the amount mobilized within Alchemix.&lt;/strong&gt; The future of programmable money is live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so powerful and innovative that many still find it hard to believe. The feedback from Alchemix users still attracts many skeptics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity-efficiency-at-all-costs&#34;&gt;Liquity: efficiency at all costs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is another money market that innovates on several levels. The fundamental concept to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;liquidations are automated and therefore much more predictable and quick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; to offer &lt;strong&gt;lower collateralization ratios&lt;/strong&gt; than other systems, or to put it another way: Liquity users can raise more dollars per ETH deposited than on a system like Maker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum loan-to-value ratio (maximum LTV) determines the borrowing power of a collateral. A maximum loan-to-value of 50% means that up to half of the dollar value of the deposited collateral can be borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maker : minimal ratio = 150% ⇒ approximately 66% max LTV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity : Collateralisation minimal ratio = 110% ⇒ approximately 90% max LTV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity also innovates on the fees side since &lt;strong&gt;the loans are interest free&lt;/strong&gt; unlike other systems. On Maker/ETH for example, the stability fee is 5.5%. If you borrow 10,000 DAI today, you will have to pay back 10,550 DAI in 1 year (if the fees do not change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/liquity.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is no stability fee on Liquity. Instead, users pay &lt;strong&gt;a one-time, immediate fee when borrowing&lt;/strong&gt;. This fee depends on the &amp;ldquo;base rate&amp;rdquo; which is governed by the protocol directly. It is currently 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Liquity, those who deposit ETH to mint LUSD can then deploy them into the Stability Pool (LUSD) or the LUSD/ETH pair for remuneration in LQTY - the service&amp;rsquo;s native token.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The LQTY can then be staked to &lt;strong&gt;get a share of the LUSD paid to the protocol when a loan is contracted&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the redemption fee (ETH ↔ LUSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity is a so-called &amp;ldquo;governance mimized&amp;rdquo; platform - LQTY is therefore not a governance token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Liquity also innovates in terms of decentralization since &lt;strong&gt;the interface used to access the service is not managed by the team behind the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;. Different frontends operated by third parties are offered while the team focuses on the protocol itself. This ensures that many mirrors exist so that the service is always easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you have found this introduction to the latest innovations in the money markets informative. I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to see the offering growing and becoming denser to cover ever more varied needs. Money markets are essential elements of DeFi, and with the growth of the space, they will become more and more preponderant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me remind you that in addition to functionality, &lt;strong&gt;risk management is the essential element that differentiates each money market&lt;/strong&gt;. Before you start spending large sums of money on them, I invite you to familiarize yourself with the associated risks. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, I wrote what remains to this day &lt;strong&gt;the most exhaustive and comprehensible synthesis to understand the risks incurred in the money markets&lt;/strong&gt;, I invite you to read it:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp; endgame</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/ethereum-stable-assets/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/ethereum-stable-assets/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/money-god-meme.png" alt="Featured image of post Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp; endgame" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to cover an essential topic for Ethereum and other blockchains and often misunderstood: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; assets&lt;/strong&gt;, which track the price of a reference asset. Before looking at the different approaches to producing such an asset, we&amp;rsquo;ll first start with a higher level of analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are such assets needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are they used for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we want to standardize non-native Ethereum assets on this chain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these foundations are established, we will have all the tools to &lt;strong&gt;figure out the different methods and what is at stake&lt;/strong&gt;.. I will conclude with a more detailed analysis of a project that seems to me very relevant and innovative : the RAI of Reflexer Labs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already familiar with the different pegging mechanisms, you can jump &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;#focus-on-reflexers-rai&#34; &gt;directly to the section on Reflexer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-standardization-on-the-ethereums-blockchain&#34;&gt;Assets standardization on the Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of issuance and use of pegged-assets has exploded last year, but before we look at what they are actually used for, let&amp;rsquo;s understand why. The simplest use case is to produce a stable asset, most often indexed to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, &lt;strong&gt;the method used at a high level is tokenization&lt;/strong&gt;: we represent an asset that comes from another chain / world on Ethereum, such as wBTC (corresponding to 1 BTC on the Bitcoin chain) or USDC (corresponding to 1 USD in Circle&amp;rsquo;s bank account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;addresses one of the most common concerns for the general public: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cryptos are volatile assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;the rise of stablecoins has gone hand in hand with the rise of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;, why? According to me, there are many reasons, the main ones being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable assets can be very productive in DeFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-borrowings-mostly-in-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Why are borrowings mostly in stablecoins?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money markets allow their users to borrow assets using other assets as collateral. The most frequent use case corresponds to the following pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user deposits a volatile asset, such as ETH, wBTC or LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He uses it as collateral to &lt;strong&gt;borrow a stable asset, like USDC or DAI&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so? To put it simply, few people are fond of the risks associated with price changes. &lt;strong&gt;Borrowing an asset, if you then mobilize it, is like shorting it&lt;/strong&gt;. No problem with stablecoins - in theory - but the reality is quite different with a non-stable asset: if the price goes down, good for you: the debt will only be cheaper to repay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other way around, the scenario can be frightening since &lt;strong&gt;you can end up with a debt that increases&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you borrow 1000 UNI when one UNI is worth $20. You sell them for another token, for example stablecoins. So here you are with $20,000 DAI that you mobilize in DeFi for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hold your debt for several months and now you want to pay it off. Except that one UNI is now worth $30 and you no longer have any: you have to buy some back on the markets to pay off the debt and close the position. &lt;strong&gt;The debt is always paid in the borrowed asset&lt;/strong&gt;: you therefore owe 1,000 UNIs at $30 per unit or 30,000 DAI.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality you should pay back slightly more UNI, according to the interest rate and the length of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield-farming-with-stable-assets&#34;&gt;Yield-farming with stable-assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the first point understood, the second one makes perfect sense.: &lt;strong&gt;a lot of people are borrowing stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt;, so that means that on the other side of the market people are lending them out, for attractive interest rates considering the demand. For example, on Aave, one of the main money markets, there has been &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity crunch in stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; almost since the launch of v2. Depositors enjoy an average annualized return of about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is quite similar elsewhere with differences due to the specificities of each money market. Nevertheless, the liquidity crisis on stablecoins goes far beyond Aave: it potentially extends to the whole DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;there is no shortage of opportunities to produce a return with stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about loans here, but it is also possible to bring liquidity to stablecoin pairs and even combine the two approaches to increase returns with a product like Curve:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explosion-of-the-pegged-assets-use-in-2020&#34;&gt;Explosion of the pegged-assets use in 2020
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we have seen a real explosion in the issuance and use of pegged-assets in 2020. On the one hand, more and more projects are being launched to propose &lt;strong&gt;new asset types or new approaches to represent them&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, the scenarios for using these pegged-assets are multiplying thanks to the growth of Curve money markets, vaults like those offered by Yearn or Harvest, and other even more complex DeFi products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name but one, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://alchemix.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alchemix&lt;/a&gt;, a new synthetic asset service that allows &lt;strong&gt;loans secured by your future return&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me explain: with Alchemix, everything starts with a stable asset that produces a return. They chose the yDAI to start with (DAI productive thanks to the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s vault).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user starts by depositing yDAI. He can then &lt;strong&gt;give up his future return&lt;/strong&gt; to borrow up to 50% of the deposited value. His loan is &lt;strong&gt;reimbursed automatically thanks to the interest generated by the yDAI&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, since he has access to 50% of the deposited value immediately (borrowed in alUSD), he can put it to work to increase the return of the entire strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of product allows for an interesting across time arbitrage and leads to an even greater demand for stablecoins: at the launch of Alchemix, deposits in the yDAI vault took off up to the maximum capacity available for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about stablecoins so far, but a similar scenario has played out on other pegged-assets like tokenized BTC on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/stablecoin-growth.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;stablecoin-growth-ethereum-messari&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the impressive growth of DeFi, we can only expect the demand for this type of asset to grow ever faster. So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the different approaches used to produce them to understand their trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-different-methods-to-produce-pegged-assets&#34;&gt;The different methods to produce pegged-assets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the vast majority of this demand for stable assets is being addressed with solutions based on a 1:1 match requiring trust. Thus, it is &lt;strong&gt;mostly USDT ($38.5B issued) and USDC ($9.4B) that are leading the way&lt;/strong&gt;, well ahead of DAI ($2.7B). The same goes for Bitcoin, without going into detail, all the most used solutions require trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegged-assets&amp;quot; are assets that follow the price of another via a mechanism called &amp;ldquo;pegging&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, the &amp;ldquo;peg&amp;rdquo; is the value that the asset must maintain, for example $1 for stablecoins that follow the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing variety of approaches are being explored to produce a pegged-asset with less compromise. They are generally grouped into large families that correspond to the main method used to maintain the peg. However, as these approaches develop, the boundaries between them become blurred as several projects explore &lt;strong&gt;hybrid approaches mixing several elements of each&lt;/strong&gt;. We will start from the simplest to understand and progressively go to the most complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-a-trusted-third-party-11-ratio&#34;&gt;Using a trusted third party (1:1 ratio)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The peg is easily maintained and rather stable. The system is solvent at all times (-&amp;gt; 1 USD in the bank for 1 USDC issued for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The system requires a central trusted intermediary - the issuing organization. This same organization relies on another intermediary, the bank where the USD are deposited. In addition, the presence of a trusted intermediary creates a risk: is it reliable? transparent? The risk goes beyond image, it can also be legal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has already been detailed enough, so I&amp;rsquo;ll move on to the more complex methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins-produced-by-over-collateralization-maker-dai&#34;&gt;Stablecoins produced by over-collateralization: Maker DAI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The system no longer involves a central trusted intermediary (at least initially) &amp;amp; still manages to more or less maintain the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; It will require &lt;strong&gt;always more $ collateral than $ (DAI) produced (over-collateralization)&lt;/strong&gt;. Governance risks. Risks at the liquidation level, carried out by third parties. The system is as trustless as its most used collateral. Maker now accepts censorable collateral (wBTC, USDC, etc.) which reintroduces a trust risk into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before algorithmic stablecoins, MakerDAO is a pioneer when thinking about how to &lt;strong&gt;produce a stable asset with less trust needed in the system than 1:1 approaches&lt;/strong&gt;. Maker is a more complex service because beyond the DAI - the stablecoin issued by the system, it also allows its users to use different assets to borrow (technically mint) DAIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it recreates risks and dangers to maintain the peg of the DAI. Many improvements have been proposed and implemented since the beginning, which allows DAI to be much more stable now than in its early days. Nevertheless, the scaling of DAI has come with additional compromises in terms of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-innovative-approaches&#34;&gt;More innovative approaches
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the approaches are more diversified - I group them into two families: the algorithmic approaches already well studied on my blog and the hybrid approaches. Both are based on an essential concept to understand: the &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; of these systems is a smart contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-smart-contract-as-central-bank&#34;&gt;A smart contract as &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the words &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; because it evokes the essential concept here: the body that issues money and implements the monetary policy of the system is a smart contract. This allows for great transparency and visibility on the actions related to monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the systems presented below, you really need to understand this: &lt;strong&gt;the decisions to create or destroy new stablecoins are &amp;ldquo;taken&amp;rdquo; by a smart contract&lt;/strong&gt; - it alone has this ability to issue (and destroy / burn in some systems) tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say that the smart contract takes &amp;ldquo;decisions&amp;rdquo;, I must explain myself : &lt;strong&gt;to be more precise, one could say that it reacts to the evolution of various measurable parameters&lt;/strong&gt;. The decisions of the smart contract are therefore transparent and predictable. A change in the rules governing it is possible but only via a governance vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often, the main parameter taken into account is simply &lt;strong&gt;the price of the stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, in early algorithmic systems like Basis (BAC is the stablecoin), the rules are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If BAC &amp;gt; $1, then the system issues and distributes new BAC to try to bring the price back towards $1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When BAC &amp;lt; $1 the system destroys BAC to create upward pressure. The destruction is not direct but voluntary: the actors in the system are encouraged to burn their BAC for a coupon (BAB) corresponding to 1 BAC + premium, which they can collect only when BAC has a sustained price above the dollar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more background on this &amp;ldquo;smart contract central bank&amp;rdquo; idea, you can read my first article on algorithmic stablecoins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;L&amp;rsquo;état et le futur des stablecoins algorithmiques&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;algorithmic-approaches&#34;&gt;Algorithmic approaches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; This makes systems without a central trust intermediary possible and thus opens the way to truly trustless pegged-assets. Community governance possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Sustained peg loss or difficulty maintaining peg. Possible governance attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I analyze the main approaches to produce algorithmic stablecoins in a dedicated article :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖ L&amp;rsquo;histoire de deux modèles de seigneuriage : Basis contre ESD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, projects like ESD, DSD, or Basis Cash were the pioneers of algorithmic stablecoins. However, all of these systems are now in a bit of an abyss: &lt;strong&gt;their stablecoins have been worth well under a dollar for a long time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/bac-90days.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bac-price-90d&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their users are looking forward to a V2 that will bring stablecoin back to the dollar like the messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hybrid-approaches&#34;&gt;Hybrid approaches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The best of both worlds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages / Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; A new potentially central and  intermediate point of trust appears in the system. You what happened next&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current limitations of first generation algorithmic stablecoins, another approach has successfully emerged: the hybrid approach.  These are intrinsically algorithmic systems that &lt;strong&gt;include nonetheless a reserve in stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. (different from the system) used to maintain the peg: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://samkazemian.medium.com/frax-v2-algorithmic-market-operations-b84521ed7133&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneer in this field is Frax. With Frax, &lt;strong&gt;when FRAX trades above the dollar the system itself sells some to accumulate USDC&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps to bring the price down while building up a reserve of stablecoins not exposed to the system itself. Thus, if FRAX is trading &lt;strong&gt;below the dollar, the system can buy FRAX directly&lt;/strong&gt; on the market (using its stock of USDC) to bring the price back down to $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/frax-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;frax-price-90d&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach has the &lt;strong&gt;merit of efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (FRAX has maintained its peg very well since launch), it reintroduces a trusted intermediary into the mechanism. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not a bank like with Tether, but it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary trust in the system. What happens if the USDC balance of Frax is seized or frozen: could the system survive it? For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, yes it is technically (and legally) possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain very high-level on FRAX and describe the system mostly as it was in the beginning. Many integrations have been implemented or are being considered, such as the ability to mint FRAX directly into the FRAX-Tornado anonymity set (directly into TornadoCash) to offer a potentially more confidential stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-reflexers-rai&#34;&gt;Focus on Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To finish this article, which I hope will be instructive, I suggest to analyze an innovative system: Reflexer RAI. It is a similar approach to MakerDAO, in the sense that the stable asset is produced by over-collateralization. Nevertheless, it brings many improvements over the Maker model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trustless collateral&lt;/strong&gt;: Until now, RAI only accepts ETH as collateral. This means that 100% of the collaterals in the system are not censurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the dollar&lt;/strong&gt;: the asset produced by the system does not follow the dollar (which is not really stable itself). The price of the RAI is determined by a consensus established by the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Money God&lt;/strong&gt; : just like algorithmic stablecoins, the system reacts to different observed parameters. However, just like MakerDAO, here it is the users themselves who directly hit the RAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt; : the token of the Reflexer system (FLX), which will be distributed to the users, is intended to be used to progressively decentralize the governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t panic if you don&amp;rsquo;t immediately understand why this system is innovative and significant, we will explore each of these points in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;censorship-resistant-collateral&#34;&gt;Censorship-resistant collateral
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initially, MakerDAO only accepted Ether as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;. With the first significant update of the system - the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/White%20Paper%20-The%20Maker%20Protocol_%20MakerDAO%E2%80%99s%20Multi-Collateral%20Dai%20%28MCD%29%20System-FINAL-%20021720.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Multi Collateral DAI&lt;/a&gt; - more tokens became usable as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community was perplexed by this decision, especially because of the choice of accepted tokens. Thus, BAT was one of the first new collateral while LINK, a token with volume and liquidity already far superior to BAT at the time, only arrived much later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this &lt;strong&gt;difficult to understand valuation&lt;/strong&gt;, the crux of the problem is that &lt;strong&gt;many collaterals now accepted are censorable&lt;/strong&gt;: wBTC, RenBTC, USDC, TUSD, etc. This reduces the trustlessness of MakerDAO since at different times up to 50% of all DAIs were minted from censorable collaterals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure is now reduced, but the concern remains. Furthermore, the addition of a special USDC vault was criticized during Black Thursday for helping DAI regain its peg - but it also made MakerDAO even more dependent on such collaterals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Reflexer also fits in as &lt;strong&gt;a reaction to this &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; of MakerDAO&lt;/strong&gt;: for now, only ETH is accepted to open a vault. I will be surprised if the team or the DAO vote to accept censorable collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-the-us-dollar&#34;&gt;Beyond the US Dollar
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Reflexer goes much further than DAI in its quest for stability. Indeed, the dollar itself does not have a stable value, because of the continuous production of new units which leads to inflation: thus $10,000 in 1950 is equivalent in purchasing power to almost $110,000 in 2021 (3.42% inflation per year on average over the period).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An asset that is intended to be stable must therefore go beyond the limitations of the dollar and this is precisely what RAI does&lt;/strong&gt;: it does not follow the price of the dollar. The price of RAI is determined by pure social consensus: the system takes into account the observed price of the ETH/RAI pair (market price) as well as an internal price target (redemption rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often gaps between the two, which creates an incentive to beat the RAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/reflexer-spread.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;reflexer-spread&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, RAI is obviously not a stablecoin, It is not a pegged-asset either&lt;/strong&gt;. There are not enough words to describe RAI accurately, but let me try. RAI is an abstraction on the ETH which is intended to be more stable than the ETH, while maintaining its trustlessness (with time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-hail-the-money-god&#34;&gt;All Hail the Money God
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Money God&amp;rdquo; is the term used to refer to the set of rules that govern the Reflexer system. The memetic potential is also enormous. To remain quite synthetic, the Money God is lenient towards those who follow a perennial and long-term logic on the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the distribution mechanism of the Reflexer token, FLX, was recently modified to better align incentives (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info here&lt;/a&gt;). The essence of the change is to better compensate those who perpetuate the system, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH to mint RAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the RAI minted + the equivalent in ETH in the liquidity pool on Uniswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 8, 100% of FLX is being distributed to those who follow this scenario. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/stefanionescu/e66204be990f4bc113a022341cb39186&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The history of FLX retroactive distribution strategies is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-de-governance-plan&#34;&gt;The De-Governance Plan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the important technical innovation on Reflexer, barely explored here, I particularly appreciate &lt;strong&gt;their approach to governance and decentralization of the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, as described by Stefan one of its architects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The principle of “ungovernance” comes from our desire to progressively remove human control from the RAI system, thus making it socially scalable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has established &lt;strong&gt;a plan with concrete and dated goals&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve this end. The first step is to make the system&amp;rsquo;s liquidation and taxation mechanisms &amp;ldquo;governance minimized&amp;rdquo; - only a few parameters will remain changeable via governance (voting of FLX holders) from this point on. The target date is April 17, 2022, a little over a year after the initial launch of RAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each step, the scenario is similar: a critical mechanism of the system is &amp;ldquo;governance-minimized&amp;rdquo; before it is put back under the full control of FLX holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the details of this plan here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following and waiting for Reflexer for over a year, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to finally tell you about it, and please forgive me for the delay: I wanted to put it in context to make sure everyone grasps the innovation brought by this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article &lt;strong&gt;does not constitute investment advice&lt;/strong&gt;. I have no credentials in this area: they do not yet exist for DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am discussing the mechanics of several protocols and what they allow for or envision in the future. Even if I mention tokens, ditto: I discuss their utility or tokenomics but &lt;strong&gt;never their relevance as an investment&lt;/strong&gt;. On this topic, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helps you better understand the rise of pegged-assets on Ethereum - it is essential. It&amp;rsquo;s also critical to understand the different trade-off sets associated with each approach: they are all potentially more or less relevant, depending on your situation and needs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whether you are convinced by Reflexer or not, I strongly encourage you to dig into this system, just as I regularly invite you to explore the workings of Aave, Curve or Unslashed. All four are very relevant and innovative systems: understanding them in depth will allow you to internalize many essential things  to understand decentralized finance in general.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/money-markets-risk/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/money-markets-risk/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/risk-tranching/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets are at the heart of DeFi. From a high-level perspective, yes, they simply enable the borrowing and lending of various assets. Yet &lt;strong&gt;those functions are like the two primitive verbs of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; at the base of pretty much all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three major money markets right now in DeFi: Aave, Compound &amp;amp; Cream. Yet all the following services use them, one way or another: Yearn Finance, Curve Finance, Alpha Finance, Harvest Finance, DeFiSaver, Saffron, 88MPH, Idle Finance, etc. To put it simply - &lt;strong&gt;money markets are one of the root-level of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money markets are amazing - simple yet very intricate. In this article, I try to provide a framework and some clues to assess the risk at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dive more into the service layer currently being built on top of money markets, feel free to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-risk-scoring-is-broken&#34;&gt;I/ Risk Scoring is Broken
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the risk analysis framework, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly discuss the current leading solution used to evaluate risk in DeFi: Consensys CodeFi DeFiScore.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeFiScore is undisputedly compromised since it&amp;rsquo;s still giving DAI a higher rate on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/compound-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; even with the oracle failure on the Compound side and the arrival of the Safety Module on Aave&amp;rsquo;s side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consensys CodeFi team was notified a few days ago&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, acknowledged the issue&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but yet &lt;strong&gt;refused any immediate to update the website even with just notice or disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, one of their members proposed a 500 USDC bounty open for anyone willing to update the formula&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It has yet to be claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that quantitative approaches so far have failed. They must achieve both sustainability (if the formula stays consistent it allows historical comparisons) and adaptability (yet the risk parameters are always evolving): it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not delve into the depths of risk scoring, as there is a dedicated article exploring what a decent DeFi-native risk scoring system looks like coming out shortly on this blog (hint: it does not exist yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-appreciating-the-safety-of-a-money-market&#34;&gt;II/ Appreciating the Safety of a Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s painful to hear, but since quantitative analysis is unhelpful, you have to resort to a qualitative approaches for each project. The good news is there aren&amp;rsquo;t many money markets in DeFi worth looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream / Iron Bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these, you have to look at them holistically. I propose an approach that is &lt;strong&gt;purely mine&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;8 different dimensions all critical to the safety of assets&lt;/strong&gt; committed to the money market analyzed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocol access &amp;amp; permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collateral listing &amp;amp; risk analysis&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost no one is qualified to assess risks in DeFi: even &amp;ldquo;institutions&amp;rdquo; doing it like the DeFiscore are way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This content is intended to help you better understand and appreciate the risk &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;by yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the most reliable way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iia-protocol-access--permissions&#34;&gt;II.A/ Protocol Access &amp;amp; Permissions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very base level, you want to know who can update the protocol core parameters (-&amp;gt; the contracts), and the different limits associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s usually a &lt;strong&gt;timelock&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that any significant change only applies after a set duration. For the administrative functions of the protocol, you need to make sure that they are &lt;strong&gt;community-owned&lt;/strong&gt;, which usually means &lt;strong&gt;governed by a multisig&lt;/strong&gt; of designed community members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section also includes everything related to &lt;strong&gt;the &amp;ldquo;opsec&amp;rdquo; of the wallets/people&lt;/strong&gt; governing the multisig. &amp;ldquo;Opsec&amp;rdquo; is short for &amp;ldquo;operations security&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s about the safety of everything digital interfaces related to the holders of these keys. Can they be hacked? Impersonated? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a matter is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as we saw recently with the CEO of Nexus Mutual: his laptop was compromised, allowing the hacker to submit a fraudulent transaction on top of a real transaction he signed.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have yet to see significant attacks based on social engineering in DeFi but expect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency on the decisions of the protocol is key too: we address it below in the community &amp;amp; DAO section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on mature money markets like Aave or Compound. Newer projects might be less decentralized, and that can be a good thing - you might want some control and rollback options for a newer project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Chris Blec&lt;/a&gt; is your guy. He&amp;rsquo;s uncompromising on opsec, and produced many helpful contributions on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13S7NRk1girTdQMajnVdU5JRlVO5BG_uJKhTO2Ef10b0/edit?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;summarized overview of the situation for the main DeFi projects here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to wrap this up, here are some good questions to ask to assess the safety of a money market at the protocol &amp;amp; permission level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can update the contracts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they have a credible opsec?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any drain function in the contracts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do the administrative functions do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How decentralized is the process to create a new lending market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iib-oracles&#34;&gt;II.B/ Oracles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the oracles are the source for &amp;ldquo;outside truths&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Blockchains are only aware of themselves&lt;/strong&gt;, so for Ethereum, the price of ETH in dollars (or any other token) is technically an &amp;ldquo;outside truth&amp;rdquo; you need to bring on-chain in a &lt;strong&gt;safe and verifiable manner&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s precisely what oracles do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s essential, as the &lt;strong&gt;perceived price&lt;/strong&gt; delivered by the oracle is the &lt;strong&gt;source of truth for the protocol&amp;rsquo;s liquidation decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. If the oracle says DAI is worth 1.30, then you are liquidated even if your DAI-borrowing position was safe on a $1 DAI and DAI is still actually worth $1 on the markets: the oracle is the source of truth. It happened already with Compound, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a theoretical concern.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news here is that the answer is quite simple: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ChainLink&lt;/a&gt; is widely recognized as the most credible decentralized oracle solution, so any money market not using at least partly their price feeds is gambling with its users&amp;rsquo; money, as Compound did with significant lossses. It seems like the situation has not improved - despite the failure Compound still uses the same centralized oracle (Coinbase) and a proposal suggesting a switch to ChainLink was refused. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-oracles&#34;&gt;Assessing oracles
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Significant (most impacting sub-theme to date).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: market-based, potentially whole markets can be drained/affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, on Compound.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can assess the oracles for a money market with the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the source of truth for prices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How reliable is that source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any history of abusive liquidation (stemming from oracle issues)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iic-liquidation-mechanisms&#34;&gt;II.C/ Liquidation Mechanisms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liquidation mechanisms are critical too, but they only happen once a liquidation can be triggered - which depends on the price the oracle returns. So the &lt;strong&gt;liquidation mechanism cannot make up for a faulty oracle&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to first understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, different money markets handle liquidations differently. They have different delays, fees, and restrictions with their liquidations. For instance, the Maker oracle/liquidation (internal system) has a one-hour delay to prevent flash liquidations during unsustained flash crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, liquidation is not sudden neither an all-or-nothing event. There are several buffers to your positions, for instance on Aave, every token has a &lt;strong&gt;maximum loan to value&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;liquidation threshold&lt;/strong&gt;at least slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with USDC as collateral, for instance, there is a 5% spread between the two - the max LTV is 80% (&lt;em&gt;max $8000 worth borrowed from a 10 000 USDC collateral&lt;/em&gt;), while the liquidation threshold is 85% (&lt;em&gt;= liquidation if collateral value &amp;lt; $8500&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-risks/aave-usdc.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Aave USDC collateral parameters&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives borrowers using USDC as collateral another 5% margin so that even if the oracle reports $0.97 no abusive liquidations would occur. The situation is similar in other money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-liquidation-mechanisms&#34;&gt;Assessing liquidation mechanisms
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly depends on the collateral price action - a flash crash could trigger a chain of liquidations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Significant (the money market can be potentially undercollateralized)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, on Maker where there were issues and delays with liquidations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some questions to ask yourself to assess the liquidation mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When liquidations are triggered; what is the flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any additional delay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the liquidation fees?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another massive subtopic here: the &lt;strong&gt;liquidations do not happen magically&lt;/strong&gt; - they are triggered by other users. So the incentives need to be on point there too so that liquidations do happen when needed and promptly. This topic is even more complex now in an age of high gas costs (liquidation profits vs gas costs of the tx). Skipping it for digestibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iid-collateral-listing--risk-analysis&#34;&gt;II.D/ Collateral Listing &amp;amp; Risk Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that we have a money market getting reliable prices and liquidating when needed, we can start looking at the tokens accepted as collateral and what is the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing a token&amp;rsquo;s health and overall safety is &lt;strong&gt;one of the most complex tasks nowadays in DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; because figuring out the whole ecosystem around a token can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the SNX token, for instance, a major ERC-20 token. It&amp;rsquo;s usable as collateral on Aave, but with quite a low maximum loan to value ratio (to be raised soon?) at 15%. Other ERC-20 tokens like LINK are in the 60-75% range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without diving too much into the details, this has to do with what you can do with each token and &lt;strong&gt;SNX usage as collateral on the Synthetix platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;Aave&amp;rsquo;s risk parameters are conservative enough to essentially &amp;ldquo;front-run&amp;rdquo; Synthetix itself in the chain of liquidations if a black swan event was to happen &lt;/span&gt;on Synthetix. It seems wise: a money market should not want to take higher exposition on a given token than the native platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is the other way around: assess the overall &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; of the latest tokens added as collateral on the platform: are they liquid? Credibly decentralized? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also look at the overall collateral usage for any suspicious mismatch, like on Cream where almost a third of the deposits are FTT tokens (FTX exchange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-risks/cream.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Cream&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-the-collateral-listing-strategy&#34;&gt;Assessing the collateral listing strategy
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Depends on the collateral listing strategy risk appetite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: If a dangerous token is accepted as collateral, the money market can potentially ends-up undercollateralized or even drained. For instance, Cream accepts COVER as collateral. The token suffered three infinite mint attacks already, exposing Cream to further risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❌Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; some tokens got minted to infinity, like COVER&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But they were used as collateral on a money market yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t expand more on this topic since Aave&amp;rsquo;s risk documentation is very well done - check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the risk parameters section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are the collateral listing decisions made?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What risk framework is used for collateral?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the money market adapting to the changing circumstances of the tokens it lists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iie-safety-module&#34;&gt;II.E/ Safety Module
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the risk is known at every level, &lt;strong&gt;insurance is never an option and never supernumerary&lt;/strong&gt;. The first layer of defense is of course the platform-level if there is any compensation module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there is! Aave pioneered the field &amp;amp; even Compound has a reserve now. The second good news is that assessing the usefulness of this module is dead simple: it&amp;rsquo;s a simple ratio between the total $ value of the borrows made on the money market and the total $ that can be mobilized by the safety module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aave has roughly 2B in the Safety Module, of which up to 30% can be seized if needed = 600M. It covers both the V1 &amp;amp; V2 of the protocol. If the 30% on the slashing of the Safety Module is not sufficient, the safety module can mint additional AAVE tokens. Such a scenario is accounted for by neither Compound nor Cream.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of insurance, money markets can also have reserves. Compound is the pioneer here, with about $10M in reseve&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Aave also has a reserve system that was recently launched, but I excluded it from the analysis considering the limited balance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking at the available numbers, here are our quick maths:
&lt;code&gt;Safety Ratio = USD value of insurance / Total borrow on the money market&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛡 Aave =  53%&lt;/strong&gt; | $1.765 B (600M can be mobilized) in the Safety Module for $1.1B borrowed accross V1+V2 ($572M V1, $437M V2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🕯 Compound = 0.24%&lt;/strong&gt; | $4.3B borrowed on a $10M safety capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💀 Cream = 0%&lt;/strong&gt; | As far as I know, Cream has no or highly limited (low amounts) native insurance module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ℹ Note: While Compound currently has no safety module, the team/DAO is currently sitting on a large COMP reserve that could be used to that end&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The maths were done on Feb 17 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;evaluating-the-native-insurance-module&#34;&gt;Evaluating the native insurance module
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-null, but not as relevant here. The SM is here to provide compensations in case of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Depositors know they can get slashed if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Aave&amp;rsquo;s pioneering the field. The slashing launched weeks ago. So far no events required Aave to harness the safety module, but it&amp;rsquo;s great to know it&amp;rsquo;s here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how protecting the native safety and insurance modules are, here are some decent questions to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any native insurance module covering the platform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the withdrawal delays &amp;amp; safeguards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the coverage ratio (USD TVL exposed / USD TVL of Safety Module)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iif-expanded-insurance-ecosystem&#34;&gt;II.F/ Expanded Insurance Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the native insurance system of the money market, depositors and borrowers can &lt;strong&gt;cover their positions through a third party insurance service&lt;/strong&gt; like Nexus Mutual or Unslashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;most widely covered risk is the one of a technical failure of smart contracts&lt;/span&gt;. You will find covers for pretty much any widely used contract there is. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;smart contract failures are not the only event that can lead to a loss of funds on a money market&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Robert Leshner the CEO of Compound can factually state the following&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while the protocol recently suffered 90M of abusive liquidations because of faulty oracles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compound has been operating for close to 2 years with ZERO smart contract bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It creates a false sense of security many are falling for, just like the period of operation of the protocol. Notice how I left it out of these 8 criteria? It&amp;rsquo;s because it has close to zero relevance despite services like DeFiScore giving it an absurdly important weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m careful when I talk about &amp;ldquo;90M of abusive liquidations because of faulty oracles&amp;rdquo; but to be explicit - it affected negatively potentially any DAI borrower back then that might have gotten liquidated wrongly - losing a part of their deposit with &lt;strong&gt;no recourse and no compensation&lt;/strong&gt; since Compound operated as intended (smart-contract wise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of risks of smart contract failures, please consider the following list of non-exhaustive other risks that can result in a loss of fund:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure or manipulation of an oracle,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issue with the smart contract of a token used collateral (such as infinite mint),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stablecoin used as collateral or borrowing asset on the market lose its peg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device or wallet of the admin of a not-so-decentralized service is compromised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues or delays with liquidations, meaning the money market can potentially no longer meet its collateralization requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most insurance services are unhelpful with all these risks but for the risks of smart contract failures. The market for other types of risk is barely getting started thanks to Unslashed Finance now providing &lt;strong&gt;coverage for the risk of stablecoins losing their peg&lt;/strong&gt; or custodian risk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;this piece from DeFi Rate&lt;/a&gt;. However please keep in mind the &lt;strong&gt;massive bias here&lt;/strong&gt;: it was written more than two years ago by Hugh Karp, founder of Nexus Mutual. However, it&amp;rsquo;s still factual enough and insightful to understand the different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;understanding-insurances-and-the-risk-they-truly-cover&#34;&gt;Understanding insurances and the risk they truly cover
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯Object&lt;/strong&gt;: Smart Contract Failure + stablecoin loss of peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💰Utility&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides compensation if a failure is observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt;: Nexus Mutual, one of the oldest insurance options already paid out on several situations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the topic of extended insurances, you will want to look at services such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unslashed.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Unslashed Finance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nexusmutual.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Cover Protocol&lt;/a&gt; and the plans they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the options available through the ecosystem to cover a position on the money market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are their pricing and reliability (paid out already?)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iig-native-token-risk-management&#34;&gt;II.G/ Native Token Risk Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discussed quite a bit about the various tokens used as collateral, but there is one you need to watch extra carefully: the &lt;strong&gt;native token of the money market&lt;/strong&gt;. So that&amp;rsquo;s the COMP token on Compound, AAVE on Aave, and CREAM on Cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum Loan to Value (max LTV) dictates the borrowing power of collaterals. A 50% max LTV means one can borrow up to half to the dollar value of the collateral deposited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first layer is of course to make sure that there is no fool play: &lt;strong&gt;the money market must be neutral and not favor its own token&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems obvious, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a given. Cream allows an excessive 75% max LTV on CREAM, one of the highest of the whole protocol - as high as some stablecoins. Compound itself gives COMP a permissive 60% max LTV while Aave is more conservative at 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the money market is healthy and the token well designed - people should be bullish on it, meaning some of them use it as collateral to long it - aka depositing AAVE on Aave to long AAVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, despite the permissive LTV, COMP&amp;rsquo;s and CREAM&amp;rsquo;s longs are rarer than AAVE&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-how-a-money-market-manage-its-native-token-risks&#34;&gt;Assessing how a money market manage its native token risks
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s an all or nothing event: the money market can play with fire on its native token for months with no consequences before the situation eventually blow up and the token + the money market crumble together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: The loss can potentially be system-wide (whole money market affected).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❌Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Not yet. But Cream is already way beyond any reasonable max LTV figure on the CREAM token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some considerations worth exploring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the health of the native token of the platform: token contract, liquidity, integrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the native token usage on the protocol &amp;amp; assess the health of its market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership, distribution, and Gini coefficient of the governance token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on the money market themselves. Yet, they are community-driven &amp;amp; governed projects, so their community &amp;amp; integration within the ecosystem are an essential part of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iih-community--ecosystem&#34;&gt;II.H/ Community &amp;amp; Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, communities are essential. It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;nice-to-have&amp;rdquo; to make the protocol more attractive, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;core feature&lt;/strong&gt; and I assess it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On such a topic, again, no metrics will help you just by themselves. The gist is to get a sense of how dynamic the community is. It usually translates into its core components: the DAO, the Discord, and the overall presence in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of a healthy community is &lt;strong&gt;widespread support and usage across the ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;, with many services and products built &amp;ldquo;on top of&amp;rdquo; the protocol examined. Here despite Compound&amp;rsquo;s lead being the first mover, Aave is also now a prime choice for any new protocol building a new financial primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, teams can purposely foster such an environment simply by having members accessible and involved in the space. Besides, Aave has an &lt;strong&gt;ecosystem grants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; initiative helping to fund projects built on top of Aave such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/firp-apwine.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine offering fixed yields&lt;/a&gt;. Other community-related initiatives are a healthy tell, such as hackathons, AMAs, livestreams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again here - make sure to &lt;strong&gt;assess the quality, not the quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to rush out all the initiatives listed above. But doing it right, in a way that makes sense for the community and pushes it forward is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this a case against Compound, but here again, it&amp;rsquo;s so obvious. While Compound community fundings are quite limited the grants program just launched&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, its founder Robert Leshner is an active venture capital investor, with the Robot Ventures funds&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-the-community--dao-of-a-money-market&#34;&gt;Assessing the community &amp;amp; DAO of a money market
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: The community is the most important feature of all for the long-term success of the money market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term risk. If a money market loses the community favors, it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be a dramatic event but more of slow and painful threading into irrelevance for the given market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, with Compound - they lost their top of mind position and preference for several reasons, such as their lack of support for the ecosystem, the DAI Market Oracle issue &amp;amp; the team reaction to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some questions and clues to help you assess this last yet essential part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the DAO-level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it work to submit a proposal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are they reviewed and improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the delay between the vote and the execution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any proposal that was ignored or not implemented for a long time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core team members:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they legit? Involved in the space? Giving back? Advising?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background-check: any involvement with a scam? What were they doing before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present-check: on top of their involvement with the money market, what are they doing? Any potential conflict of interest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation &amp;amp; support: how hard is it to build on top of this money market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the services built on top of the money market? Are they widely used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they communicating clearly on risk parameters? Do they have non-technical/non-dev risk-focused documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-a-note-on-defi-tribalism&#34;&gt;III/ A note on DeFi Tribalism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring such a topic was insanely insightful for me, at so many levels. I remain quite surprised by the tribalism of the space: apart from Aave, gathering the information presented in this article was not a trivial task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the question I asked and the observations I shared, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the target of personal attacks from founders of some of the teams mentioned in this article. Others were quite misleading and selective in their answers. I received no answers from both Cream &amp;amp; Compound official accounts or teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such attitudes gave me even more will to push this article forward. &lt;strong&gt;Beyond the technicalities of each protocol, I think the attitude of the founding team is essential too&lt;/strong&gt;. On this front, there is a protocol that stands an order of magnitude above any other: surprise surprise, it also happens to be the most technically sound, secure, integrated, and exciting, and interesting. 👻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iiia-limitations-of-this-risk-assessment-approach&#34;&gt;III.A/ Limitations of this risk assessment approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I anticipate strong reactions already, so let me add a few more topics not addressed here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we went quite deep, we did not discuss the tokenization process: the process used by the protocol to represent the assets deposited. On this front, &lt;strong&gt;both Compound and Cream are using an archaic approach&lt;/strong&gt; that was topped on all fronts by Aave with the first release of the aTokens in early 2020.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Aave V2 further improved the tokenization process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream by itself is a small market, but &lt;strong&gt;through the Iron Bank other protocols can borrow from Cream&lt;/strong&gt;. Assessing the risk on such a market is even harder - and it was excluded from this analysis. To learn more about the real risk already posed and manifested by such an approach, you can check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.rekt.news/alpha-finance-rekt/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;latest Rekt on Alpha Homora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While MakerDAO provides a service functionally equivalent to lending, the process is significantly different since each borrower is minting DAI. So for the sake of simplicity, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly excluded MakerDAO from this analysis, but for a few meaningful examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Aave, Compound, Cream, or any other money market. However, I do own AAVE tokens (that I purchased myself on the markets) and stake them in the Safety Module. All the content hosted on my blog is made accessible for free - I am the sole editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better grasp of the scope of risks in money markets. I want to stress again that it&amp;rsquo;s non-exhaustive, nor absolute truth but I do firmly believe provides clear and useful contributions to make sure risks in DeFi are broadly understood, better than what currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not agree with this statement, feel free to challenge me. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m eager for facts disproving my observations: it would mean DeFi is safer than I thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are around $450K worth of tokens collected in the reserve as of now: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#reserve-factor&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Compound is also sitting on a 4 million COMP (roughly $1.8b) chest that could be allocated for insurance &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1358569634618867714?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes he&amp;rsquo;s factual since the contract never failed so far. However for less technically-savy people, it can read like Compound never suffered any loss, which is not the case. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1358566161361821696?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;RoboVC&lt;/a&gt;: It funded several services harnessing Compound (like InstaDapp or Multis) &amp;amp; Compound itself.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:18&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for aTokens&amp;rsquo; technical superiority could be the topic on an article by itself but here is the gist of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simpler&lt;/strong&gt;: aTokens maintain a 1:1 ratio against the base asset while cTokens have an increasing exchange rate against their base assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier accounting &amp;amp; integrations&lt;/strong&gt;: aTokens 1:1 correspondence makes them much easier to interact with - there is no need to fetch any additional data. With Compound, any service interacting with cTokens needs to fetch the corresponding the cToken/BaseToken exchange rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic and understandable interest&lt;/strong&gt;: both a &amp;amp; c tokens accrue interest dynamically. However, here again, because of aTokens&amp;rsquo; more elegant and straightforward design, the experience is more fluid with aTokens (deposit, reassured by 1:1 correspondence, number go up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More potent integrations&lt;/strong&gt;: aToken allows for novel use cases, especially if you take into account the other features of Aave. For instance, there is a Yearn vault harnessing aLINK to borrow USDC from users&amp;rsquo; deposits to farm with them and settle the income for more aLINK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/firp-apwine/pac-man.png" alt="Featured image of post 🍷 Yields are like fine wines, the secret lies in the brewing process" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields are like fine wines, the secret lies in the brewing process. As DeFi is developing faster than ever, with now more than $ 50 billion of total value locked across all protocols, &lt;strong&gt;the yield offering is diversifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our topic today strikes at the heart of this trend, with a solution offering a potentially instant payout for deposits on DeFi protocols like Yearn or Aave: APWine. Before we get to this point however, we need to place back some context on money markets and FIRPs in general since they are still novel types of products for most DeFi users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;money-market--pacman&#34;&gt;Money Market = PacMan

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tranching, insurance, and FIRPs are essentially like &lt;strong&gt;abstraction-layers built on top of a money market&lt;/strong&gt; to provide additional features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔪 Tranching&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ better separation of the different type of risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛡 Insurance&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ coverage against technical failures (&amp;amp; more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 FIRPs&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ &amp;ldquo;coverage&amp;rdquo; against variations of APY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they are interesting as a features by themselves, what fascinates me is what happens &lt;strong&gt;when/if they are integrated at the base level&lt;/strong&gt;. It would enable other protocols to harness these features. For instance, Harvest could offer a &amp;ldquo;de-risked&amp;rdquo; USDC vault &amp;amp; essentially bringing the whole DeFi to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeFi&amp;rsquo;s different value set is not only a benefit for transparency and audibility: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;also at least &lt;ins&gt;an order of magnitude&lt;/ins&gt; more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; than the dying patchwork of finance it&amp;rsquo;s bound to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-interest-rate-protocols-firps&#34;&gt;Fixed Interest Rate Protocols (FIRPs)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s define what Fixed Interest Rate Protocols are and what are their role within the broader ecosystem of decentralized finance on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With DeFi, the goal for most is &lt;strong&gt;to produce yields from a given asset.&lt;/strong&gt; Usually one of the easiest ways to achieve this will be to lend it for instance, for a return. Doing so means assuming several layers of risk you can insure yourself against (-&amp;gt; Unslashed) or simply avoid taking with tranching (-&amp;gt; Saffron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re super responsible and try to insure &amp;amp; further protect your deposits, you are left with one sizable issue: &lt;strong&gt;the base return produced by the asset is usually volatile&lt;/strong&gt;, making the pricing of the whole package (lended deposit + insurance + tranching) hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;full report here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely where FIRPs get a chance to shine: &lt;strong&gt;since they make the interest predictable, FIRPs help promote a more responsible attitude&lt;/strong&gt; for the whole space - by making it easier to use all the meta-structure now available to protect deposits on money markets or DeFi asset managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article addresses fixed interest rate protocols only. For a broader perspective on risk management for DeFi deposits, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read my introduction piece touching on insurance, tranching and FIRPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In there, we addressed how insurance, tranching, and fixed interest might eventually be integrated natively into money-markets, enabling to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;envision &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; interest bearing stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, this article assume a minimal understanding of the topic. If something is still unclear, please refer to the previous article ☝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apwine-fixed-yield-sauternes-&#34;&gt;APWine: Fixed-yield Sauternes 🍷
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with the hell of an intro and without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into today&amp;rsquo;s matter: &lt;strong&gt;understanding what FIRPs are and what they bring to the table through the lense of APWine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍷 Even better, it&amp;rsquo;s wine-themed and Frenchies are involved - what&amp;rsquo;s not to love already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-difference-between-apwine-and-88mph&#34;&gt;The difference between APWine and 88MPH
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a high-level perspective, both projects could be described as FIRPs, yet they achieve this result through different means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With 88MPH, the yield of your deposits are fixed thanks to a secondary prediction market built for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With APWine, you can lock your assets for a month for instance to instantly earn the yield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to be more explicit, both are not interchangeable nor operating on the same time frame: with 88MPH, the income becomes &lt;strong&gt;predictable but it&amp;rsquo;s still an iterative process&lt;/strong&gt;. With APWine, the income becomes &lt;strong&gt;predictable &amp;amp; instantly delivered&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means different tradeoffs on the risk management side. With 88MPH, the yield is calculated algorithmically - there&amp;rsquo;s always a buyer, which is neat for convenience, but also means the protocol can accrue debt if there is a mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite is true for APWine: since it&amp;rsquo;s market-based, no mismatch can occur (-&amp;gt; no protocol debt), but it means there can be demand/offer issues (such as heavy discount on FYTs).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apwine-instant-payday&#34;&gt;APWine: Instant Payday?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With APWine, the logic is quite straightforward. It all starts by depositing a token earning some yield, such as a stablecoin deposited on Aave or a Yearn vault token onto the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of each period, users receive FYT (Future Yield Tokens) representing their yields for the period. &lt;strong&gt;The FYT are standard ERC-20 tokens&lt;/strong&gt; that will be tradable shortly after launch on APWine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit is locked for the period, however users can withdraw early with a fee, by burning their FYT tokens. The slashing is deactivated for the beta period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the yield is instantly available and usable, APWine should provide ample opportunities for both hedging and arbitraging.&lt;/p&gt;

The beta will start in a couple of weeks with a first period starting on March 1st for 30 days. The APW token and liquidity mining should could shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.medium.com/our-beta-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-3860491a365c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More information on APWine beta &amp;amp; launch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-apwine&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next for APWine?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, I&amp;rsquo;ll be following closely the upcoming launch of the platform next week. Several upcoming releases have already been announced such as the arrival of more services and pools on the platform and the release of the APW token and its associated liquidity mining plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like always though, what gets me really excited is the endgame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-endgame-a-yield-hedging-protocol&#34;&gt;The Endgame: a yield hedging protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we envision the end-game here, first we need to see if the idea works and &lt;strong&gt;if there is a real fit.&lt;/strong&gt; In the APWine case, &lt;strong&gt;success will be measured by looking at the health of the markets for FYT tokens&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect them to settle at parity with expected yields, but if users can really get an &lt;strong&gt;instant payday even with a 20% fee&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving this means having really liquid FYT markets, which is perfectly doable especially if there is a liquidity mining plan in APW token to bootstrap them. Regarding the APW token itself, diving in the FAQ will give you a bit more insight into what the team envisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each future expiration, 10% of the generated yield is shared between all APW token holders (percentage subject to change in the future based on the market demand). The token will also enable them to participate in the governance mechanisms of APWine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/faq&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ApWine FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on top of the usual governance right of the protocol, it seems like there is already a revenue stream considered for the APW token, on top of any potential liquidity mining plan involving an APW-based pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French being the language of DeFi, it was about time we got some fine wine-makers involved in the yield brewing process! If you are interested in the protocol, you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.medium.com/our-beta-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-3860491a365c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read more about the beta here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be following closely as I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0B64swtPI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a chat with Antoine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the persons involved with APWine next week (in French).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BadgerDAO&#39;s story: an intro through DIGG</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/badger-digg/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/badger-digg/cover.png/" alt="Featured image of post BadgerDAO&#39;s story: an intro through DIGG" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite launching barely a few weeks ago, BadgerDAO quickly grew into a DeFi powerhouse now &lt;strong&gt;hosting &amp;gt; $1.2B of assets farming&lt;/strong&gt;. While I&amp;rsquo;ve quickly touched on Badger in previous articles or shows, I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time for a dedicated piece focusing on DIGG but not forgetting about its context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-intro-to-badger-dao&#34;&gt;A quick intro to Badger DAO
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BadgetDAO is a community-driven project with a clear value proposition: to help &lt;strong&gt;build the infrastructure needed to relay BTC into DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;. This core vision manifests through all their products, all centered around representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum like wBTC or sBTC and the native tokens - BADGER and now DIGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clear-value-proposition-btc-on-ethereum-optimizer&#34;&gt;Clear value proposition: BTC on Ethereum optimizer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first layer of this onion is pretty straightforward: Badger offers a Yearn-like service for BTCs on Ethereum: users can deposit tokens representing a position in a Curve BTC pool to earn BADGER &amp;amp; DIGG on top of the native APY.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also vaults (called &amp;ldquo;setts&amp;rdquo;) available for BADGER and DIGG themselves, as well as their respective LP tokens on both Uniswap and SushiSwap.&lt;/p&gt;

As the vault accrues additional tokens through its harvests, the vault token increasingly represents more and more of the underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value proposition by itself is nothing new and could have been delivered by Yearn directly. What makes Badger special is &lt;strong&gt;how the team approaches building the product and the whole underlying vision behind it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;community-focus&#34;&gt;Community-focus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start, the community has been put at the center with Badger. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly visible simply by looking at the token distributions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the two largest shares of the supply of both tokens were allocated to the liquidity mining program - rewarding active users of the protocol as well as the DAO&amp;rsquo;s treasury tasked with structuring the long-term operations of the protocol and its growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airdrops, along with the vaults created a very attractive loop for the receivers: unlike the UNI airdrop where most people choice was to sell or hold, with BADGER &amp;amp; DIGG, people &lt;strong&gt;optimistic about the protocol from the get-go had the chance to compound their airdrop with the vaults&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial BADGER airdrop recognized key actions tied to Bitcoin on Ethereum, as well as gitcoin donors. The second airdrop (DIGG) rewarded interactions with the Badger ecosystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the momentum created by the launch and initial distribution, the community was able to sustain it thanks to a blossoming spirit of meming: a distribution of NFT was organized on Meme&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, available to the depositors in the bBADGER sett or wBTC/BADGER Uniswap sett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 6 different NFTs were available and the fist one to collect them was able to claim a neat BADGER bounty. Being a holder or farmer of these NFTs was acknowledged in the initial DIGG distribution &amp;amp; their inclusion to Badger as yield multiplier is being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;

You&amp;rsquo;ll be much better off simply holding your stack and selling it. If you are worried about this scenario unfolding with Badger or DIGG, you can deposit to the BADGER or DIGG only vaults (no risk of impermanent loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-you-digging-it-yet&#34;&gt;Are you DIGGing it yet?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG is the second major step of Badger&amp;rsquo;s DAO project: a new type of representation of BTC living on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike wBTC or renBTC, DIGG is not backed by a fixed supply of BTCs. Instead, it uses the rebase mechanism initiated by Ampleforth to attempt to eventually deliver an asset keeping track of BTC&amp;rsquo;s price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how DIGG works, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly discuss the pre and post-launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wen-digg&#34;&gt;Wen DIGG?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG&amp;rsquo;s launch was a highly anticipated event. While from the outside it looks like it took longer than what was expected, what happened internally was fascinating: the &lt;strong&gt;initial community gathered around Badger was actively involved in the key decisions surrounding DIGG.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussion within the community, it was decided to go with a relatively low starting supply (4000) allowing for a &lt;strong&gt;stress test from the start of the rebase mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The rebases also started from the very beginning - 24h after the launch of the token.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badger being Badger, the hype machine was of course on point with a &amp;ldquo;Wen DIGG?&amp;rdquo; meme contest to make sure everyone was aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the meat of it: the rebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rebases&#34;&gt;Rebases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG is what is called an &amp;ldquo;elastic currency&amp;rdquo;, as initiated by Ampleforth. What it means is that the total supply of DIGG is not set, but fluctuates daily based on the time-weighted average price of DIGG against its peg - BTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more DIGG is &amp;ldquo;off from his peg&amp;rdquo;, meaning its price is superior to the price of BTC, the more the DIGG supply is diluted, with the additional DIGG produced distributed proportionately to all the holders. The mechanism works exactly the same the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with AMPL, with DIGG all holders (liquidity pool tokens included) are impacted by the rebase, be it positive or negative. However with DIGG, just like with the seigniorage tokens, there is a mechanism to abstract it to allow for a better composability within DeFi: that&amp;rsquo;s bDIGG, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss it right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebases happen at a set time, for DIGG it&amp;rsquo;s 3pm EST, that&amp;rsquo;s 9 pm for my dear French readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebase tokens harness mechanisms similar to the ones involved in algorithmic stablecoins / seigniorage tokens, so feel free to read my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous post on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, after the first day, the genesis rebase was positive and triggered a production and redistribution of about 12% of the initial supply. Several positive rebases followed and DIGG is still trading above peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the rebase mechanism is quite straightforward but it might be better aligned with the setts incentives in the future to help DIGG maintain its peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-step-for-the-setts&#34;&gt;Next step for the setts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With DIGG launched, the next big step for Badger as the protocol is to start increasing its capital efficiency: to put it in simple words - to allow its users to borrow from their setts positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it clearer (while extrapolating quite a bit): picture the current Badger, with an additional function allowing you to mint DAI from your setts like you do with your vaults on Maker. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, setts would make for quite desirable collateral, considering they accrue in value against the base asset. So BTC setts for instance could be potentially as safe as their underlying assets, accounting for the additional layers of risks involved by the fact that the underlying asset is a Curve LP token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before we see a native lending market on Badger, I expect to see different &lt;strong&gt;Badger-related tokens and setts accepted as collateral&lt;/strong&gt; on other lending platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this front, I&amp;rsquo;d like to draw your attention to bDIGG in particular. While it represents a position made a 100% of DIGG which rebases, &lt;strong&gt;bDIGG itself does not rebase&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s like a layer of abstraction built on top of DIGG, a rebase-buffer amongst other things. It makes it easier to integrate it into other protocols, and I expect to eventually see a wide range of support for bDIGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-endgame-for-badgerdao--defi-in-general&#34;&gt;The endgame for BadgerDAO &amp;amp; DeFi in general
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endgame for Badger would be like what I described before along with a full ecosystem around the CLAW or whatever his name is.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It would increasingly turn Badger into a more of a Synthetix-like service where holders are given different options of more or less active involvement in the ecosystem, with the appropriate rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As services like Badger integrate money-market components such as borrowing, they &lt;strong&gt;increase the capital efficiency for their users&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to be a representation of BTC producing 20% APY is now the same + you can borrow a share of its value in stablecoin to further increase the yield, if that suits your risk appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic is bigger than Badger, as it&amp;rsquo;s observed elsewhere too, we could call it the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;platformization of Defi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Yearn is implementing a similar approach with the Iron Bank where some services will be able to borrow under-collateralized, generating a capital-efficiency moat for the eligible lucky ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to go back to Badger, moving towards a model like this could mean native &amp;amp; sustained revenue feeds to potentially tie back to Badger. Considering that most of the yields currently come from liquidity mining incentives, that would be quite synergistic to grow out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/dex-value-capture.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;success of the Curve &amp;amp; CRV model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it makes sense to see more and more protocol adopting elements of it: the gist being giving your holders the options to commit their tokens to participate in governance, tap into the platform revenue streams &amp;amp; boost their own returns obtained by the usage of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Volume begets fees: how are the main decentralized exchanges capturing value?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/decentralized-exchange-value-capture/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Volume begets fees: how are the main decentralized exchanges capturing value?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve shared my perspective on many DeFi protocols on this blog, but recently I realized I&amp;rsquo;ve never gone back to the basics: the DEXs. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely what we will do today, tackling the topic mostly by looking at value capture mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMM-based DEXs like Uniswap, Curve or SushiSwap all grew tremendously both in available liquidity and volume this year, and so did the fees they collected. To put it simply: &lt;strong&gt;these DEXs now are the main fee-collectors there are in crypto, right after the Bitcoin and Ethereum network themselves&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite an impressive achievement! So today we&amp;rsquo;ll look at this yummy cake and understand how it&amp;rsquo;s split. What&amp;rsquo;s the different approaches? What is their token used for / how do they establish their incentive model? And then how will the arrival of layer 2 impact all of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rise-of-automated-market-maker-amms&#34;&gt;The rise of Automated Market Maker (AMMs)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the discussions around automated market makers (AMMs) lately, I wanted, as usual, to take a step back and consider the current state of the market, the position of the main players and what&amp;rsquo;s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss AMMs but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the technical details of the bonding curves to others. Instead, we will address the topic from a value capture and tokenomics perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise and development of AMMs fundamentally changed the market&lt;/strong&gt;. Before their dominion, order-book based approaches were still widely used. One of the main merits of AMMs is to change the logic of the service, as it becomes &lt;strong&gt;peer to contract&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need for a matching order on the other side, thanks to the bonding curve, there&amp;rsquo;s always one (within pool liquidity &amp;amp; slippage limits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the key factors that enabled them to grow as they streamlined everything related to token exchanges: from the act of swapping itself, but also liquidity providing and even things like fetching a price for assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have our beautiful DEX-commissions-cake, now let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the main services&amp;rsquo; value capture mechanism to better understand their main differences.&lt;/p&gt;

It might be a good follow-up piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-capture-mechanisms-in-discovery-mode&#34;&gt;Value capture mechanisms in discovery mode
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the different iterations and releases of the main DEXs, their value capture mechanisms evolved. Initially, there was not necessarily a token and a share of the exchange collected fee captured by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uniswap-the-need-for-liquidity&#34;&gt;Uniswap: The need for liquidity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in the first days of the AMM, the main concern was liquidity - still very scarce back then: Uniswap had no token and no need for it to pioneer the AMM-front. The initial and still current fee distribution infrastructure matches this requirement: a &lt;strong&gt;30 bps fee (0.3%) is taken on every trade and distributed to the liquidity providers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a perfect fit to start as you have a liquidity chicken and egg problem to begin with: sufficient liquidity will enable swaps without too much slippage, driving volume (if there&amp;rsquo;s need for the given token/market) and therefore revenues for LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no fee or value capture at the token-level but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;ready to be implemented&lt;/strong&gt; if the DAO was to decide it - the V2 of the protocol shipped last year includes a &lt;code&gt;Protocol fee&lt;/code&gt; feature.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sushiswap-value-capture-to-the-token&#34;&gt;SushiSwap: Value capture to the token
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early days, one of the core changes of SushiSwap was a slight reduction of this fee to 25 bps to &lt;strong&gt;redirect the 5 bps left to SUSHI stakers.&lt;/strong&gt; This enables SUSHI stakers to get a share of the fees collected on all pairs, instead of liquidity-pair based distribution only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the initial distribution phase, there were several adjustments made but the mechanism is roughly the same. Onsen introduced a rotational reward system onboard relevant new pools. More importantly for the tokenomics, ⅔ of the SUSHI rewards earned through liquidity mining are now vested over a 6 months period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/sushi-onsen.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sushiswap-onsen&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vesting reduces the incentives for &amp;ldquo;mercenary liquidity&amp;rdquo;, especially for liquidity managed by a vault for instance &amp;amp; helps to &lt;strong&gt;make sure that large liquidity providers are also SUSHI holders at all time&lt;/strong&gt; (even up to 6 months after they&amp;rsquo;re done farming), better aligning interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this split, SushiSwap distributes a 0.25% fee for each swap to LP, just like Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s 0.30%. On top of this fee, another 0.05% fee is collected on each swap in form of LP tokens, and settled for SUSHI distributed to the stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements brought by Sushi are relevant, yet in my eyes the real game-changer is the Curve model, so let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-peek-at-the-endgame-curve-finance--crv&#34;&gt;A peek at the endgame? Curve Finance &amp;amp; CRV
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve&amp;rsquo;s model is slightly more complex than the previous but results in an ever better alignment of incentives between the platform users and the token holders. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of the CRV token, liquidity providers on Curve have been earning CRV tokens on top of their usual commissions (if they stake). And just like SushiSwap, Curve&amp;rsquo;s introduced a form of value capture at the CRV-token level.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the model is more intricate so let&amp;rsquo;s discuss each part and see how they interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-tutorial--the-timelock&#34;&gt;1/ Tutorial : The Timelock
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make use of CRV tokens within Curve, the first choice one has to make is the length of its commitment. The base unit is veCRV, a time-weighted locked CRV enabled for governance. To be explicit: &lt;strong&gt;to be eligible for the fees collected and other features discussed below, you need to lock your CRV token for at least 1 year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism is quite straightforward, you can lock for 1 to 4 years. 4 years will give you 1 veCRV per CRV, decreasing linearly to 0.25 veCRV per CRV for a one year period. As said before, veCRV is the base unit of the system - so it will determine how much fees as well as boosting and governance power you have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-level-up-zone--your-share-of-the-fees&#34;&gt;2/ Level-up Zone : Your share of the fees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staking and locking CRV tokens in the DAO is enough to be eligible for a share of the fees collected on Curve, yet it&amp;rsquo;s only the first step of the journey. The commissions are collected frequently and settled for 3pool LP tokens. The mechanism recently kicked off and started distributing rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the effective return fluctuates as it&amp;rsquo;s tied to Curve&amp;rsquo;s exchange volume and the CRV token acquisition price. At the time of writing, it&amp;rsquo;s around &lt;strong&gt;$0.29 yearly for 1 vecRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To describe the next layer of the Curve&amp;rsquo;s onion, I love to use a metaphor inspired from online role-playing games. Indeed, there are three types of realms fitting to describe the next three steps for Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvE (Player vs Environment)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you face only AI-controlled monsters (mobs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvP (vs Players)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you fight against other players in a set environment (arena/battlefield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RvR (Realm vs Realm)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you fight against other players potentially everywhere (faction-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll use this frame of reference to analyze the next three layers of the Curve&amp;rsquo;s onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-curves-pve---boosting-crv-rewards&#34;&gt;3/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvE - Boosting CRV rewards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to earn CRV on top of their usual commissions. But they can also &lt;strong&gt;use their veCRV tokens to boost&lt;/strong&gt; one or several of their pools, increasing the CRV earned up to 2.5 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, one needs an amount of veCRV proportionate to the $value of the liquidity providing position boosted. The effective cost (in veCRV) to have the maximum boost is not the same for each pool - creating a first layer of incentives/arbitrages games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/crv-boost.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Curve CRV boosting&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mechanism enabling a better alignment of incentive: &lt;strong&gt;large and efficient CRV earners are also significant veCRV holders&lt;/strong&gt; (-&amp;gt; locked for 1-4 years) so they have a fair amount of skin in the game. Yet it&amp;rsquo;s just the first &amp;amp; friendliest layer of Curve&amp;rsquo;s meta game. Let&amp;rsquo;s go deeper into the onion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-curves-pvp---the-gauge-weights-game&#34;&gt;4/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvP - The Gauge Weight&amp;rsquo;s Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pool-boosting is PvE, the gauge-weights are Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvP arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge-weights are a bit similar to boosting, but &lt;strong&gt;at the platform-level&lt;/strong&gt;. veCRV holders can vote to &lt;strong&gt;decide the share of newly minted CRV allocated to each pool&lt;/strong&gt;. Additional restrictions apply here to prevent the manipulation of the votes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VeCRV needs to be locked with at least 7 days left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gauge weight voting can only be changed by users every 10 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables the incentivization of new pools, theoretically without impulse needed from the Curve team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-curves-rvr---governance--inter-protocol-gov&#34;&gt;5/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s RvR - Governance &amp;amp; inter-protocol gov
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last layer of the onion lies with Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance: veCRV holders can vote on the DAO proposal and with at least 2 500 veCRV, you can submit a proposal to the DAO. So, to recap, once you hold veCRV, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a share of the fees collected by the exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can boost your own CRV streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through gauges, influence future CRV emission on curve pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally with the governance, you have a say in the key parameters of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 1&amp;amp;2 is what is of interest to most-end users, &lt;strong&gt;items 3&amp;amp;4 can be incredibly valuable for other dApps, DeFi projects and protocol politicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the possibilities are virtually endless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance, imagine a project introducing a new stablecoin. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be neat for them to have governance power within Curve to eventually include it in a boosted Curve pool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even deeper into the onion, already &lt;strong&gt;successful DeFi projects with treasury can allocate a part of it to the CRV token to harness the benefits from all 4 items&lt;/strong&gt; - 1&amp;amp;2 to boost their treasury income streams and 3&amp;amp;4 to make their platform or service more attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another layer deeper: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://crv.ape.tax&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s yveCRV vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It offers better returns on CRV than staking yourself (~1.3x), but depositors renounce boosting and voting capacity in favor of Yearn - which can then use this extra boosting/voting capacity to enhance the yield of its vaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final level of depth: imagine a crypto/DeFi PR-like service a couple years from now. I expect them to be able to &lt;strong&gt;supply other projects with proposition power&lt;/strong&gt; on the main DAOs like Curve or Aave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-next-steps-for-curve&#34;&gt;6/ Next Steps for Curve
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have to consider one last dimension on Curve, as it&amp;rsquo;s not just any DEX. Indeed, from the get-go Curve specialized into the &lt;strong&gt;swaps of pegged-assets&lt;/strong&gt; and optimized for it. It started with stablecoins only, but we now also have BTC and ETH representations too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the growing available liquidity, the team is now harnessing DeFi synergies (with Synthetix) to offer swaps between the different pegged assets listed on Curve, such as DAI -&amp;gt; wBTC or USDT -&amp;gt; EURS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides incredible value as it covers markets that are currently not broadly available elsewhere (EURS) and enables a minimization of slippage for large trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay concise, Uniswap and Sushiswap&amp;rsquo;s bonding curves are well suited to &lt;strong&gt;support many small or average swaps, especially on large pools&lt;/strong&gt; with a low slippage. However, they are less optimal for large orders as slippage increases in proportion to the share of liquidity of the pool required by the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; helps you streamline this process &amp;amp; optimize your swap further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-outlook-l2--its-incentives&#34;&gt;Future outlook: L2 &amp;amp; its incentives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this article, let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about the upcoming tectonic shift for the Ethereum space: the increasing availability of layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we saw the value transacted on AMM explode to the detriment of order-book based approaches. They streamlined the whole experience and made tons of sense for layer 1 so we can reasonably expect them to pave the way for L2 decentralized trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loopring is already delivering live in production an AMM on L2:&lt;/strong&gt; a zk-Sync based L2 DEX with various incentives for liquidity providers. Curve has been working with Zk-Sync too, so we can reasonnably expect them to ship a live L2 product this year considering the latest developments with Zk-Sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Synthetix recently rolled their Optimism L2 mainnet and the force seems strong around a Uniswap x Optimism rollout. Jokingly the other day I was saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetix Optimism L2 is Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s testnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising to see Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s L2 implementation rolling out within weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, what about tokoenomics x L2? I expect to see &lt;strong&gt;LP incentives too migrating to L2&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s already the case with Loopring. Synthetic too quickstarted its current limited L2 (minting/burning only) with SNX incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services that do not already have a token might have an edge here as they can incentive the L2 directly. On the other hand, the protocols that heavily incentivized their L1 already might lack firepower to match the incentives offered by projects with &amp;ldquo;L2-native&amp;rdquo; tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be fascinating to watch the releases of the different layer 2 and how they impact the protocols usage and tokenomics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-tale-of-two-seigniorage-models-basis-vs-esd/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚖ The tale of two seigniorage models: Basis vs ESD" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I shared my first post on algorithmic stablecoins highlighting the key characteristics that made such projects interesting in my eyes. In this piece, we&amp;rsquo;ll go deeper into the topics, with a &lt;strong&gt;comparative analysis of the two main models&lt;/strong&gt;: the Basis model and the ESD model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are successfully used by the projects bearing their names but also a sizable trail of forks, more or less relevant. As the field of algorithmic stablecoin grows, there seems to be a &lt;strong&gt;consensus around these two models, now used as a template&lt;/strong&gt; to quickstart newer projects trying various alterations, such as pegging the system to another currency other than the dollar, like gold or the euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plethora of existing forks enables the latest ones to pick and build upon the existing or pending improvements of the live systems, further leapfrogging the innovation. But before you dive into the arcane of the latest gold elastic token, it&amp;rsquo;s worth making sure you understand the underlying models behind these projects. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-ample-bases-for-elastic-currencies&#34;&gt;1. Ample Bases for Elastic Currencies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, both models are building on the previous Ampleforth model which pioneered &amp;ldquo;elastic currencies&amp;rdquo; that have a supply reacting to the markets&amp;rsquo; conditions. The main issue with Ampleforth is that everyone is exposed to the rebases, hindering the usability of the AMPL as a medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the two new iterations address that with a different take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the seigniorage model, &lt;strong&gt;the rebase mechanism is split into a different token&lt;/strong&gt;, the share - paving the way for a more usable stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ESD model, there is still one token only but the DAO and LP lockup achieve a similar result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also introduce the mechanism of bond/coupons to &lt;strong&gt;add a positive incentive when the price is below peg&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to further stabilize the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, after we brush up on the basics, we will compare the Basis model (forked by MithCash, OneCoin, and more) to the ESD model (used in DSD, ZAI, DAIQ, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain the models in-depth but this table recaps the main differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;/&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;ESD = stablecoin &lt;br&gt; ESDS = 1 ESD claim while in expansionary phases&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2--gas-efficiency-overview&#34;&gt;2. ⛽ Gas Efficiency Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into the details of each item, here&amp;rsquo;s another key part of the systems to consider if you want to partake in them: how gas efficient are they, for the user?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find here some pointers on the amount of transaction and transaction flows required to partake in different parts of the system we described, helping you assess if it would make sense for you, gas-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;strong&gt;liquidity providing positions are the most transaction-intensive&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in the ESD model where you need to bound and unbound your LP tokens &amp;amp; claim rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-lp---basis-&#34;&gt;2.1. LP - Basis ⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stake LP token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: Claim (stream)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstake LP token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lp---esd-&#34;&gt;2.2. LP - ESD ⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stage -&amp;gt; Bound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward Claim: Unstage-&amp;gt; Stage-&amp;gt; (wait 5 epochs) -&amp;gt; Claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstage -&amp;gt; (wait 5 epochs) -&amp;gt; Unbound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the share/DAO side, &lt;strong&gt;the flow is less transaction-heavy&lt;/strong&gt;, so it&amp;rsquo;s better for smaller holders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;23-basis---boardroom-&#34;&gt;2.3. Basis - Boardroom ⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stake BAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: Claim (after the end of an epoch when BAC&amp;gt;1.05)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstake BAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: During expansion phases, you can let BAC accumulate in the boardroom and claim several days of reward at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;24-esd---dao-&#34;&gt;2.4. ESD - DAO ⭐⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stage ESD -&amp;gt; Bound ESD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: no transaction required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstage ESD -&amp;gt; (wait 15 epochs) -&amp;gt; Unbound ESD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: During expansion phases, the rewards produced by the DAO are automatically compounded (=bounded) without action required from the user-end.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not qualified to provide any. It’s a mere technical analysis of two seigniorage systems implemented live in production: a farmer’s report 🚜&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we are up to date on each model and their gas efficiency, let&amp;rsquo;s details their benefits and downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31--benefits-of-the-basis-model&#34;&gt;3.1. 👍 Benefits of the Basis model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;311-more-liquid-pools&#34;&gt;3.1.1. More liquid pools
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Basis model, the &lt;strong&gt;BAC/DAI liquidity pool is continuously rewarded with BAS token&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the BAS reward continues even when BAC is in a contraction phase, we&amp;rsquo;re not observing the same compounded reduction of liquidity seen in contraction on the ESD model: when the ESD price is on a downtrend &amp;amp; liquidity providers are pulling out at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/liquidity-esd-bac.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquidity-esd-bac-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that &lt;strong&gt;ESD&amp;rsquo;s liquidity tends to be more spikey&lt;/strong&gt; while BAC&amp;rsquo;s is correlated mostly to BAC price (expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;312-fluid-share&#34;&gt;3.1.2. Fluid share
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share is fluid in the sense that there is currently no commitment required to be eligible for the Boardroom BAC. While this can also make the BAS price harder to stabilize, it makes the expansion-reward component of the system more broadly accessible and less game-able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;313-better-coupons&#34;&gt;3.1.3. Better Coupons
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis Coupons (BAB - Bounds) have no expiration date&lt;/strong&gt;. They can be redeemed for 1 BAC as long as BAC is &amp;gt; 1.05. It makes buying coupons less of a gamble than on ESD where they expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;314-third-party-integradable&#34;&gt;3.1.4. Third Party Integradable
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewards in the Basis model are distributed through &lt;strong&gt;standard staking contract&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling and facilitating the integration by third parties. There are already Harvest &amp;amp; Pickle vaults to streamline the farming of the BAC/DAI, BAS/DAI, MIC/USDT &amp;amp; MIS/USDT pools.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;harvest-basis-cash-mith-cash&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32--downsides-of-the-basis-model&#34;&gt;3.2. 👎 Downsides of the Basis model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;321-the-share-has-low-utility-when-baclt1&#34;&gt;3.2.1. The share has low utility when BAC&amp;lt;1
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main and by far biggest weakness so far of the current implementation of the Basis model is the &lt;strong&gt;overall weak utility of the share token&lt;/strong&gt;. In expansion phases, its price is usually appreciating because of the newly minted BAC it gives access to. However, there is very little utility for BAS in contraction phases, except for its governance power. In contraction, the only potential earning option is to commit to the BAS/DAI pool for additional BAS, but it&amp;rsquo;s very risky play with a bearing BAS price action (contraction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several projects are already working on solutions to address this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;322-share-price-100-correlated-to-stable-price&#34;&gt;3.2.2. Share price 100% correlated to stable price
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second downside is a direct consequence of the first. Because of the lack of utility of BAS outside of BAC in expansion, &lt;strong&gt;its price is directly correlated to the BAC price&lt;/strong&gt;. Additional utility on BAS could enable both tokens to have more independent cycles, bringing more stability overall to the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33--benefits-of-the-esd-model&#34;&gt;3.3. 👍 Benefits of the ESD model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;331-more-committed-holders&#34;&gt;3.3.1. More committed holders
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ESD model, there is &lt;strong&gt;no access to the newly minted ESD without committing for several epochs&lt;/strong&gt;, at least 5 with the LP. It makes large holders more likely to be actively involved in the minting and stabilizing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;332-adjust-more-dynamically-to-markets-conditions&#34;&gt;3.3.2. Adjust more dynamically to markets&amp;rsquo; conditions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the ESD system operates on a &lt;strong&gt;timeframe three times shorter than Basis&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for more fluid and dynamic adjustments. DSD goes even further with 2 hours epoch (= 12x Basis pace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;34--downsides-of-the-esd-model&#34;&gt;3.4. 👎 Downsides of the ESD model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;341-overall-complexity-of-the-system&#34;&gt;3.4.1. Overall complexity of the system
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the additional lockups, staging, and bounding required to implement the share functionality directly at the stablecoin level, ESD-based systems tend to be more &lt;strong&gt;complex to apprehend&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for newcomers. You can even see it in the memes, where ESD/DSD players love to meme themselves as high-IQ masterminds. The coupon expiration makes the stabilization system extremely unfriendly for newcomers, which is not necessarily a bad thing per se, but see the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;342-weaker-coupon-incentive&#34;&gt;3.4.2. Weaker coupon incentive
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESD coupons have an expiration date, turning the coupon system into a bit of Russian roulette. Because of this design, there are serious risks of losing all the capital committed while burning ESD for coupons, even if the ESD system sustains itself in the long run. Indeed, once ESD is burnt into coupon, the owner has &lt;strong&gt;90 epochs (~30 days) to redeem them before they expire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;343-newly-minted-esd-batches&#34;&gt;3.4.3. Newly minted ESD batches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the emission logic of ESD-based systems, coupled with the lockups period tend to produce &lt;strong&gt;“raindrop epochs”&lt;/strong&gt; where most of the newly minted ESD is unlocked, which can trigger violent price action on the stablecoin price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last expansion phase, the period around epoch 396 was famous and scared because most of the newly minted DSD was made transferrable over a very short window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/dsd-raindrop.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;DSD-epoch-396-397-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes this is DSD, but similar patterns are observed on ESD. It&amp;rsquo;s due to the DAO lockups and emission schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-the-algostable-toolbox&#34;&gt;4. The Algostable Toolbox
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I let you go, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview of the main tools useful to monitor and manage positions for all four projects. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky! There are some amazing community-build tools made to help you track algorithmic stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;

    &gt;Vfat in particular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been super reactive updating his tracking and management tools for the newer projects. It even includes a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://vfat.tools/seigniorage/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all four projects are supported in both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>🗡 Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/risk-tranching-defi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/risk-tranching-defi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/risk-tranching/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🗡 Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has grown tremendously over the past year, partly thanks to the appearance of more streamlined investment products such as Yearn&amp;rsquo;s or Harvest&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/vaults.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;vaults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to their architecture, they facilitate the mutualization of capital which enables smaller yet profitable investments on money markets and other DeFi services like Curve or SushiSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a necessary and much-welcomed layer, and several improvements are still to be made to streamline things even further and increase gas efficiency. However, I believe the bulk of the innovation this year will come from another front: risk management on the vault-type products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, several definancial primitives have been developed to provide more options to segregate and hedge risks. There are now credible insurance options available for DeFi, as well as a new approach (in DeFi) to better distribute the risk between consenting and informed actors: tranching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll dive right in, but just before that, I think it&amp;rsquo;s apt to examine the terminology too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-lending-protocols-to-money-markets&#34;&gt;From Lending Protocols to Money Markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been reading me for a while, you might have seen the term &amp;ldquo;lending protocol&amp;rdquo; being used. While it was suited to describe their first purpose, I believe the concept has now outgrown the word, so I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to them as money market from now on. Indeed, &amp;ldquo;lending protocol&amp;rdquo; fails to capture all the subtleties now offered by services like Aave — I&amp;rsquo;m actually a bit late to the party of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the change of nomenclature reflects the different stages of evolution of these money markets. In their first months of existence, there was &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity imperative&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a fight to grow to a sizeable size, big enough to justify interest from other projects to integrate with the money market fuelling a positive growth loop as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen on Aave.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the critical mass is reached, &lt;strong&gt;the focus can and must evolve&lt;/strong&gt;. To further expand, the money market must extend its range of features - again, like we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Aave do with flashloans and fixed rate loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems clear now that &lt;strong&gt;the second phase of growth of the money markets will be feature-driven&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the base features available on the money market are essential, as these markets are more integrated into other DeFi protocols. The money markets with the most flexibility at the base layer will be able to handle more intricate use cases, such as credit delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, I want to focus this piece on a risk management concept that hasn&amp;rsquo;t found its way to a mainstream money market yet: &lt;strong&gt;tranching&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it can enable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tranching-would-you-like-another-slice-of-risk&#34;&gt;Tranching: would you like another slice of risk?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s start with &lt;strong&gt;the most straightforward &amp;ldquo;risk alteration&amp;rdquo; there is - tranching&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea here is quite straightforward: the different risk layers taken by the depositor of a given money market are tranched - meaning segregated one from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each depositor can choose his preferred exposure. It enables, for instance, a confident degen to &lt;strong&gt;bear all available layers of risk to maximize his APY&lt;/strong&gt; while a more conservative whale could &lt;strong&gt;downsize its risk perimeter&lt;/strong&gt; by exposing oneself to the technical risk only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the core idea, but let&amp;rsquo;s not forget we&amp;rsquo;re talking about decentralized finance here, so &lt;strong&gt;composability is key&lt;/strong&gt;. What makes tranching so exciting is its future as a &lt;strong&gt;financial primitive&lt;/strong&gt; - a building block that other apps and projects can use to deliver new services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll explore more in-depth what tranching as financial primitive entails right after we consider how it currently works in practice, and examine the broader context of risk hedging and APY fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

You can picture these mechanisms enabling diverse types of risk exposure as building blocks making it possible to &lt;strong&gt;build end-user products fitting all ranges of risk appetite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explain why tranching matters more explicitly in the last part of this article where we consider some end-game scenarios for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-tranching-in-practice&#34;&gt;Risk tranching in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole article was actually inspired by a tweet I published where I shared what a tranched aDAI could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, there is mostly one product delivering tranching on mainnet I&amp;rsquo;m looking at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://saffron.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Saffron Finance&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a tranching abstraction layer built on top of the Compound DAI market. The risk segregation is straightforward with two main tranches + one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;AA tranche&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;covered in case of platform failure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;A tranche&lt;/strong&gt;, supplying the cover for the AA tranche (= slashing if a failure occurs) but earns a much &lt;strong&gt;more favorable APY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a third tranche - the &lt;strong&gt;S tranche&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it is simply rebalancing between the two others as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tranching occurs on an epoch-basis, currently set at two weeks. So if you supply the A tranche, for instance, you are bearing the risk of platform failure for the AA tranche for a 2 week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the excitement that followed the launch, Saffron grew to close to $60M assets deposited. Since then, the dust settled around a low bar of roughly $15M of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of every epochs, depositors are not earning rewards anymore until they pull out and deposit in the next epoch tranches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saffron is looking to expand to other money markets, most obviously Aave and expand their token coverage (currently only DAI). Other projects are exploring the idea of tranching, most notably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://barnbridge.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BarnBridge&lt;/a&gt;, but their current achievements are less enticing in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last minute edit: BarnBridge &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CoinbaseCustody/status/1348739247277268997&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BOND token is now listed on Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a more practical understanding of tranching and how it can work, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back to understand what it provides in the broader context of risk management in decentralized finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-broader-context-of-risk-management-in-defi&#34;&gt;Understanding the broader context of risk management in DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on the sole risk related to the definancial product itself: mainly smart contract risks, oracle, and economic attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ve left at least two layers of risk untouched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APY Variation&lt;/strong&gt;: The APY of the service used is usually variable, so there is an additional layer of exposure there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token Price Fluctuation&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, the returns are paid in token different from the ones deposited. If the payout token is not a stablecoin, its price can vary - meaning there is yet an additional layer of exposure to consider here if we want to be exhaustive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, to fully understand the broader context, let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that there are several distinct &amp;ldquo;temporal approaches&amp;rdquo; to risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an approach such as tranching, you can be &lt;strong&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt;, splitting the risk &lt;strong&gt;beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; between participants that understand their exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can also go hand in hand with more &lt;strong&gt;reactive approaches&lt;/strong&gt;, such as insurance - a system providing payout &lt;strong&gt;afterward&lt;/strong&gt; in the event of a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance markets are another fascinating topic by themselves, so we&amp;rsquo;ll stick to this simple mention for now and go back to our yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re talking about insurance, a fascinating project just launched - Unslashed Finance. It&amp;rsquo;s made in France by a builder I admire, so I&amp;rsquo;m a little biased, but feel free &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/unslashed/manifesto-for-a-decentralised-crypto-insurance-unslashed-finance-873078fd0ddd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to read their manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-take-on-risk-management-for-yields-apy-fixation&#34;&gt;Another take on risk management for yields: APY-fixation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we were saying, the APY of the different yield products available in decentralized finance are constantly fluctuating. It makes for a less predictable income and prevents the entry of investors who are not willing to stomach several layers of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, another layer of meta-financial services is emerging - the base value proposition as an investor is quite simple: they offer a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY on depositors&amp;rsquo; investments&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially another flavor of &amp;ldquo;insurance&amp;rdquo;: you&amp;rsquo;ll get overall a bit of a lower yield, but it&amp;rsquo;s predictable. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to a stable-interest loan on Aave (vs variable rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyer side of such services is super interesting: picture it &lt;strong&gt;like a prediction market, for the yield of a given vault or investment product.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers deposit some assets and place a bet on the expected average yield: the closer their prediction is, the better is the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see the buyer side becoming mainstream anytime soon, but it provides the backbone to yet another useful financial primitive useful to provide services more suited to more risk-averse investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apy-fixation-in-practice&#34;&gt;APY-Fixation in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, there are two projects working on delivering fixed-APY yield on popular decentralized investment products such as the Yearn vaults: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://88mph.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;88mph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Saffron, 88mph is another abstraction layer built on top of Compound, Aave, and Harvest deposits. It provides a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY for depositors&lt;/strong&gt;, while on the other side of the market buyers of floating-rate bonds are bearing the risk of the fluctuations of the APY of the underlying investment product.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-the-endgame-look-like&#34;&gt;What does the endgame look like?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wrap this up with a little thought experiment. We&amp;rsquo;re now leaving the present and what is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet to extrapolate a bit and consider what tranching &amp;amp; other risk management approaches can enable in DeFi a few months or years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment product built, for instance, on the Aave money market:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a Saffron-like product integrated into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also with an 88mph-like service integrated into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, an insurance such as Unslashed also natively integrated for the DAI peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could envision &lt;strong&gt;the first &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; DeFi investment&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be a wrapped deposit of say DAI on Aave, coming along with tranching to only bear the price risk hedged by a coverage against DAI losing its peg on Unslashed earning a fixed APY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s insane to consider the different steps of the evolution of let&amp;rsquo;s say DAI we witnessed or are about to witness in barely two years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest-bearing&lt;/strong&gt; DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a fixed APY &lt;strong&gt;not bearing the technical risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a fixed APY not bearing the technical risks &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;covered against DAI losing its peg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aFIXEDAPYDAI_PEGINSURED: our new monetary overlord? The actual name will be way more catchy, rest assured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to witness &lt;strong&gt;the future of money unfolding methodically before your very eyes as your assets receive software updates&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one cannot wait: I&amp;rsquo;ve been prepping for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The state &amp; future of algorithmic stablecoins</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-state-future-of-algorithmic-stablecoins/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-state-future-of-algorithmic-stablecoins/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The state &amp; future of algorithmic stablecoins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of December, a new trend has been shaping up in DeFi: algorithmic stablecoins. Several projects launched and saw significant growth, attracting even more interest for this subset of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what they are and what they entail, let&amp;rsquo;s first discuss the addressable markets. Stablecoins on Ethereum are massive: they are around 20B USDT circulating, 3.5B USDC &amp;amp; 1B DAI. As you can see, right now most of the volume is served by stablecoins requiring some forms of trust, such as &lt;strong&gt;USDC or USDT: the emitting company has the power to freeze assets and manipulate balances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maker explored another approach with DAI that has significantly fewer compromises - however, the scalability is lowered. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to consider DAI &amp;ldquo;sufficiently trustless&amp;rdquo; today when the majority of the collaterals used to mint it are not (USDC, wBTC, TUSD, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the recap here would be that so far, there is &lt;strong&gt;an obvious unsatisfied demand&lt;/strong&gt; in stablecoin - the ones that scaled did it with significant compromises, which enabled them to satisfy markets despite being services requiring trust, and more or less worthy of it (especially USDT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this piece today is that after following developments on the stablecoin space for years - it seems like we&amp;rsquo;re reaching an exciting breakthrough with a new generation of stablecoins able to offer &lt;strong&gt;both scalability and credible trustlessness&lt;/strong&gt;. The topic is neither simple nor easily accessible, especially for newcomers. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to walk you through the thought process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-uncompromisingly-trustless-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Why do we need uncompromisingly trustless stablecoins?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what project does what to what end, let&amp;rsquo;s take another step back. We&amp;rsquo;ve established that there is a significant demand for stablecoins, and none of the current leading offers are sufficiently trustless. But what does it mean exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;trustless means that the whole system does not require any central point of trust to operate smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s often mentioned with &amp;ldquo;censorship resistance&amp;rdquo;, a different property that stems from trustlessness. So from a practical perspective, here are some question to help you assess trustlessness: the more permissive the permissions, the less trustless the project tend to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can token balances be seized or frozen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the protocol&amp;rsquo;s code or parameters be updated? In which conditions? By who?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the protocol dependant on 3rd-party services, such as price feed (oracle) that could be manipulated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who/what can print new tokens? Is that user-initiated (someone takes an action) or protocol initiated (a decision the protocol makes based on given parameters)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last question is particularly insightful, as it highlights a core component of algorithmic stablecoins: &lt;strong&gt;their &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; is a smart contract&lt;/strong&gt; — no one controls it, it simply reacts to the system parameters. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive more into this right below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this piece, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the main models available: Ampleforth, Basis Cash, Empty Set Dollar, and Dynamic Set Dollar. I&amp;rsquo;ll not dive into the history of the space and the specificities of each model, feel free to check this article from Deribit Insights if you need more context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stability-elasticity-and-reflexivity-a-deep-dive-into-algorithmic-stablecoins/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Stability, Elasticity, and Reflexivity: A Deep Dive into Algorithmic Stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of diving into each system&amp;rsquo;s details, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw &lt;strong&gt;a sketch showing the core principles this generation of stablecoin is built upon&lt;/strong&gt;, based on the common parameters and design approaches shared in all projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;central-smart-contract&#34;&gt;Central Smart Contract
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first interesting dimension is the &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; of the system - aka who/what can print new tokens and under what conditions? &lt;strong&gt;USDC &amp;amp; USDT pretty much replicate a central bank&lt;/strong&gt; - one entity is in charge of the project and emitting new tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Maker is just a smart contract enabling its users to mint DAI from certain collaterals, the approach is different here. Essentially &lt;strong&gt;Maker/DAI enables you to be your own central bank&lt;/strong&gt;. So the central bank of Maker is a smart contract, but it requires human input to mint DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithmic stablecoins go even further, as &lt;strong&gt;the human input is removed from the minting process.&lt;/strong&gt; In these systems, no one has the capacity to mint tokens - only the smart contract operating it can. It&amp;rsquo;s very elegant and minimal, but it requires a carefully designed set of incentives to make sure the stablecoin will eventually hedge towards its peg. To put it simply, &lt;strong&gt;with algorithmic stablecoins, the central bank is an autonomous smart contract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-army-of-stabilizers&#34;&gt;An Army of Stabilizers
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With algorithmic stablecoins, especially in their early days, peg breaks are frequent. To push the stablecoin back to the peg, the protocols have different kinds of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the stablecoin is worth over $1, &lt;strong&gt;the protocol mints new tokens and distribute them as an incentive&lt;/strong&gt; to users providing liquidity or locking their token, which helps to push the price back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the stablecoin trades below $1, the coupons (or bond) system kicks in: &lt;strong&gt;users can burn their stablecoins for a coupon&lt;/strong&gt; representing it + a premium. However, they will only be able to redeem the coupon once the price is back over the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, at a high level, these mechanisms are simple. They have intricacies that you need to master if you want to partake in the system. &lt;strong&gt;Users understanding them and following them can help the protocol stabilize&lt;/strong&gt;, and if it does they might earn in the process. So these simple rules lead to the emergence of an army of stabilizers, who make use of all the mechanisms to stabilize the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design pushes both game theory and the meme-game to another level:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggressive-expansion-phase&#34;&gt;Aggressive Expansion Phase
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the supply of algorithmic stablecoin is elastic, their mechanism is quickly battle-tested. Indeed, at launch, the circulating supply of the stablecoin is usually low and the attractive incentives create a lot of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;strong&gt;Basis Cash launched with 50 000 BAC tokens&lt;/strong&gt; distributed to the first stakers. Roughly a month after, there are now &lt;strong&gt;40M BAC circulating&lt;/strong&gt;: they were produced because BAC has been trading &amp;gt;$1 most days since the launch. So far, there was no phase where BAC&amp;rsquo;s TWAP &amp;lt; $1, so the Basis&amp;rsquo; coupon system (BAB) has not been tested yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Basis Cash has 24h epoch. ESD is 8h and DSD is 2h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, ESD and DSD already saw several cycles of expansion and contraction each, with the protocol operating as intended:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harnessing-defi-composability&#34;&gt;Harnessing DeFi composability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key principle of algorithmic stablecoins is composability. We often think of it as &amp;ldquo;how can I plug my finished product/service into others?&amp;rdquo;. These projects go much further, as &lt;strong&gt;they use other protocols like Uniswap as a central part of their system.&lt;/strong&gt; Basis, ESD and DSD all have three main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An internal locking/staking mechanism for expansion phases (DAO or Boardroom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A burn&amp;amp;redeem mechanism for contraction phases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Uniswap pair (/USDC or /DAI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their very structure demonstrates an understanding of DeFi and its composability. By placing the Uniswap-pair(s) at the core of the protocol, it helps on so many levels - since &lt;strong&gt;Uniswap is staple DeFi users are familiar with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap is the main pool, the liquidity on other DEXes is increasingly looked at. With the launch of Omakase, Sushi added two new incentivized algorithmic stablecoin pools: ESD/ETH &amp;amp; DSD/USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composability is key for algorithmic stablecoins and several projects are already taking steps to get more integrated within the ecosystem. Within the next few months, we should see the next steps of this with the arrival of some algorithmic stablecoin as collateral on lending platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oracle-minimalism&#34;&gt;Oracle Minimalism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle are used as a base parameter in the algorithmic stablecoin system:: they are the &lt;strong&gt;source of truth for the price of the stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. Making sure the oracle is resilient and cannot be gamed is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, the previous generation of projects, especially Maker, tended to overengineer things. In the early days, Maker&amp;rsquo;s input parameter was almost the pure &amp;amp; raw price of ETH. However, to make the system less prone to &amp;ldquo;flash liquidations&amp;rdquo;, Maker built their own oracle, and use several delays and averages with the liquidation price to &lt;strong&gt;add some inertia to their system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before our algorithmic stablecoins tend to be minimalist and harness the composability of DeFi. &lt;strong&gt;With their Uniswap pairs, they already have a decent price feed with significant liquidity, making it hard to manipulate&lt;/strong&gt;. So the Uniswap price is used as the based, but generally computed as a TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) to avoid price manipulations right before rebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being minimalist, the systems are efficient and elegant: as these stablecoins projects grow, so should their liquidity on Uniswap, making the oracle more resilient and the price harder to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one am excited as to where this subset of the space is heading. Whether you intend to partake or not in the bootstrapping phase of such stablecoins, I think it&amp;rsquo;s highly valuable to document yourself on them as they are a good tell of the main trends of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-algorithmic-stablecoin-toolbox&#34;&gt;🧰 Algorithmic Stablecoin Toolbox
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we part way, allow me to share some useful tools to track the evolution of these stablecoins. First, each project has its own tracker providing the main metrics for the current epoch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bc.tools/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Basis Cash Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;ESD Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dsd.tools/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DSD Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can view more granual details about the ESD and DSD system on this dashboard: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://duneanalytics.com/tongnk/esd_1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a qualified financial advisor, but who gives a fuck really? This is DeFi we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve felt legitimate to write this piece because I&amp;rsquo;ve been following closely Basis Cash, Empty Set Dollar, and Dynamic Set Dollar closely, as well as Basis Dollar &amp;amp; Share less attentively. Frax is another hybrid project that is worth looking at - I did not discus it as I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar enough with it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yearn Finance&#39;s Merger Spree</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/yearn-finances-merger-spree/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/yearn-finances-merger-spree/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-merger/y-among-us.gif" alt="Featured image of post Yearn Finance&#39;s Merger Spree" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn Finance has been making headlines lately with the announcement of &lt;strong&gt;several acquisitions&lt;/strong&gt; like Pickle Finance or SushiSwap. The Yearn team has joined its development forces with five other DeFi projects already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grasp what&amp;rsquo;s happening, we&amp;rsquo;ll look back at the main events since September and how each of the different sub-projects is now working to achieve a shared goal. While Yearn is still relatively new, there are already many chapters to its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to better understand the latest events - the merger spree, let&amp;rsquo;s first quickly consider the three phases of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s development and how they led to today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beginnings of Yearn with the fair launch of the YFI token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How YFI&amp;rsquo;s launch became a template with the waifus (forks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of the Yearn Ecosystem: Yearn beyond the vaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yearns-backstory-launch-waifus--the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Backstory: Launch, waifus &amp;amp; the ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last June, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s token launch was a unique moment, initiating what is now called a &amp;ldquo;fair launch&amp;rdquo;. Essentially, the &lt;strong&gt;YFI token was distributed over a week to users&lt;/strong&gt; depositing to several pools related to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s products. Feel free to check &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my first story on Yearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It translated into a growing awareness for the project, a rapid price appreciation of the token, and attracted involved DeFi users to contribute to Yearn through the DAO&amp;rsquo;s discussions. The launch was so successful that it actually became a template replicated more or less successfully by many other projects: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-waifus.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s waifus (forks)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Yearn was focusing on its own products, the main ones being the vaults enabling streamlined implementations of farming strategies. The vaults too grew beyond Yearn to become a product offered by many DeFi services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction was not exactly clear back then. Indeed, there were many products being worked on, such as yBorrow, ySwap, yinsure, or the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decrypt.co/43292/eminence-finance-exploit-leads-to-degen-soul-searching&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Eminence exploit&lt;/a&gt;. However, the core product, the vaults saw little improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last few months, the vision for Yearn&amp;rsquo;s development evolved. Instead of an inward-facing plan focused on the ecosystem, the Yearn team started to look outward. At the same moment, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s DAO was structuring its processes and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-54-formalize-operations-funding/7956&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;formalized operations fundings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to the current merger phase - joining development efforts with other DeFi projects on relevant areas of expertise. Token-wise, nothing is changed, each project keeps its own token and sovereignty over it. So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yearns-mergers&#34;&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Mergers
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the context set, let&amp;rsquo;s now look at the different projects joining forces with Yearn and how they contribute to add value to the offering. We&amp;rsquo;ll consider them as they happened, in their chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some of these mergers are still pending a token holder vote to be validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A NFT was made to immortalize this moment of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s history: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:90731:0xac6d5c44c7a089101c53735211b12f5f722c7688&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pickle-finance-1124&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance (11/24)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: PICKLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Streamlined investment products (vaults)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;symbiotic relationship&amp;rdquo; with Pickle Finance was the first to be introduced on November 24. The idea is to merge the efforts of the two projects currently offering similar products. Pickle will now deliver an &lt;strong&gt;incentive mechanism on top of the Yearn vaults&lt;/strong&gt; through gauges, similar to Curve&amp;rsquo;s current model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By joining forces, it creates additional options for Yearn vaults depositors while securing the assets deposited in the Pickle jars, one of which was subject to a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cointelegraph.com/news/pickle-in-a-pickle-as-attacker-swipes-20-million-in-evil-jar-exploit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;$20 million exploit &lt;/a&gt;shortly before the merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cream-finance-1126&#34;&gt;Cream Finance (11/26)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: CREAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Money Market - Lending &amp;amp; Borrowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger with Cream is even more exciting as it would expand the range of strategies Yearn vaults could use. Cream is a lending platform, a fork of Compound with several changes including the collateral accepted. yUSD (Yearn yCRV vault share) has been supported as collateral for a few months already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two teams teaming up mean a more systematic approach, eventually &lt;strong&gt;paving the way for leveraged vaults&lt;/strong&gt;: the vault token share being used as collateral on Cream to borrow more stablecoin and increase exposure. Cream would eventually become the lending arm of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More info in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cover-protocol-1128&#34;&gt;Cover Protocol (11/28)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: COVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Peer to peer coverage market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn has been trying to provide coverage and insurance for its products, with projects like yInsure. So working with another project on this front is highly synergistic, since it could enable &lt;strong&gt;coverage for Yearn vaults&lt;/strong&gt; while allowing the team to focus on its core offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cover-merger-651142828c45&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the announcement here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;akropolis-1130&#34;&gt;Akropolis (11/30)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: AKRO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Streamlined investment products (vaults)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t expand too much into this one, as it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Pickle. Akropolis was providing services similar to the vaults, so &lt;strong&gt;joining forces allow increasing TVL&lt;/strong&gt; by creating another frontend for Yearn/Pickle while beefing up the security of Akropolis, as it too suffered &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://news.bitcoin.com/hackers-drain-2-million-in-dai-from-defi-protocol-akropolis/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an exploit for $2M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sushiswap-1201&#34;&gt;SushiSwap (12/01)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: SUSHI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Decentralized Exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sushi is now &lt;strong&gt;the second DEX by volume&lt;/strong&gt; with roughly half ($889M) of the total value locked of Uniswap. To attract liquidity to the platform, Sushi distributes its token to the providers of liquidity on certain key pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could allow Yearn to &lt;strong&gt;incentivize liquidity providing for critical pairs of the Yearn ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;, such as a CRV &amp;lt;&amp;gt; yyveCRV to drive deposit into this vault which can provide additional returns for other Yearn deposits on Curve. The team joins efforts so that Sushi/0xMaki can lead the AMM efforts amongst the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-for-yearn&#34;&gt;What does it mean for Yearn?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this merger spree is a &lt;strong&gt;massive increase in Yearn&amp;rsquo;s firepower&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;strong&gt;form of recentering&lt;/strong&gt;: some key parts of the ecosystem are delegated, such as the AMM (swaps) to Sushiswap&amp;rsquo;s team, or the lending markets to Cream. It should enable the team to move faster on its core products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now so many mergers announced that CoinGecko created a category to track them: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=yearn-yfi-partnerships-mergers&amp;amp;view=market&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🦎YFI Partnerships &amp;amp; Mergers Coins by Market Capitalization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, composability is key and Yearn is yet another demonstration of what it can achieve. Indeed, there is one last dimension to stress with these mergers: liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these 5 acquisitions, Yearn will roughly triple its total value of assets locked across its ecosystem. Along with the synergies, it could help Yearn develop a moat that will be hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeFi is a toolbox reaching beyond finance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/defi-is-a-toolbox-reaching-beyond-finance/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/defi-is-a-toolbox-reaching-beyond-finance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post DeFi is a toolbox reaching beyond finance" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance is ready to grow beyond its sandbox: with a dense network of financial primitives, it&amp;rsquo;s now easier than ever to harness DeFi for other ends, such as to replace a predatory relic of our past like the lottery, still insanely popular and detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this story, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take a step back and adopt a macro perspective on Ethereum. So far, my interest mostly revolved around decentralized finance, as it drove the innovation over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I believe we&amp;rsquo;re reaching the next step of the growth of the incredible human coordination experiment that is the Ethereum network: the lego blocks provided by DeFi are now mature enough to be harnessed for other ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we&amp;rsquo;re now seeing how these &lt;strong&gt;streamlined value capture and exchange devices&lt;/strong&gt; can be harnessed to facilitate the creation of engaged communities or sustain the commons. So this time, instead of what or how, let&amp;rsquo;s ask why? After a quick reminder on the key benefits delivered by DeFi legos, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a few projects harnessing them to flip the table in their respective domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defis-legos-the-core-building-blocks&#34;&gt;DeFi&amp;rsquo;s Legos: The core building blocks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myriad of decentralized financial services available on Ethereum demonstrated the benefits of what I like to call &amp;ldquo;pragmatic values&amp;rdquo;: transparency, accessibility, accountability, and interoperability. Why pragmatic? Because withholding them is not a matter of goodwill of the system&amp;rsquo;s participants, they are &lt;strong&gt;enforced by default and continuously as long as the network is operating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask your bank how your money is invested, you get an answer you can trust or not. Verifying it involves inquiries from your end. On the other hand, you don&amp;rsquo;t ask Yearn where your money is: you see what it&amp;rsquo;s doing at all times, and this information is reliable and unfalsifiable. It&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental change in the relationship - the user of a DeFi service is not a mere &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute to unpack these core pragmatic values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: By default, transactions on the Ethereum network are public. For DeFi, this translates into very concrete benefits - for instance, volumes &lt;strong&gt;observed (on the chain)&lt;/strong&gt; on decentralized exchanges tend to be much more realistic than volumes &lt;strong&gt;reported&lt;/strong&gt; by centralized exchanges (tracked in their internal database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: To use a DeFi service, such as an exchange or an asset management system, all you need is an Ethereum wallet and a device with an internet connection. On unstoppable services like the DEX Uniswap, there is no way to blacklist an address from using it. This has obvious benefits for populations usually discriminated against by financial services operators, such as gamblers, sex workers, or foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability:&lt;/strong&gt; DeFi services are like lego blocks, they are open source so that they can be improved and built on top of. It enables rapid innovations as new projects can quickly deliver value by assembling several existing services in new ways. Everyone can check their code and easily contribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalism&lt;/strong&gt;: Ethereum is a network designed for resiliency and it comes with interesting consequences. With a highly redundant infrastructure where bandwidth and storage capacity are limited, successful projects tend to be those able to reduce or avoid unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeFi ecosystem delivered a range of services thanks to which anyone can buy, sell, secure, exchange tokens in a decentralized fashion. They also &lt;strong&gt;normalized behaviors that were uncommon before&lt;/strong&gt;, such as staking tokens, borrowing, using leverage, minting synthetic assets, and many other options made possible once assets are tokenized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I was saying in the introduction, so far these new legos have been used mostly in a reflexive manner. Now, they are increasingly used to deliver innovative services offering even more possibilities. It&amp;rsquo;s essential as each new DeFi layer enables many more use cases outside of finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixing-a-detrimental-societal-institution-using-defis-legos&#34;&gt;Fixing a detrimental societal institution using DeFi&amp;rsquo;s legos
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious and trickle down from here: fixing the lottery. As you probably already know, lotteries are poverty traps sometimes described as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/state-lotteries-are-an-exploitative-tax-on-the-poor/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an exploitative tax on the poor&lt;/a&gt;. Their public is predominantly poor, and overall the lottery is not helping with their budget. Even with a lucky outcome, other issues arise sometimes leading right back to the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with the lottery has many roots, including the fact that they are usually owned or operated by national governments. The good news is that DeFi can deliver the core element of the lottery - the prize - in a much more sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to deliver a jackpot, you need some form of prize. Current lottery models pool together contributions from everyone to return it to one player, minus the cost of the operations and a fee: money is &amp;ldquo;burned&amp;rdquo; within the base loop because of the infrastructure required to run the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi can do much better on both fronts. First, for the prize: instead of a net-loss system, PoolTogether provides a &lt;strong&gt;no-loss lottery&lt;/strong&gt; to its players. The gist is simple: they are not buying a ticket but instead depositing stablecoins into a pool. Assets from all players are used to produce a return using the decentralized lending markets. The &lt;strong&gt;winner earns the interest generated by the whole capital over the period, and everyone gets back their initial investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also comes with many improvements over legacy lotteries infrastructure: using Ethereum tokens to represent lottery tickets comes with additional benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; - drawing the winner and paying the prize is much faster, public, and verifiable by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traceability&lt;/strong&gt; - every operation is public and auditable, making it easier to prevent frauds and abuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt; - all you need is a wallet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lottery example is essential to better understand &amp;ldquo;DeFi+&amp;rdquo; use cases. DeFi by itself is amazing. But &lt;strong&gt;using DeFi to replace predatory societal infrastructure? Sounds like even closer to its reason to be!&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ll explore this theme further by looking at the funding of public goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enabling-sustainable-commons-gitcoin&#34;&gt;Enabling sustainable commons: Gitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decentralized DeFi projects, the community is key as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;we’ve seen with Yearn Finance&lt;/a&gt;. On top of their role of driving the project development and growth, communities also frequently deliver key resources, such as dashboards, calculators &amp;amp; diverse tools to facilitate the tracking and management of positions, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zerion.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zerion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the macro level, the main tools used to track the overall growth of the industry also stem from the community, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defillama.com/home&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFillama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarming.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YieldFarmingInfo&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarmingtools.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YieldFarmingTools&lt;/a&gt;. The development of such services is usually fueled thanks to community donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the discovery and funding of such projects, there is a platform harnessing the possibilities offered by Ethereum to improve public good funding: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://gitcoin.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. Gitcoin streamlines the creation of “Grants” to collect donations for given projects and communities. It makes the most of Ethereum core attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/gitcoin-grants.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Gitcoin-grants-round7&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All donations are public and transparent&lt;/strong&gt;, making it easy to measure and track contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects can be funded with common Ethereum-based tokens, usually stablecoins such as DAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the community is the main driver of contributions, Gitcoin uses a system called quadratic funding to balance contributions. Each round, &lt;strong&gt;it matches contributors&amp;rsquo; donations&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to an additional budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The budget is provided by donors from the ecosystem. While it used to be mostly large Ethereum-based companies, a new type of sponsor is emerging: treasury funds of DeFi projects. Indeed, some key DeFi players like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-direct-of-rewards-towards-ethereum-public-goods-funding/3699/22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn Finance voted to allocate a portion (1%)&lt;/a&gt; of their protocol income to fund Gitcoin grants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still room for improvement - and Gitcoin keeps getting better with every new matching round - it’s already a critical part of the infrastructure used to fund the commons on Ethereum. It really streamlines the process of collecting donations for community-driven projects. We use it for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR newsletter&lt;/a&gt; along with other sources, and it’s part of what is enabling us to deliver a high-quality yet free newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Gitcoin grants round just started. You can give to support your favorite projects with an additional matching until December 17. Allow me to suggest a selection of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/collections?featured=true&amp;amp;collection_id=24&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;people documenting DeFi in non-English languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - just like I try to do with French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to support French DeFi particularly, feel free to check the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr-the-daily-gwei-fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR &amp;amp; DailyGweiFR grants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a pair of newsletter offering two different takes to learn about DeFi, in French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another subset of the Ethereum ecosystem has been delivering incredible value for community building lately: non-fungible tokens (NFT). While the term is a mouthful, the base idea is actually quite simple: NFTs deliver another level of digital scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find a detailed explainer on NFT two years ago, still relevant and accessible for newcomers: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with DeFi, NFTs are now enabling new forms of community interactions and fundings. Using &lt;strong&gt;self-serve platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, artists and communities can autonomously create and sell NFTs with services streamlining the process like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their programmable nature, NFTs enable &lt;strong&gt;new re-distribution models&lt;/strong&gt; such as a contribution on secondary market purchases. Finally, since they live on the Ethereum blockchain, NFTs also provide a transparent history of ownership and previous prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again, thanks to Jon (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/otherbright&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;@OtherBright&lt;/a&gt;), BanklessFR has been exploring this new frontier too. Thanks to a collaboration with the artist Arke, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:43413:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;we’ve released a NFT&lt;/a&gt; tied to the newsletter&amp;rsquo;s content. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked Jon to share some pointers on the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://banklessfr.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedailygweifr.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Daily Gwei FR&lt;/a&gt; we are trying different experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Arke56374430&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Arke&lt;/a&gt;, we started with the sale of a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:43413:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR NFT&lt;/a&gt;, representing the newsletter BanklessFR. This collectible card, available in 40 copies, was successfully sold at 0.15 ETH each. We shared the profits with the artist. We included an article that can be unlocked at the time of purchase, 24 hours ahead of readers who do not have the card. This distribution model is clearly innovative, but in my opinion requires to be developed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:64356:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;second sale&lt;/a&gt;, different from the first, still for BanklessFR, illustrated an article, and offered 10 copies of the card, at 0.3 ETH per unit. It also contained an article that could be unlocked 24 hours in advance. The latter worked much less, certainly because of a relatively high price, despite a rarity 4 times greater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/the-daily-gwei-fr.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;TheDailyGwei-FR-NFT&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:81692:0x83ac01254b0b8e9745492c5e73f5f32a05570a76?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;last sale&lt;/a&gt; concerns the launch of The Daily Gwei FR. We published 50 copies of a card representing the newsletter. We haven&amp;rsquo;t sold one yet, 0.05 ETH per card, 50 cards available. We will modify this sale to continue the experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have other ideas in mind, here the experiments are relatively simple, but much more complex systems should be implemented. I think we should insist on funding from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;gitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://clr.fund/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;clr.fund&lt;/a&gt;, before accelerating on the NFTs side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these services provide innovative tools to build and grow communities. Thanks to the disintermediation, NFTs put artists back at the center of the stage. We&amp;rsquo;re seeing more and more instances of collaboration between an artist and a community, like we did for BanklessFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;re entering an age of renewed excitement, especially for people outside the space, make sure to direct newcomers to reliable resources: how about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/-guide-1-starting-with-bankless&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bankless&amp;rsquo;s getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-markets-blackhole&#34;&gt;The markets blackhole
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, the trajectory of the last couple of years of development makes even more sense. The financial functions were the necessary first steps, as they now operate as primitive enabling more intricate interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their very base, &lt;strong&gt;markets simply are distribution/allocation mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. So far, in the world of old finance, we&amp;rsquo;ve let technocrats design them, to the benefits of the most connected and rich participants. With DeFi, we&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with our own ways of creating markets. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen migrations of billions over a few days to chase a given incentive such as Uniswap UNI mining or the one-week YFI mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly put, our finance is already strongly superior to any meatspace counterpart. We can create immense and healthy markets in days. Have derivatives and other options for the next one. Leverage soon after. &amp;amp; all/most of this delivered in an unstoppable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a trader, this might sound like tooling overkill. It&amp;rsquo;s really not. Picture finance like a base layer underlying all the others. Whatever your goal is, your system will probably have to manage some finite resources, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our markets - our base layers - are more efficient than any other so we can reasonably expect a compounding impact of this increased efficiency as we move down the stack. Simply put, finance is the first battlefield we&amp;rsquo;ve won: the decentralized approach succeeded and delivered a superior infrastructure without equivalent. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the next!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🤖 Vaults: DeFi Investing Streamlined?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/vaults-defi-investing-streamlined/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/vaults-defi-investing-streamlined/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/vaults/harvest.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🤖 Vaults: DeFi Investing Streamlined?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the ecosystem of decentralized financial services on Ethereum grows and matures, the service offering is becoming more dense and sometimes hard to understand. While the most technically savvy users can chase the latest releases and hedge their risk appropriately, less-seasoned investors might feel left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are DeFi services made to match the diverse set of investors exploring the space. Yearn Finance was the first platform to pioneer a passive-type of investment products: vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base idea is simple as 1, 2, 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaults are &lt;strong&gt;tokenized investment strategies&lt;/strong&gt;: your deposit is represented by a token (for instance, yCRV in Yearn’s Vault -&amp;gt; yyCRV/yUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vault frequently harvest and re-invest the profits&lt;/strong&gt; (here CRV) to purchase more of the base asset supplied, compounding the returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees are streamlined&lt;/strong&gt;: the depositors do not pay for the gas costs of the vaults operation (such as harvesting). Fees are usually charged while exiting the vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;strong&gt;avoid the headaches&lt;/strong&gt; of chasing the latest farm, managing the claim of the profits you earn, when and how to reinvest them, without forgetting, of course, to account for the gas costs of all these operations in the calculation of your profits, vaults are a credible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaults are made to &lt;strong&gt;abstract the complexity for the end-users&lt;/strong&gt;. You deposit some tokens and wait while they are farming a set strategy for you. So let&amp;rsquo;s see what options are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplest-basic-vaults&#34;&gt;Simplest: Basic Vaults
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaults use the token you deposit (DAI for instance) to farm a given strategy, produce a return and re-invest it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneer is of course Yearn with the yCRV vault, but several options are now available or progressively rolling out. This article provides a structured overview of the main earning opportunities enabled by vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, you deposit a given token to earn more of it over time, and potentially additional reward. The tokens you are supplying are not used to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges, &lt;strong&gt;so there is no exposure to impermanent losses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;as more and more vault-types products are being released, you want to take the time to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the one you choose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you will find tables summarizing the main vaults that I know of, with the tokens they accept, the service they farm, and how the return is denominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mention &amp;ldquo;returns normalized to the base&amp;rdquo; means that the strategy generates a return frequently settled for the base token supplied - this operation is sometimes referred to as “harvesting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequency of the harvest is important as it will influence the compounding factor of the overall position, as well as level of risk taken on the price of the farmed token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins--btc-vaults&#34;&gt;Stablecoins &amp;amp; BTC Vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vaults, the most common tokens accepted as deposits are stablecoins. Such vaults will deploy your capital on Curve Finance pool to earn CRV tokens, usually the Y pool, . More recent projects, such as Pickle Finance also enables farming from the Curve sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some services like Harvest or YFV have an incentive model on top of their vault: depositors earn the governance token of the platform (FARM or YFV) on top of the base return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Curve also supports tokenized BTC pools, there are now vaults for them too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FARMS ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;wBTC, renBTC &amp;amp; CRVRENWBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Rewards normalized to the base&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Harvest.Finance, you can deposit wBTC or renBTC directly, or the CRVRENWBTC token, which represents a deposit in Curve&amp;rsquo;s Pool 5 (RenBTC &amp;amp; wBTC pool).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth-based-vaults&#34;&gt;ETH-Based Vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTC &amp;amp; Stablecoins positions are interesting, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;d like to keep an exposure to the price ETH?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can achieve such a result by yourself by leveraging your ETH. You&amp;rsquo;ll use them as collateral to mint or borrow stablecoins/wBTC that are then deployed to produce a return superior to your borrowing cost: here&amp;rsquo;s an article I wrote providing tips and tools to leverage ETH efficiently - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/leveraging-ETH.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with such a position, you can be exposed to liquidations if the price of ETH was to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Yearn was the pioneer here with the release of the wETH vault that automated this whole process. However, the volume of deposit was massive and the service ran into some technical issues currently being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of waiting for the re-release of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s wETH vault, why not consider the &lt;strong&gt;existing available options&lt;/strong&gt;? They are not as intricate as Yearn&amp;rsquo;s wETH, since they do not leverage your ETH; the ETH is simply deposited somewhere to produce a return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FARMS ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Yearn Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Maker + Curve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Normalized to ETH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Cream Deposit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Cream returns normalized to wETH + FARM return (fwETH staking)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;YFV&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Soda&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Soda returns normalized to wETH + VALUE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;DFI.Money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Returns normalized to wETH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve stuck to &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; vaults where you deposit a given token, let it sit for a while, and hopefully walk out of there with more of it (+potentially some governance extra tokens). Yet, the release of Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s UNI token, another kind of riskier vault is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;riskier-uniswap-uni-farming-vaults&#34;&gt;Riskier: Uniswap UNI-farming Vaults
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;uni-farming-basics&#34;&gt;UNI farming basics
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the release of the UNI token came a distribution program instauring UNI incentives on specific pools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/USDT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/wBTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you provide liquidity on any of the pools listed above, you can stake your liquidity pool token for an additional UNI income directly on Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s website. You&amp;rsquo;ll be earning UNI continuously. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage the position yourself, which means claiming the UNI (and pay the associated gas costs), as well as selling and reinvesting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These strategies are riskier than ETH/BTC/Stablecoins vaults. Indeed, while farming UNI tokens you are providing liquidity on Uniswap, which comes with a risk of impermanent losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why face the hassle of &amp;ldquo;manual farming&amp;rdquo; when you can &lt;strong&gt;let a vault do the hard work for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uni-farming-using-a-vault&#34;&gt;UNI farming using a Vault
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, quickly after the launch of Uniswap, several services started offering vault-type products to streamline the farming of UNI. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKENS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/USDC, ETH/DAI, ETH/USDT, ETH/wBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + FARM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + PICKLE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;YFV&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/USDC, ETH/wBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + VALUE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive. Only vaults are included - services which automatically re-invest the profits for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other opportunities exist to farm UNI, but they require more intervention from your end. For instance, with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://sakeswap.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Sake Swap&lt;/a&gt; you can stake your ETH-Stable Uni-V2 LP tokens to earn both UNI &amp;amp; SAKE tokens. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to claim and manage the SAKE &amp;amp; UNI tokens earned yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about a given vault and how they operate, feel free to check their resources. Yearn and Harvest Finance have great documentation with infographics explaining their vaults:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-waifus/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Yearn Finance&#39;s Forks: The State of the Waifus Family" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day a new Yearn fork is popping up: how to keep track with them? There is no simple answer to this dilemma, however, I believe I can &lt;strong&gt;provide you with some clues to help you spot YFI fork with high potential.&lt;/strong&gt; To do so, I’ll cover three (+1) YFI forks and try to pinpoint the changes to the secret sauce that made them stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn is more than Yearn.Finance product itself: it became a template to kickstart a project, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;fair launch&amp;rdquo;. Yearn pioneered the method which stands on three key elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Mining Fair Launch&lt;/strong&gt;: the initial distribution of the token of the platform (ex: YFI) happens through liquidity mining. Supporters can stake tokens like yCRV to earn the governance token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community-Driven Development&lt;/strong&gt;: the decisions regarding the development of the project are taken by the community of token holders, through informal and formal (on-chain) votes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pooled Investment Strategies (Vaults)&lt;/strong&gt;: the Yearn-inspired projects usually also try to replicate this core feature of Yearn: they offer tokenised investment strategies. The vaults are essential for the long-term success of the project past the initial liquidity mining phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Basic Vault&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, where tokens are collected and stake to produce a yield. The yield produced is frequently settled for stablecoins (no leverage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Delegated Vault&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, where once tokens are deposited, they are used as collateral (thanks to credit delegation) to borrow stablecoins then used to produce a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegated Vaults are much more complex to develop and implement, while basic vaults can be sprung quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfi-wifey-wai-fu&#34;&gt;YFI? Wifey? Wai-fu?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Yearn, people were unclear on how to pronounce &amp;ldquo;YFI&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/make-yfi-pronounced-waifu/552&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;A discussion on the governance forum&lt;/a&gt; settled for &amp;ldquo;Wai-fu&amp;rdquo; (/waɪfu/). From this point onward, there was only one wai-fu but plenty of wifeys: the YFI forks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, despite being barely a few months old, &lt;strong&gt;Yearn has already been forked, a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. There is now a whole family of wifeys built upon similar premises, each project adjusting different parameters to attempt to better fit their envisioned use case. Many of these forks were unnecessary, however, &lt;strong&gt;several managed to bring something new and exciting to the table&lt;/strong&gt; —  the ones we will consider today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This content assumes an understanding of Yearn, to brush up on the topic I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;my previous article on Yearn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dfimoney-yfiihttpdfimoney&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://dfi.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DFI.Money (YFII)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest discussion in Yearn&amp;rsquo;s community was around the &lt;strong&gt;emission schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: while it was initially planned for a week, there were discussions about extending it - most notably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yips.yearn.finance/YIPS/yip-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YIP 8&lt;/a&gt; which proposed a longer emission schedule halving weekly. &lt;strong&gt;Despite support from the Yearn Community, the proposal did not meet the quorum and was not implemented&lt;/strong&gt;, which lead to the YFII fork** - a fork of YFI implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;instead of having a week-only distribution, YFII opted for a longer schedule, still ongoing.&lt;/strong&gt; It started July 27 and will end on October 5. The farming pools proposed are very similar to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s: staking the yCRV token or staking the Balancer pool token (98%DAI / 2 % YFII).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this base differentiation, YFII develops an interesting angle with a &lt;strong&gt;strong presence in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;: the DFI.Money website was quickly translated into Chinese and soon other languages. There is also a strong &lt;strong&gt;focus on UX&lt;/strong&gt; to make the experience as easy as possible to onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 14, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DfiMoney/status/1305339433638531072?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DFI.Money launched the v2 of their vaults&lt;/a&gt;, supporting ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, TUSD, BUSD, HBTC, &amp;amp; yCRV. As this piece was written, there was a total of $70M deposited into DFI&amp;rsquo;s vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is not an exhaustive overview of YFI forks. There were other forks of Yearn with minimal changes that are not covered, such as YFFI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yflink-yflhttpyflinkio&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://yflink.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFLink (YFL)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFL is another one of the early forks of YFI. Here, the twist is simple:** LINK was used as the base token of the system** - the one to deposit for the initial liquidity mining phase. The farming pools structure was similar to YFI/YFII, but with LINK/aLINK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial vision was to create a farming collaborative for LINK holders. YFL was developed by 5 anonymous teams working together and initially released on August 7 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-waifus/Linkswap.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;YFL LinkSwap&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth was quick and the plan soon refined! YFLink is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@linkswapco/yf-link-ecosystem-linkswap-development-update-44f8413721c9&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;now working on LINKSwap&lt;/a&gt;, a community-governed Automated Market Maker (AMM), focusing on safety and value capture for LINK holders. LINKSwap explores novel ideas to increase investors&amp;rsquo; safety - for instance, the RugLock feature, designed to avoid rug pulls - when the token’s creators drain the liquidity pools, leaving holders with a sizeable bag of worthless coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfvalue-yfvhttpyfvfinance&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://yfv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFValue (YFV)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFValue adds several more twists, with a similar goal of providing a service facilitating yieldfarming and making it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the farming pools were mostly 98% ERC20-token / 2% YFV Balancer pools and the emission schedule is much longer (5 to 20 weeks) - it&amp;rsquo;s still ongoing while &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/yfv-bringing-true-value-to-yield-farming-bddc4edf889a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFV launched mid-August.&lt;/a&gt; There is also a &amp;ldquo;seed pool&amp;rdquo; accepting stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV was one of the first project to provide credible earning opportunities on tokens such as BAL, YFI, BAT, REN, KNC, BTC, WETH, or LINK: it really helped to attract liquidity — there are around $470 M deposited on YFV as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;YFV Staking Interface&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV&amp;rsquo;s core product, the Governance Vault was just &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/roadmap-update-value-contract-governance-vault-e226ad2f909e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;launched on September 15&lt;/a&gt;. YFV Holders can stake their token for several benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting power in the governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A return paid in vUSD and vETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV token from the emission schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV tokens earned from the strategy implemented with the Governance vaults funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV tokens earned from buying back YFV with 6.8% of the profits made with the vaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV is a highly ambitious project. The vaults (wETH, wBTC, renBTC) are expected shortly. On top of the existing farms and governance structure, the team is working on transitioning to an AMM/farming collaborative called Value Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFValue is in the process of transitioning to VALUE (token) and Value Liquid (name of the exchange/service). You’ll find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/faq-yfv-and-value-migration-af3a5a5c2190&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more information on this rebranding and transition here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfinspired---harvestfinance-farmhttpsharvestfinance&#34;&gt;YFInspired - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest.Finance (FARM)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Harvest.Finance is technically not a fork of Yearn, one could say it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;fork in spirit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, Harvest ambitions to streamline yieldfarming to make it more accessible &amp;amp; it&amp;rsquo;s quite a success: Harvest is now home to more than $200 M (+200 M) of diverse assets farming with no stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience on Harvest is quite straightforward, just like with the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s vault. &lt;strong&gt;Users deposit tokens into the strategy of their choice to put them to work&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, they deposit their DAI to get fDAI, DAI currently farming on Swerve.fi.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Harvest Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once they own fDAI (or other fTokens), users can stake them to earn FARM - the native token of the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; They can also provide liquidity to the fDAI/DAI pair on Uniswap which facilitates the entry and exit of smaller capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvest.Finance launched on September 15 a new vault accepting for wETH. The community is highly active and committed, and it shows in the reactivity of the team: to better the yield, the stablecoin farms (DAI, USDC, USDT) switched from the Curve strategy to Swerve barely 16 hours after &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://swerve.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Swerve&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope these quick introductions will help to better understand the recipe for a successful YFI fork. Considering the sample size (3+1), it’s hard to draw some conclusions but allow me to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I see a YFI-Fork scoring some resilience points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;focuses on a clearly identified community&lt;/strong&gt; (ex: LINK holders for YFLINK).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol parameters (pools, tokens, etc.) are adjusted to match the target community wants and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A one-week emission schedule was a luxury only affordable by the first Waifu,&lt;/strong&gt; mother of all others (YFI). Successful YFI-forks tend to need a longer schedule (5-20 weeks) to gather and structure their community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A farm by itself is not enough, there is a real need for &lt;strong&gt;a convincing vision for the project in the long-run&lt;/strong&gt;, such as an AMM (YFL/YFV), or going above and beyond on the farming front (Harvest), and more than anything a driven and dedicated community to support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 🧭 DeFi Moneygames: Assessing risk and avoiding wreckage" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based social moneygames are all the rage in decentralised finance. Today, I wanted to write a quick piece to provide some context on them, as well as some tips for those who want to. I&amp;rsquo;ll not pass moral judgement on such projects, I leave it up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of Yearn Finance last month was probably the most significant event of the year for DeFi. If you are not familiar at all with Yearn, check this intro: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - it will be helpful to better understand today&amp;rsquo;s article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s token, YFI was highly innovative back then: 100% of the supply has been distributed to users providing liquidity on different pools tied to the protocol. This launch framework has now become a template replicated by countless projects which spun out in the wake of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s tremendous success: YFII, YFL, YAM, SHRIMP, PASTA, BASED, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this base building block of &amp;ldquo;the farming cooperative&amp;rdquo; provided by Yearn, many projects add a tokonomics twist to their base asset, hoping to make it more sticky. Here are the usual suspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deflationary model&lt;/strong&gt; (this is usually stupid) - &lt;strong&gt;RUN&lt;/strong&gt;. Example: PASTA. (RIP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rebase mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; (it can get interesting - increases information asymmetry). What matters here is finding a relevant price target &amp;amp; making sure the rebase code is not faulty / not leading to issues with other parts of the protocol such as the liquidity pools (Hello YAM). Sadly, it also contributes to turning the game into a ponzi-esque situation where inexperienced investors get plundered by experienced farmers - rebase mechanisms make it tricky to calculate returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social-based mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;, such as a daily/weekly bonus for the top X holders, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Taconomics101&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TACO&lt;/a&gt;, or double rewards every Tuesday because Taco Tuesdays are REAL!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some, the &lt;strong&gt;main value stems from the community angle&lt;/strong&gt; rather than the tokonomics, like for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://shrimp.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Shrimp&lt;/a&gt; which ambitions to become more community-driven than other similar projects by enabling the creation of advanced pool (incentivised in SHRIMP) by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a common thread to filter the noise, &lt;strong&gt;governance is a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s a necessity and ultimately a key factor in the success of all these projects&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at the kind of decisions that are made, what is the process, and who is shaping the project, ect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have the base concept and it&amp;rsquo;s so simple and plug and play that we &lt;strong&gt;could create a foodcoin together for the fun&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture $WINE. You farm it by locking DeFi tokens for the first week. Then a WINE/ETH pool will be incentivized for longer (high potential to be a dumping pool, more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WINE is already highly memable and has an emoji, good starting point! However we need more, we need some fun and stickiness to it, how about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top holder has a 20% chance of getting &amp;ldquo;Drunk&amp;rdquo; daily. If that happens, he will be a generous drunkie donating 20% of all his WINE to 100 random daily active addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get too tipsy either: each WINE transaction has a 1% chance of sending 50% of the value transferred to the reward contract instead - increasing the rewards for farmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those mechanisms are profoundly uninspired, but they give you a picture of how easy those concepts are to come by. They can also be implemented very quickly thanks to code blocks (such as the staking contracts) forked from standards (such as Synthetix staking contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$WINE does not exist. DO NOT buy $WINE. DO buy wine! 🍷&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough for the context and the theory - I might dive into the community dimensions of the game in the next post. But for today, allow me to share some practical wisdom on these games earned sweating my gwei out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-tips-if-you-are-playing-food-based-moneygames&#34;&gt;Practical tips if you are playing food-based moneygames
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, mind the gas!&lt;/strong&gt; Farming the meme-food coins usually require you to at least stake and then claim/exit. Depending on the pools you are farming you might also have to add liquidity to decentralized exchanges - making the position more intricate and costlier to unfurl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly, NEVER BUY THE FOOD TOKENS - farm them.&lt;/strong&gt; Buying such a token is taking on an incredible amount of risk - you are against an army of people farming them for free who can be eager to dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s get a bit more practical by looking at real examples to explicit the risk scenario of each farming pool types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--1---erc-20-staking-pool---ok-if-the-code-is-safu&#34;&gt;LEVEL = 1 - ERC 20 STAKING POOL - OK IF THE CODE IS SAFU
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With such pools, you stake a DeFi token (usually MKR, COMP, SNX, LEND, wETH and YFI) to earn the meme food token, YAM for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is minimized: if you can compare the staking code with an existing one to ensure there are no shenanigans. Since you&amp;rsquo;re simply staking and not providing liquidity - you&amp;rsquo;re not taking any economic risks. As long as you can ensure the safety of the protocol - your farm capital is not endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past this point (SAFU confirmed), the main risk you are taking is that the coin you are farming might be worth little to nothing by the time you have enough to dump. Stick to reasonable projects to avoid such a scenario known as as the &amp;ldquo;death spiral&amp;rdquo; - when a meme coin enters the final phase of its existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/pasta-deathloop.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-moneygames-PASTA-deathloop&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--2---982-pools&#34;&gt;LEVEL = 2 - 98%/2% POOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pools are usually more tricky, as they involve providing liquidity to a decentralised exchange. Often, they are heavily skewed towards a sound &amp;amp; reputable token: for instance, the YFLink 98% aLINK / 2% YFL pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;strong&gt;you are facing a new type of risk: impermanent losses.&lt;/strong&gt; IL are greatest when the two assets involved in the pool are moving fast in opposite directions, price-wise. 98/2% pools have their own category because they are a bit safer, although they are not fully immune to IL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/yfv.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-moneygames-YFV&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--rekt---the-dumping-pools&#34;&gt;LEVEL = REK&amp;rsquo;T - THE DUMPING POOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pools are the MOST dangerous. I&amp;rsquo;d advise anyone needing guidance to simply avoid them - the game is too risky to be played. A great example of why is the PASTA yyCRV / PASTA Uniswap pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put it like this: if some can farm PASTA essentially for free by locking some DeFi tokens - why would they not dump them all for yyCRV, the soundest money-making machine of the industry? That is precisely what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the incentivised pool launched, PASTA farmers dumped heavily to claim those precious yyCRV fools put up for grabs. Why would they not? The price of PASTA tanked from roughly $1 to $0.04, butchering any profit made by those who committed to the pools on top of them losing their precious yyCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what qualifies a pool as the dumping pool? &lt;strong&gt;Allow me to be super explicit here to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not going hara-kiri with your precious tokens&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool is usually 50/50&lt;/strong&gt;: 50 of the meme shitcoin, 50 of a sound asset like ETH, wETH or yyCRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool is incentivized with a high budget&lt;/strong&gt;- how else would you get plebs to commit? Of course, this profit is hard to realise as most of the capital is lost to IL, and the returns are earned in the foodcoin which can enter the death spiral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool usually launches a few days after the first ones&lt;/strong&gt;, and last longer. Indeed, you need to give a few days for the farmers to accumulate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m just a simple farmer - follow a legend like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1296619171984232448?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DegenSpartan&lt;/a&gt; - he&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to announce his dumps publicly (shortly) after they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, and remember one thing if you recently joined the space: the food money games are played against experienced traders with years of crypto experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most are 0 sum games: no value is created, it&amp;rsquo;s just a complex 3-4 layers value transfer mechanism.&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you confident enough in your experience to venture into the lions&amp;rsquo; den?&lt;/strong&gt; If not, stand clear of anything past the basic staking pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a financial advisor - you make your own decision. I have no formal training or certification when it comes to investing. I&amp;rsquo;m merely sharing my personal experience with decentralised finance services, with the goal of helping my peers to better understand the value provided by such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am NOT responsible for &lt;u&gt;YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, may they bring you Lambos or bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/yearnfinance-defi-on-autopilot/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/yearnfinance-defi-on-autopilot/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-finance-YFI/wifeys.jpg" alt="Featured image of post YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Yearn v2 release and the launch of the YFI token (pronounced &amp;ldquo;Waifu&amp;rdquo;) shook decentralised finance. Indeed, the whole recipe was there: Yearn is like a robo advisor, it helps you save and grow a capital - obviously one of the most thought after use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than the product itself, core to defining what Yearn became was its founder Andre Cronje, &lt;strong&gt;his choice of fully opening the governance&lt;/strong&gt;, and the amazing community that soon federated around the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this piece today, I want to share some pointers to understand why Yearn came to be, how it works, and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-yearn&#34;&gt;What is Yearn?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Yearn started with a simple promise: it &lt;strong&gt;helped you get the best lending rate available at any time on a given stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed as there were more and more options to lend stablecoins (Compound, Aave, dYdX, etc.), yield optimization quickly became essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn v2 already brought a new product to the market, the yVaults: they go beyond yield optimization (rebalancing stablecoins between several lending platforms) to provide more returns. Let’s see how this work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;end-user-perspective-deposit-wait-money-go-up&#34;&gt;End-User Perspective: Deposit, Wait, Money go Up
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go in the specifics, here it&amp;rsquo;s how it works for an end-user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You own a token supported in the yVaults, such as LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can deposit your LINK in the yVault to start earning. Entry and exit to the vaults are gas optimised (usually ~$2-3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, you exit the pool. 0.5% of the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; value is taken by the system to cover all the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;strong&gt;enough time spent in the vault to make up for the exit cost&lt;/strong&gt;, investors walk out with a profit paid in the token they entered (ex: more LINK).&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure you know what you are getting into. Andre has quite an interesting approach, stated in his twitter bio &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1291252150635560960?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;I test in prod&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-happening-under-the-hood&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening under the hood?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;yVaults are amazing because &lt;strong&gt;they abstract an immense amount of complexity for the users,&lt;/strong&gt; and do it better than most of us. Going back to our yLINK vault, here&amp;rsquo;s what happens to provide the yields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINK are deposited on Aave (Credit Delegation) and used as collateral to open positions. The positions are maintained within a safe range using an safety mechanism (funded on the returns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stablecoins are borrowed and put to work to provide a return. The latest strategy farms the mUSD/USDC MTA Balancer Pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any actual returns of the farming portion of the position (stablecoins earned above the debt) are sold for LINK, increasing the effective returns of the whole position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of yVaults is that &lt;strong&gt;they harness DeFi synergies to provide yields on autopilot.&lt;/strong&gt; They are designed to be flexible with their capital allocation - so that it can easily be re-allocated to follow a different strategy with better yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each vault has a different strategy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a neat explainer graphics made to explain the yCRV vault strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining this one would be another article by itself, so I&amp;rsquo;ll let you dig the graph and join the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/HFK5uea&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn Discord&lt;/a&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-yearn-is-unlike-anything-else-before&#34;&gt;Why Yearn is unlike anything else before
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is DeFi on steroids, and made possible by developments that occurred over the last year. Yearn is harnessing synergies between several &amp;ldquo;DeFi legos&amp;rdquo;. Without going too deep in, here are the key ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aave recently launched the Credit Delegation feature&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling a contract to open a position on your behalf. This feature was necessary for the yVaults to function as they do now, as they enable the first part of most strategies - getting leverage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEX &amp;amp; Automated Market Makers - especially &lt;strong&gt;Curve.fi&lt;/strong&gt;, an obvious dependency for the yCRV Vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall &lt;strong&gt;dynamism of the stablecoins markets&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to new entrants such as mStable or the COMP token release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn is the perfect example of DeFi composability!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-as-little-as-possible--assembling-legos&#34;&gt;Building as little as possible &amp;amp; assembling legos
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I focusing on this? Because as someone working in the DeFi space for two years, I can tell you that the biggest operational mistake I see ALL THE TIME - is simple: &lt;strong&gt;teams re-building the wheel - reinventing what already exists and working&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think DeFi projects (like most startups) would gain immensely from actively trying to reduce the scope of work they undertake - here are two amazing questions that should be asked more often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the unique value delivered by our product?&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do we need to deliver it? Can we harness existing solutions to achieve this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s structural design demonstrates a keen eye to identify high-potential DeFi projects and harness their synergies. In short, by &lt;strong&gt;assembling several DeFi legos together in an unprecedented way&lt;/strong&gt;, Andre efficiently delivered a brand new use case if not a new subset of the whole industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-defi-100-community-driven-project&#34;&gt;The first DeFi 100% community-driven project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This headline is not at attention grab, I stand by it as there is meat on the bone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, let us restress than &lt;strong&gt;Yearn has been a working product handling significant volumes for a while before the YFI token&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, you can add to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% of the tokens distributed to the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a novel liquidity mining approach, pertinent to the product (yCRV pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The community was quick to step up and is booming with well-articulated ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andre relinquished control of the main contracts governing the service, in favour of a multisig with reputable actors of the space.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I regard and value an open governance process as a net positive, at least in the long-run, this is also a risk - and &lt;strong&gt;this is usually how people in the industry reads it&lt;/strong&gt;. An open governance can be hijacked in a direction that does not match the best interest of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defiweb3---communities-hegemonize-brands&#34;&gt;DeFi/Web3 -&amp;gt; Communities Hegemonize Brands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not be on board yet, but for me, building and growing communities - that’s essentially my life. In the years I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it, I found no secret sauce yet I &lt;strong&gt;uncovered an obvious truth: communities &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; brands&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of DeFi, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the &lt;strong&gt;clash of brands&lt;/strong&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re about to witness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, VC-funded brand-companies tend to lack personality and have a harder time bolstering dynamic organic communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, a community-driven project is &lt;strong&gt;a story writing itself every day.&lt;/strong&gt; And when it comes to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s brand, we see it growing fast: the swag is already there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feeling-the-yearn&#34;&gt;Feeling the Yearn
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is so much more than yVaults! I focused this explainer on them for clarity, but there are several other Yearn products being developed. Without diving too much in, here some promising ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yborrow.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yBorrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a generalised credit delegation interface using Aave. What makes it amazing is the synergy with the vaults, it will enable anyone to access vaults like yCRV from an ERC-20 token they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ySwap: a novel automated market maker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mysterious leveraged stablecoin-farming solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-yearn-toolbox&#34;&gt;The Yearn ToolBox
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools and resources developed by the community that proves super helpful if you are exploring or using Yearn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.learnyearn.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LearnYearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A comprehensive Yearn wiki frequently updated!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://feel-the-yearn.vercel.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FeelTheYearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A simple page to get the current status of the vaults: assets locked in, assets deployed and the strategy used for each vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ycosystem.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YCosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A community aggregator to find all the useful links, from docs/YIP to where to purchase Yearn swag!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you are interested in Yearn, I URGE YOU to give the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;governance forum&lt;/a&gt; a read - you are forever invited to read and partake in the discussions shaping Yearn. This time, there is no VC, no BS - just a DAO and a one-man-army named &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Andre Cronje&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wifeys-family&#34;&gt;The Wifeys Family
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it would be dishonest to cover Yearn/YFI &amp;amp; without mentioning that YFI sparked a whole movement - there are now dozens of forks, more or less credible. While the first few ones where just &amp;ldquo;miners fork&amp;rdquo;, adjusting a few parameters, we&amp;rsquo;re now seeing more creative approaches. Indeed, Yearn is open source so easily forkable, and Andre even invited the community to get creative with it&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some communities are forking YFI to create their own pooled earning system, with a longer-term vision. It&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning but I think we will see fascinating development in that space. I think we will see communities reappropriating themselves parts if not the whole YFI system - remember the Wifeys family earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already starting! I&amp;rsquo;m following closely &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/yflink/the-idea-of-yflink-is-born-aa520921a4a3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFLink&lt;/a&gt;, a YFI fork adjusted for the needs of the LINK community. Right now, it looks like a farming cooperative, but the end game might be a community staking node - the perfect match!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to the Yearn and its family grow!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/leveraging-ETH/leveraging-ETH.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Ether giant seems to be waking up, you might be considering your &lt;strong&gt;options to recenter your exposure on ETH&lt;/strong&gt;. This is precisely what I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at and executed on lately, and now is the time for the feedback session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeFi is heating up and yields are attractive. However, &lt;strong&gt;even crazy liquidity mining returns (on stablecoins) might not beat the ETH price appreciation once its time comes.&lt;/strong&gt; So, instead of having to choose, why not have not both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this one goal in mind, the most obvious solution was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://makerdao.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt;. The position can, of course, be achieved using other services; I consider them at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have the base idea: instead of investing directly in ERC20 or stablecoins and putting them to work, you maintain an ETH base, use it to generate DAI and then diversify into your positions. This way, you maintain a healthy ETH exposure - the tradeoff being the additional risk, including liquidation that are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-investing-the-minted-dai&#34;&gt;Re-investing the minted DAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options to re-invest your DAI are pretty much infinite, so I will focus on these that make the most sense - aka the best at harnessing the current DAI premium. Feel free to check my previous publications covering incentivised liquidity pools investment opportunities &amp;amp; the useful tools to harness them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/defi-farmer-toolbox.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🧰 The DeFinancial Farming Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially when it comes to what makes of the DAI, you have several options, here are the broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMPLE STABLECOIN RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt; - Put your DAI to work, with a simple deposit on Compound or Aave, or using a yield optimiser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADV. STABLECOIN RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt; - Invest in Curve Ypool for decent returns + extra earning opportunities on your pool tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERC20 EXPOSURE (+LP)&lt;/strong&gt; - Purchase ERC20 tokens and hold or purchase ERC20 tokens and provide liquidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE ETH LEVERAGE&lt;/strong&gt; - Use the DAI to buy more ETH. Can be potentially repeated for more leverage (CAREFUL). This obviously makes the most sense when you&amp;rsquo;re expecting positive price action on ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAI is currently trading at a premium ($~1.03), some strategies are better than others to harness the impact of this spread. I detail them in the last section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vault-management-how-to-increase-gas-efficiency&#34;&gt;Vault Management: How to Increase Gas Efficiency?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making sure you&amp;rsquo;re not burning yourself on the gas costs, I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered several critical tools that we won&amp;rsquo;t detail again, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://zapper.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.Fi&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://paraswap.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt; for some token swaps. Today, I want to discuss services that are helpful to manage Maker vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While interacting with your vaults, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself make series of transactions (deposit ETH -&amp;gt; mint DAI -&amp;gt; do something with the DAI). To reduce your gas costs, you can &lt;strong&gt;use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://furucombo.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FuruCombo&lt;/a&gt; to build your series of operations and execute it in one transaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find yourself in need of a &amp;ldquo;flash capital&amp;rdquo; to close a position somewhere and re-open it somewhere else. If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, an Aave flash loan will be useful. Now for the best part: &lt;strong&gt;flash loans are available on FuruCombo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/leveraging-ETH/furucombo.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Collateral swap using Furucombo&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in these times of high gas cost, each interaction is costly. To reduce the impact of gas on your strategy, try to minimize the amount of operations you&amp;rsquo;re doing - FuruCombo is simply amazing for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have many positions to close/open, you might also want to wait for an opportunistic time to do so, where gas costs are low. The weekend evenings (Europe time) are usually best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-please-read-how-to-not-get-liquidated&#34;&gt;🚨 PLEASE READ: How to not get liquidated?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-makers-liquidation-mechanism&#34;&gt;Understanding Maker&amp;rsquo;s Liquidation Mechanism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get liquidated, (a part of) your collateral is seized to cover your debt. &lt;strong&gt;The existence of liquidation on Maker means you could lose potentially all of your ETH&lt;/strong&gt; if you are careless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my tips and recommendations to make sure this does not happen to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are just starting with leverage, maintain a very healthy collateralization ratio&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d recommend &amp;gt; 300 % for new users, simply for peace of mind during your discovery phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t put all of your eggs in one basket&lt;/strong&gt;: on Maker, you can open as many vaults as you want. While you don’t want to open hundreds of positions to keep the gas costs in check, you might also want to consider splitting your stash to not put all of your ETH under the same risk and be able to more gradually manage the positions as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Vault Management&lt;/strong&gt;: if you&amp;rsquo;d like a less stressful approach, you can use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your vault is automatically kept at a certain ratio with the Save function.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-vault-management&#34;&gt;Advanced Vault Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have several vaults, you can use a tool to re-distribute capital between them in one transaction, again with FuruCombo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Mint DAI on Vault1 (currently safe) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; Burn DAI on Vault2 to lower its risk
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a flash loan, you can even fully close a vault “into” another vault for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Flash loan DAI (=debt of Vault-1) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; Burn on Vault-1, to free the ETH 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Deposit the ETH in Vault-2 (the one you keep) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mint DAI on Vault2 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pay back the flash loan.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful with what you do with the DAI you mint: it&amp;rsquo;s a debt.&lt;/strong&gt; Prefer safer investment options. If you invest in something stupid &amp;amp; get rekt at the same time the ETH price is depreciating, you could be putting your ETH at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-maker-is-the-best-service-to-leverage-eth-right-now&#34;&gt;Why Maker is the best service to leverage ETH right now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus this article on Maker only, considering the angle is to leverage ETH and Maker is currently the best platform to do so, as well as probably the safest (running track record). Here are my main three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fits the bill&lt;/strong&gt; - It enables you to keep an ETH exposure while generating extra DAI to re-invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 fee if not liquidated - (⚠ gas costs)&lt;/strong&gt; The current stability fee is 0 (on ETH) - it costs you nothing but gas to open a position on Maker.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAI Premium -&lt;/strong&gt; DAI is frequently trading at $ 1.02-1.03 meaning minting DAI can result in a 2-3% instant profit on the amounts reinvested (more on this later - DAI premium section).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;this is NOW&lt;/strong&gt;, several weeks from now there might be better options for such positions, as Aave implements its new tokenomics for instance. A similar position could already be achieved today using Compound, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem profitable to do so right now (vs Maker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-this-strategy-for&#34;&gt;Who is this strategy for?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s quite a flexible strategy, &lt;strong&gt;it can be used by pretty much anyone owning ETH and looking for a way to put them to work.&lt;/strong&gt; However, allow me to highlight some use case scenarios that should give you ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve entered the markets recently (2019), and made profits but not really on ETH. While your ERC-20 positions are up, you might be wary about missing on ETH gains. To increase your exposure to ETH, you could settle some of your positions to ETH, open a vault, and reopen up to ⅔ of the closed ERC-20 positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been harnessing neat gains on the stablecoins farming lately, but even the best yields can&amp;rsquo;t beat a waking giant. You might consider buying ETH with your stablecoins, to then open a vault and reopen part of your stablecoin position - you keep some of your yields while adding a sweet exposure to ETH&amp;rsquo;s price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harnessing-the-dai-premium&#34;&gt;Harnessing the DAI Premium
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conclude, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the best options if your goal is to make the most of the current DAI premium - what does it impact most?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it&amp;rsquo;s very nice for ETH-leveraged long. Indeed, if DAI trades at $1.03, buying ETH from DAI is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are considering investing in the Curve y pool, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend going 100% from DAI. You&amp;rsquo;ll save gas cost massively on the swaps that are not required (+ less deposit and approve tx). On top of these savings, entering the Curve y pool fully in DAI usually has a positive price slippage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently it sits ~1.5% over 5000 DAI: that is 1.5% instant profit as you enter the position, quite attractive right?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Curve DAI Premium&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your risk preference and your capital, you might want to time your entry. I was able to harness up to a 3.5% positive bonus entering the ypool, so waiting can be worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-yield-farmer-tier-list/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-yield-farmer-tier-list/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi is like a layered yield cake. When you first walk through the door, making a deposit on Aave and seeing your balance grow puts you in awe. Shortly thereafter, through your own research or discussions with the community, you realize there is more to it &lt;strong&gt;- there could be icing on the cake too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you could find several streams of yields on a given capital utilizing Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance. &lt;strong&gt;Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll exclude out of the box any strategy involving leverage&lt;/strong&gt; - the easiest way to achieve such a feat. There are still a lot of high-quality crops to plant, even without leverage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, capital efficiency is increasing at a rapid pace in DeFi thanks to novel financial primitives like Compound, Balancer or Curve. It&amp;rsquo;s now possible to &lt;strong&gt;achieve up to 3 layers of returns&lt;/strong&gt;, and there are pools for any risk appetite, from pure stablecoins ones to 100% ERC-20 tokens exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liquidity Wars are merely beginning.&lt;/strong&gt; Follow the governance of the protocol you&amp;rsquo;re invested in closely, it&amp;rsquo;s even more critical now. Meanwhile, since DeFi feels more and more like gaming, allow me to import a concept inherited from there: tier list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In video games, tier lists are useful to navigate the different types of characters or builds. They establish both a typology and a ranking. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll bring this concept back to DeFi to arrange the most attractive liquidity pools into coherent groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-we-start&#34;&gt;BEFORE WE START
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ℹ Please note - This content assumes a basic understanding of the world of Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance. Refer to my earlier articles if that&amp;rsquo;s the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This piece will not cover basic DeFi investment strategies, detailed in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not investment advice and reading this document as anything more than a structured list of incentivised liquidity pools would be a misrepresentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;suggest-yours&#34;&gt;Suggest yours!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post can be a living document. Feel free to suggest incentivised pools I&amp;rsquo;ve missed. If you are familiar with Github, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TokenBrice/blog/blob/master/content/posts/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;you can do a pull request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If not, just reach out and share documentation about the pool and its incentive program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, allow me to make the distinction between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Mining&lt;/strong&gt;: a base action of the platform (such as supply liquidity) is rewarded with the platform native token (ex: BAL on Balancer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Incentive Programs&lt;/strong&gt;: a specific liquidity pool is eligible for extra rewards, through staking of the pool token or weekly distributions (ex: Wednesday for JRT Balancer pools).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is: you can stack both! Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before we chase our wildest dream, the highly-thought-after yield trifecta, let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute to consider what it looks like. When it comes to yields, the cream of the crop is usually an incentivised &amp;amp; balanced Balancer pool with low fees, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s eligible for the maximum amount of BAL liquidity mining rewards, on top of the liquidity incentive program (&amp;amp; the commissions on swaps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is exactly one Balancer pool matching these criteria with 2 stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; to my knowledge, so this is where we start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-50-musd--50-usdc-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;The 50% mUSD / 50% USDC Balancer Pool
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;mstable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a meta-stablecoin. You can go on their app to lock your USDT, USDC, DAI &amp;amp; TUSD to mint mUSD. Once you own mUSD, several earning opportunities are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most direct one is the &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo; feature on the mStable app. It will lock your mStable tokens and generate a return through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list/mstable.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;mstable&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s a simple yield and won&amp;rsquo;t deserve a feature here by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect introduction to the Balancer mUSD/USDC pool, our first trifecta of the day. What&amp;rsquo;s a trifecta you ask? Pretty simple: 3 layers of yields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commissions on swaps&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a liquidity pool facilitating trades and earning a fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAL liquidity mining&lt;/strong&gt;- this is a balanced 50/50 pool with low fee (5 bps) earning the maximum amount of BAL possible (mining factor = 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/mstable/introducing-meta-mta-mstables-protocol-token-6e1032291ccf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MTA liquidity incentives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program on this pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Variable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;?? BAL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;50 000 MTA/week&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Native rewards = earned in the same token as the exposure (usually a commission fee taken on trades facilitated)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: The respective ratios of four stablecoins backing the mUSD (half of the exposure) can vary, go to the m stable app&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to view it:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;mstable-asset-distribution&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pool is particularly attractive because the exposure is 100% stablecoin-based, despite a very solid yield thanks to the max BAL mining ratio + the incentive program paid in the highly anticipated MTA token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note/Warning: 💬 Discussions are ongoing in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.com/invite/ARJWaeF&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer Discord&lt;/a&gt; governance channel to lower the BAL mining ratio on this pool. It was lowered to 0.1 for tokens tracking the same asset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;90-snx--10-usdc-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;90% SNX / 10% USDC Balancer Pool
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel like you missed out on SNX rise? For medium capitals (&amp;lt; 5000 SNX) it makes little sense to stake if you account for the gas costs. This pool is a great alternative for a bullish SNX exposure with great yield potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;DONE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, since the pool is heavily skewed towards SNX, the BAL mining is not maximized. Remember the factor of 1 for the BAL mining on the mUSD pool? Here it&amp;rsquo;s 0.36: you get about a third of the amount of BAL you would mine in a 50/50 &amp;amp; low-fee pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 90/10 pools are great to heavily minimize impermanent losses risk if you believe the token has a lot of upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;incentive program on this pool is now over&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;rsquo;s back to being a regular twofecta pool.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, the exposure is 50 % ETH and 50 % AMPL.

    &gt;📖Incentive Program Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these two Curve pools have full exposure in a stable (USD) or relatively stable assets (BTC), they are a great resource to &amp;ldquo;park&amp;rdquo; profits realised on more risky ERC-20 based pools. You still &lt;strong&gt;maintain a decent APR on the base asset (~3-5%) while having a nice upside potential on the liquidity mining rewards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tier-3-twofecta-are-nice-too&#34;&gt;Tier 3: Twofecta are nice too!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-favorite-erc-20-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;Your Favorite ERC-20 Balancer Pool
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Balancer exchange comes with built-in BAL mining incentives. They apply to any pool involving whitelisted tokens. Therefore, any Balancer pool is already a twofecta: you&amp;rsquo;re eligible for commissions on the swaps facilitated + the BAL mining rewards. Please keep in mind that the pool weighting (ideally balanced) and fees (ideally low) affect the BAL mining ratio. The table below assume a ratio of 1, observed for instance on 50/50 pairs with 5 bps fees (0.05%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Balancer, Liquidity incentives programs are getting into fashion, expect more to be revealed, as well as liquidity mining programs. You can &lt;strong&gt;use a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pools.fyi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pool FYI&lt;/a&gt; which now has an &amp;ldquo;Incentivised&amp;rdquo; tag to check for the best opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;. For Balancer, use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/balancer/%5B%5D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compound-deposit&#34;&gt;Compound Deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of COMP, a Compound deposit could also be considered a twofecta. Indeed, on top of the base APR the deposit is earning, users are also now eligible for COMP rewards. You can &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/compound/None&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-risk-breakdown---read-this&#34;&gt;⚠ RISK BREAKDOWN - READ THIS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pool comes with its own sets of risk, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview to help you account for them. When you invest in a liquidity pool, you&amp;rsquo;re assuming the following risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ The base Ethereum network risk (51% attack, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ You&amp;rsquo;re also assuming the risk carried by the token contracts of any token involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ As well as the risk involved to the exchange&amp;rsquo;s contracts, which can be hacked or faulty to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ An economic risk, the impermanent losses (loss vs raw holding) - that will be heavily affected by your token choices &amp;amp; the pool weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/WHILE ENTERING &amp;amp; EXITING/ The risks associated with any service you use, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;, for the time of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will walk you through the risk profile of one of the pools to help you model it: the mUSD/USDC pool. Just like the returns, the risk profile is a cake with many layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t develop on the Ethereum network risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we have two tokens in the pool: mUSD &amp;amp; USDC. To compute the risk, we need to look at what&amp;rsquo;s backing mUSD - unwrapping, we&amp;rsquo;re exposed to: USDC, USDT, TUSD. Each of these tokens carry their own risks, since for instance &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001314526-Circle-USDC-Risk-Factors&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Circle can freeze USDC balances of any account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we&amp;rsquo;re using Balancer. Their contracts were audited by Trail of Bits recently&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, the protocol is quite recent. We&amp;rsquo;re also relying on mStable contracts for the mUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re lucky on the impermanent losses - considering the pool involves two stablecoins, the risk is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It all depends on the tools you&amp;rsquo;re using here. Bear in mind that you&amp;rsquo;re also assuming a risk associated with mUSD/Mstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy farming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it here, we will assume a shared basic understanding of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/yield-farming/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;what yield farming is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even have tried it by yourself, or heard the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/tales-from-a-yield-farmer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tales from a yield farmer&lt;/a&gt;: amazing! Today, it’s my turn to share key concepts &amp;amp; a curated list of tools to help you make the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by any chance you landed here without any idea of what &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethhub.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is, please click these links. This is not a guide, I keep it short &amp;amp; sweet with pointers only - Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;organic-defarming&#34;&gt;Organic DeFarming
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farming used to be simple: you planted some seeds and hopefully collected yields. Nowadays, we have some &lt;strong&gt;super crops&lt;/strong&gt;, landing extra yields on top of usual commissions on the swaps facilitated or fees collected on lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Essentially because &lt;strong&gt;some DeFi platforms like Compound or Balancer are now incentivising users to perform actions critical to the service;&lt;/strong&gt; such as supplying liquidity and borrowing for Compound. Their users are rewarded with their native governance token (COMP in this case). Pricing such token is a hard task the markets are currently crunching on. Price stability of these token may take time as they are currently in price discovery mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before we go any further, it’s time to hear a tale from Stani, an organic farmer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed is sustainable farming. In essence, farmers should farm quality crops by bringing quality liquidity for long term and keeping the seeds of these crops to expand their farms to new lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stani Kulechov, Aave&amp;rsquo;s CEO &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1276093091624226816?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll dive deeper into this later, but the overall &lt;strong&gt;high average gas prices are incentivising you to pick solid crops and stick with them&lt;/strong&gt; instead of foraging all around. For more context on liquidity mining, I’d also recommend reading this piece about the SAFG framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally the SAFG shifts us from a world of “buying to own” to one of “participating to govern,” which can ultimately result in more successful protocols and healthier communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-mining-sources&#34;&gt;Liquidity Mining Sources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the main liquidity mining sources, ordered by the share of tokens available through liquidity mining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancer Labs - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/proposing-balancer-liquidity-mining-cab4503972fa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL&lt;/a&gt; - 100M total supply, 75M distributed through liquidity mining (75%), since June 1 - includes some externally incentivized pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve Finance - CRV ??? - there is currently little to no public information available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound Finance - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;COMP&lt;/a&gt; - 10M total supply, ~4.2M through liquidity mining (42%), since June 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal Market Access - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defirate.com/safg/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UMA&lt;/a&gt; ~ 35% of the supply through mining (details TBD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetix &amp;amp; other incentives program (like JRT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jarvis x Aave &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sponsoring.jarvis.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adapting-the-strategy-to-your-budget&#34;&gt;Adapting the strategy to your budget
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we see how to get in and out of such positions, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a quick discussion on gas prices. They have been pretty high lately in a 25-35 gwei/fast range. Here&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it means for common operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Compound ($2-3 gas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Liquidity Pools @Zapper, an all-in-one tool to handle your liquidity providing positions, more on this below ($3-5 + swap fees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Liquidity Pools &amp;ldquo;manually&amp;rdquo; ($0.3 (approve) + $2-3 as many times as tokens as in the pool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exiting also has a cost, as well as any token swap required (like selling your COMP while exiting your position) $1-3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-cold-hard-look-at-gas-cost-impact-on-medium-capitals--2000&#34;&gt;A cold hard look at gas cost impact on medium capitals ($ 2000)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the returns over time of a 2 000 USDT Deposit @Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep this simple, we assume the current parameters will stay as such for the next year. &lt;strong&gt;This is obviously unrealistic - take this as a thought experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; Here were the parameters at the time of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4% APY on USDT on Compound = $80 for a year on the capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.66 COMP/year =~$150 produced by our capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table below, the &amp;ldquo;Actual Profits&amp;rdquo; column corresponds to a total exit of the position (back to USDT), which means effectively 3 transactions overall for the operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplying on Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing on Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling the COMP tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we look at this position with these assumptions over several time frames, here is what we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Timeframe&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Total Return ($)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Actual Profits ($)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Effective % return over the timeframe&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 day&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$0.63&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-0.42%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 week&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$4.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-$4.58&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-0.23%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$23.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$14.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.70%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;3 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$57.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$48.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;2.43%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;6 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$115.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$106.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;A year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$230.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$221.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;11.05%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: This simplistic scenario ignores the opportunity cost on ETH price. $5 of gas (=ETH) paid today might be worth $10 a year from now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning here I wanted to share is that &lt;strong&gt;for such capitals, considering the current gas costs, it will probably be better to stick to a position for months instead of trying to chase the best currently available yield&lt;/strong&gt;. Decent profits (~0.81 % /month) starts around the 3-months timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, remember Stani the farmer? You need to pick your crops wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;whales-playground---10-000&#34;&gt;Whale&amp;rsquo;s Playground (&amp;gt; $ 10 000)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if you have more skin in the game and are willing to take more exposure, gas costs become less prohibitive and there are more options available to you. I won&amp;rsquo;t expand on these, some pointers will be enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can leverage your Compound exposure to maximize your effective COMP mining (through supply/borrow). It obviously comes with a risk of liquidation. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dsa.instadapp.io/compound&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;InstaDapp&lt;/a&gt; helps you maximize COMP returns by folding your position up to 4x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, I&amp;rsquo;ve detailed a strategy built on the Synthetix platform which included another form of small leverage. It observed impressive returns (~200% effectively) since &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide/#5-a-the-synthetixcurve-yieldstack-aka-the-4-steaks-yieldburger&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduced 5 weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; - mostly due to a significant appreciation of the price of SNX, the largest exposure in this strategy and the very high level of activity on the Curve sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough prep - you are now an advised farmer - congrats! Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the tools used to plant your seed, secure your crops and harvest your yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-in-and-out-of-positions&#34;&gt;Getting in and out of positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get into liquidity pools “manually”, that is directly on each platform. It will require several transactions and a proportionate amount of a least two tokens, to begin with. If not, you will also have to swap accordingly beforehand, using a service like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. ParaSwap also helps you get into tokens like cDAI (interest-bearing DAI from Compound) from any other ERC20 with gas and price-efficient paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Balancer just add the option to enter a liquidity pool from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1276958110024896514?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;just one token&lt;/a&gt; (-&amp;gt; getting up to 8 tokens from 1, watch for slippage!).&lt;/em&gt; 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not the most familiar with Ethereum yet, the easiest way for you to partake in this feast would be to use tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-farmer-toolbox/zapper-fi.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting in and out of pools&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;: in the Invest tab, Zapper lets you conveniently get into/out of pools on Balancer, Curve, and Uniswap, from ETH, DAI and a few other tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying ETH &amp;amp; using DeFi services&lt;/strong&gt; like Aave (gas free on Aave for now!) - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://argent.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Argent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending ETH &amp;amp; stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt;. Now with ParaSwap built-in for swaps and soon an on-ramp to buy ETH/ERC-20 from your bank account!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, here’s a quick tip because I see this way too much.
&lt;strong&gt;You should never claim on Compound.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s costly and your COMP tokens are automatically claimed every time you adjust your position by depositing or withdrawing assets (minimal amount of COMP claimable required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-definancial-farmers-essential-toolbox&#34;&gt;The DeFinancial Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Essential Toolbox
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve explained  the basics dear organic farmers, it’s time to finally have a look at that promised toolbox. You&amp;rsquo;ll find below tools that help you track your positions and the markets &amp;amp; analyse the potential returns of strategies you think about applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of helping you zap in/out of pools, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an amazing all-in-one DeFi position tracker. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zapper.fi/synthetix?address=0x4E60bE84870FE6AE350B563A121042396Abe1eaF&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the Zapper of the wallet&lt;/a&gt; of the legendary farmer &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetix / Yearn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many pools and opportunities, it can be hard to keep track! Luckily, some really neat yield farmer tools are being developped. For Synthetix and Yearn.Finance especially, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarming.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yieldfarming.info&lt;/a&gt; is a neat ressource&lt;/strong&gt; to keep track of both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/JMB9bYfVUtMAPHM5moj7aIjLaDwos2k9JjJTtk64&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;overview of the COMP tokens mining &amp;amp; claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; here. Use this tool to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/compound/None&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;calculate the expected COMP returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; obtained by supplying or borrowing tokens on Compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Compound, you can estimate your BAL mining: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/balancer/%5B%5D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL Distribution Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you intend to use Balancer, I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend brushing up on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/striking-a-balancer-the-daily-gwei&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL token distribution early shenanigans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RealT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity mining returns are quite variable, so on the side you might want to consider tokenised real estate for more predictable returns with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://realt.co&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keeping-track-with-the-defi-news&#34;&gt;Keeping track with the DeFi news
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more on DeFi, here are a few resources I&amp;rsquo;d recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;The Daily Gwei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a short and sweet daily read on a key event/release
-&amp;amp; you can find me discussing DeFi every week with my friend Abel here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://abelsabstracts.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Abel Abstracts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s Gitcoin grant season so please indulge this closure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been in the space for a bit, hopefully even making some profits? How about sharing a small share back, let&amp;rsquo;s say 2 %, to critical infrastructure projects and to support your favourite DeFi services or content producers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contributions are immensely appreciated and can have a great impact, even for just 1 DAI thanks to the CLR matching. So if you liked this piece or my contributions to the DeFi space overall, feel free to have a look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/811/tokenbrice-shining-light-on-ethereums-defi-en-fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my Gitcoin grant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will help me fund more initiatives for the French community &amp;amp; help to go on with content production efforts like this one. Every contribution makes a difference, even 1 DAI (currently matched +5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are on Gitcoin with a grant in your basket, why not add more? Feel free to look around and support critical initiatives, from vulgarisation efforts to core research. Remember the gas struggles? You can &lt;strong&gt;donate to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/946/project-title-eip-1559-community-fund&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EIP 1559 Community Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to help on that front too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 10:53:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-make-definancial-products-work-for-you/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post 📖 How to make DeFinancial products work for you" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new economic paradigm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you landed here, you probably already have heard about Ethereum and even decentralised finance (DeFi). That&amp;rsquo;s great - today we take it to the next step: how to use DeFi to better your personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article walks you through 6 base strategies and their variants that harness the most relevant DeFinancial services. We start with the &amp;ldquo;set and forget&amp;rdquo; strategies and progressively move down the stack towards the more complex but also lucrative ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the strategies, I URGE you to read attentively the primer on gas below &amp;amp; as well as the disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is not investment advice. I am not an accredited investor or asset manager. I am just a 27 year old dude using DeFinancial services abundantly and highly active in the space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-primer-on-gas&#34;&gt;A primer on gas
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ If you know what gas is, feel free to ignore, else - please read this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All strategies described here are enabled thanks to decentralised finance services and executed on the Ethereum network. &lt;strong&gt;To interact with DeFi services, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for the commons of the Ethereum network - and that&amp;rsquo;s what gas costs are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas costs are paid in gwei, a subunit of ETH (1 gwei =  0.000000001 ETH). Most Ethereum wallets will suggest a default gas price. That&amp;rsquo;s usually enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as you dive deeper into the arcane of DeFi, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself coming back to gas to understand it better and optimise your transaction costs. Indeed, depending on the gas cost you pick (vs network observed one), your transaction will clear quickly, slowly, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethgasstation.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check recommended gas prices on ⛽ EthGasStation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;📑 EthHub Docs on Ethereum Transactions&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some strategies listed below (1, 3 &amp;amp; 4) are applicable without having to worry about gas, using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://argent.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re almost ready to go in! I just have some necessary disclaimers to share with you to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re on the same level &amp;amp; you understand the content presented below for what it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;necessary-reminders---please-read&#34;&gt;Necessary reminders - PLEASE READ
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All returns discussed in the articles are yearly APR (Annual Percentage Rate)&lt;/strong&gt; - to realise these APR (assuming the estimation is accurate), you need to hold your position for a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no objective measurements of complexity or risk&lt;/strong&gt; - the parameters I present you with while introducing a strategy are here for understanding only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; represent? A chance of losing your assets due to market events or your own shortcomings (usually stemming from a lack of understanding)  &lt;br&gt;
The &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; score gives you an idea of how technical and hard the risk is to understand and estimate.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please note: the risk of a failure at the Ethereum network-level is not equal to 0. I do not mention this risk again below - it&amp;rsquo;s implied as a base-level of risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no free lunches: be sensible with your decisions, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;quick rule of  thumb &amp;ldquo;the higher the APR, the higher the risk&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When markets go wild (either way), some products are affected more than others. While a sudden ETH price variation doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact RealT&amp;rsquo;s APR (2) - it can translate into significant losses for users of TokenSets or liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, keep in mind that most of the APR mentioned below change quite often. Don&amp;rsquo;t take them as such, especially if you read this piece weeks after its release: double check by yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering committing capital to a given project, &lt;strong&gt;I URGE YOU&lt;/strong&gt; to check the following ressources to learn more on their risk model &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.defiscore.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;passive-definancial-services&#34;&gt;PASSIVE DEFINANCIAL SERVICES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Products 1-4 are &amp;ldquo;set and forget&amp;rdquo; (please monitor your positions still). What&amp;rsquo;s meant is that entry is usually done through a simple purchase/swap - and so is the exit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in between the two, you have nothing to do to earn your yield - it&amp;rsquo;s paid to you without requiring any intervention (claim or other).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;with-stable-assets&#34;&gt;With Stable Assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some passive investment products involve only stablecoins - these are tokens tracking the price of a stable currency, usually the dollar. Considering the minimal amount of work required to use them, and the lower overall risk (mostly technical failure) these products are the best to get you started with decentralised finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-stablecoins-yield&#34;&gt;1/ Stablecoins Yield
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own an Ethereum-based asset tracking the price of the dollar (ex: DAI). You find a way for this asset to earn interest: lending (ex: aDAI) or liquidity providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1 = lowest, 5 = highest)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/1-stablecoin-yield.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;1-stablecoin-yield&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield-bearing stablecoins are the gateway drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can provide decent returns (up to 8-9% APR), are convenient to use and also not too complex so they are a good start to understand some fundamentals about DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting in and out is as easy as swapping a token. So, if while considering this approach, you only have three things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: base stablecoin risk (on DAI) + any service on top of it (ex: Aave for aDAI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return: there are some neat ressources to keep track with the yields, check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://loanscan.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LoanScan&lt;/a&gt; for instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas costs to get in &amp;amp; out (especially &lt;strong&gt;if you invest small amounts, or while the network is busy&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement this first strategy, you have several options: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://compound.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;, etc. You can acquire their corresponding tokens (cDAI, aDAI, iDAI) using a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of APR, historically, aDAI has been consistently topping the charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to expand on top of the base concept, you have several options offering better returns (meaning more risk):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-a-implementing-a-basic-stablecoin-yield-based-strategy&#34;&gt;1-A/ Implementing a basic stablecoin-yield based strategy
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECAP: You own an Ethereum-based asset dynamically rebalancing between several stablecoins providing yields to optimise your return.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, there are several services offering stablecoins providing returns thanks to lending pools. You can manually chase the best rate yourself, but will require you to monitor the rates and do the rebalances yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, why not use an Ethereum native service to do that for you in full transparency? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://idle.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Idle Finance&lt;/a&gt; is the leading solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-b-stablecoins-liquidity-providing-curve-pools&#34;&gt;1-B/ Stablecoins Liquidity Providing: Curve Pools
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own several Ethereum-based stablecoins and help facilitate trades on Curve (= liquidity provider). You earn a commission on each trade corresponding to the prorata of your share of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a dedicated section about liquidity pools below but I had to mention the Curve Pools here. In a gist, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve&lt;/a&gt; is a service made to optimize stablecoin swaps. Providing liquidity on Curve can be quite attractive since the base assets are all stablecoins &amp;amp; the returns provided by the commissions collected on the swaps (&amp;amp; lending) are decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-c--no-loss-lottery-pool-together&#34;&gt;1-C / No loss lottery: Pool Together
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lock a stablecoin (DAI or USDC) for a week or a month. They are pooled with other users&amp;rsquo; to generate interest (-&amp;gt;Compound). At the end of the week/month, the winner gets all the interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this one because it&amp;rsquo;s both surprising to see it here and amazing. So first, let me clear the air: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is not a financial product per-se - their vision is more pedagogic: PoolTogether is a money game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is quite simple, as described in the recap. Since all the profits of the winner are generated on the interests of all players, nobody loses any money with PoolTogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However please rest assured, the addition of PoolTogether in this list is not ideological: **average returns are superior to Compound. &lt;strong&gt;The reason why is quite simple: PoolTogether uses Compound to generate its return (= same APR) + each pool has some &amp;ldquo;sponsored&amp;rdquo; ticket - tickets contributing to the interest accrual, but without winning chances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/pt-sponsored.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pool-together-sponsored-balances&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the average APR is higher, please bear in mind that PoolTogether is much less regular - most of the time you&amp;rsquo;ll get nothing, but if you win you get the equivalent of years of interest on your capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoolTogether essentially provides a new flavor of interest distribution on top of Compound&amp;rsquo;s return: PT&amp;rsquo;s returns are much more random but also potentially massive (if lucky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/pooltogether/winning-more-prizes-185bad7f6d63&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether released the pods&lt;/a&gt; - a new option for users to play as a group. Users can now share their odds and their gains - which makes the wins less significant but much more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;You can play the PoolTogether lottery directly from their website.&lt;/a&gt; You&amp;rsquo;ll need some DAI or USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-tokenized-real-estate---realt&#34;&gt;2/ Tokenized Real Estate - RealT
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own shares of tokenized properties (securities). You earn your share of the rent daily (currently in USDC) + extra earning opportunities (liquidity providing, incentive programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/2-tokenised-real-estate.jpeg&#34;

    &gt;RealT&lt;/a&gt; is a totally different beast from anything else in that list, at several levels&lt;/strong&gt;. Since RealT tokens represents real estate in the real world, the risk profile is also totally different (~~&amp;gt;  less Ethereum risk, more real-word risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what makes RealT tokens so interesting, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure we are clear. &lt;strong&gt;RealT tokens are securities - you have to go through a KYC process to be able to purchase them&lt;/strong&gt; (whitelist + lease agreement).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more work than for interest-bearing stablecoins, but you have several benefits to gain here compared to strategy 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;: depending on the property, APR ranges from 8% to 12.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily payment of returns&lt;/strong&gt;: once you have some RealT tokens in your wallet, you will receive your corresponding** share of the rent, daily, in USDC**.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedging&lt;/strong&gt;: you have a yield based on real estate - AKA less correlated to the rest of the crypto markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;: you can add more to this strategy to increase the return. To do so, consider providing liquidity on Uniswap - generating some returns. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/realtplatform/announcing-the-uniswap-incentive-program-f82f721cf63a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Providing liquidity on RealT tokens is currently incentivised&lt;/a&gt; - landing even more returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-automated-trading-strategies---tokensets&#34;&gt;3/ Automated Trading Strategies - TokenSets
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own a &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; representing a stake in an automated trading strategy based on a technical indicator or another trader (social sets) a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Holding on autopilot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;TokenSets&lt;/a&gt; are the holders&amp;rsquo; best friend&lt;/strong&gt;. While the service is definitely not the easiest to understand or the less risky, it currently provides significant utility. Indeed, if you are a long term holder of ETH for instance, TokenSets is one of your best options to grow your ETH stash (against ETH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sets are automated trading strategies represented by a token. Each set trades a given pair (ex: ETH/cUSDC) following a pre-set of rebalancing rules triggered by the cross with the set technical indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;TokenViz&lt;/a&gt; provides a neat dashboard to help you chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a user who is not willing to look at charts all day, TokenSets is an excellent option. Indeed, most people trying to trade tend to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;With the sets, the emotions are out &amp;amp; machines rule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the regular sets following a technical indicator (such as ETH 20 Days Moving Average), there are now social sets. It&amp;rsquo;s the same mechanism, but your set will follow another&amp;rsquo;s trader strategy instead of simple technical indicators: aka &amp;ldquo;copy-trader&amp;rdquo; feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-simple-yields-to-chase-on-erc20-tokens&#34;&gt;4/ Simple yields to chase on ERC20 tokens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the ERC-20 version of strategy 1: you own an ERC-20 (non-stable) token producing some form of returns, usually through lending or liquidity providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/4-erc20-yields.jpeg&#34;

		alt=&#34;4-erc20-yields&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we explore the more active approaches, allow me to introduce one more passive approach, this time based on ERC20 tokens (not stablecoins.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Aave offers aTokens on up to 15 different ERC-20 tokens, it might be worth for you to keep an eye on them - with a tool like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aavewatch.now.sh/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AaveWatch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them, I think the following are the most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aSNX: base rate around 7%, can spike quite high for a bit - keep a very close eye to this one on Wednesdays, especially if prices of ETH/SNX crashed during the week: we observe SNX borrowing surges during certain claim periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asUSD: can spikes quite hard too, especially lately (~12% APR over the last month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aZRX: rates can spike, read more about ZRX to know when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aMANA: same here - decentish rate (1-2%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing nothing is amazing - and when it comes to investing it’s a strategy that can be surprisingly effective&lt;/strong&gt;. Being able to stand still and do nothing, even in the middle of a marketstorm is truly an art you would gain to master. However, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise for you: the best yield will require effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how I didn&amp;rsquo;t say work? Sometimes, the &amp;ldquo;efforts&amp;rdquo; can simply be that you accept to stomach a risk others wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and get paid nicely for it &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;the investor equivalent of a stunt double.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next strategies will require a more precise understanding of what you are doing. Indeed, at their core, all strategies would benefit immensely from your market acumen. So before we explore such strategies, allow me some reminders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information is power.&lt;/strong&gt; More specifically for DeFi investing: the information you have &amp;amp; understand is the main thing driving the alpha (returns) you&amp;rsquo;re extracting from the markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it slow, be safe, it&amp;rsquo;s not a race&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite writing this article (with many people advising), I have yet to use strategy 6 with serious amounts of capital for instance. It&amp;rsquo;s wise to double-check your understanding of a given platform every time you increase your stake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to quickstart the process? Go in with $50.&lt;/strong&gt; Small amounts are amazing to help you understand a protocol and be involved without taking too many risks and stressing about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-pointers-on-passive-vs-active-styles&#34;&gt;Some pointers on passive vs active styles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to give an accurate representation of the potential earning spread between an average DeFi passive investor and an active one. However, a combination of services reproduces a similar situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetix: SNX staking model to collateralise synthetic assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave + Synthetix = aSNX Passive (type 4) investment asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Expected Yearly Return &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Passive Style (aSNX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;None (once you own aSNX)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;~10%&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Active Style (SNX stake managed through mintr)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;Weekly claim of reward (1y escrowed) + sUSD + synths management strategy (trading, liquidity+staking)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;~80% &amp; more (up to you)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-synthetix&#34;&gt;5/ Synthetix
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with a stake of SNX (Synthetix token). You stake (lock) them which already generates a neat SNX return but vested for a year (+weekly sUSD non-vested). Thanks to your stake, you can then mint synthetic tokens - that expose yourself for up to 1/8 of the initial SNX value &amp;amp; offer additional earning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		alt=&#34;5-synthetix&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything else: what I say below is NOT ENOUGH to understand Synthetix+SNX if you are just discovering it. &lt;strong&gt;Do not rush it!&lt;/strong&gt; Synthetix is definitely a next step in terms of complexity, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of all the new things you will have to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a secured wallet - &lt;strong&gt;will you be able to access your wallet in a year?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
SNX rewards are escrowed a year: you claim them today, but you can only move them out of Mintr (Synthetix platform) a year after the claim date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim reward weekly&lt;/strong&gt; (SNX vested for a year + sUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; your collateralization ratio and adjust when need to be able to claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide&lt;/strong&gt; which Synth you&amp;rsquo;re exposing yourself to and when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Synthetix is really flexible, allow me to stick to a strategy I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully implemented. Other approaches are possible, and my choice is suggestive. However, I think this strategy does a good job at highlighting the different synergies available with Synthetix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;5-a-the-synthetixcurve-yieldstack-aka-the-4-steaks-yieldburger&#34;&gt;5-A/ The Synthetix/Curve YieldStack (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;the 4-steaks yieldburger&amp;rdquo;)
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use Synthetix (+SNX) to mint sUSD, a stablecoin, and supply this stablecoin to an incentivised liquidity pool for extra returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not beat around the bush: this is much harder, much more work than 1-4, but the returns are an order of magnitude higher if done right. Your position is also more complex to monitor since you are exposed to several types of assets, getting returns in several kinds of assets too, and the timeline of the returns are not the same either.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stake? Steak? Does it matter as long as there is meat on the bone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the base of the yield stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staking SNX + SNX reward&lt;/strong&gt; ~ 50% APR, in SNX, paid weekly (claim required) &amp;amp; vested for a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sUSD Staking reward&lt;/strong&gt; - variable sUSD reward (based on exchanges volume), paid weekly, claim required, no vesting period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Provider Curve sUSD pool&lt;/strong&gt; - 3 to 5% APR, earned while exiting the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentive Program&lt;/strong&gt; for that pool (accessed by staking the pool token)-  25% APR, in SNX, paid weekly (claim required), no vesting period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The Curve sUSD pool ran into some issues, and the current live version is not the most optimised one for returns. A new version of the sUSD pool is coming up, harnessing Aave to optimize it even farther. This strategy might get even more compelling as soon as this ships!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious ? Here is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://synthetix.community/docs/intro&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;comprehensive overview to get started with Synthetix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-liquidity-provider-not-on-stablecoins&#34;&gt;6/ Liquidity Provider (not on stablecoins)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use a capital equally split into to tokens (ex 50% ETH 50% DAI) to supply a liquidity pool, which generates commissions on the trade you help facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/6-liquidity-provider.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;6-liquidity-provider&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a riskier variant of the strategy 1-B. In this scenario, you are still providing liquidity but this time you move to another kind of pair - the ETH based ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you provide liquidity on a decentralised exchange, the main risk you face (on top of the usual) is what we call &amp;ldquo;impermanent losses&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. (confusing name, they are very permanent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t explain the full concept here, but here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap: &lt;strong&gt;impermanent losses usually stem from a sudden variation between the relative prices of the two assets you&amp;rsquo;re providing liquidity to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if the two assets are tracking the same price (ex ETH/sETH), the impermanent loss risk is minimized&lt;/strong&gt;. So, from the lower level of risk, to greater, you have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on stablecoins: both assets prices are relatively stable, and they track the same price =&amp;gt; the impermanent losses risk is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on assets that are not stable but tracking the same price, such as ETH/sETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on an ETH/stable pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on a ETH/ERC20 (both non stable &amp;amp; not tracking the same price) - this is where the risk is greater, since both assets can move - if both assets price were to suddenly move in opposite directions you can suffer significant impermanent losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are considering providing liquidity on AMMs, please read more on the topic: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Risk/Reward of liquidity provision in AMMs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/a-cold-look-at-decentralized-finance-mass-adoption-introducing-the-great-defi-filter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/great-defi-filter/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post A cold look at decentralized finance mass adoption: introducing the Great DeFi Filter" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the industry the question of adoption is so recurring it now almost triggers an automatic answer leading to a boilerplate response: &amp;ldquo;something about UX, something scalability&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, &amp;ldquo;something about privacy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as my usual, I&amp;rsquo;d like to bring to your attention a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-great-defi-filter&#34;&gt;The Great DeFi Filter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be a bit hard to hear for the bulls amongst us, but &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think DeFi is ready for mass audiences just yet&lt;/strong&gt;. From an outsider perspective, onboarding an Ethereum DApp is an exhausting adventure involving learnings in several disciplines and at least a basic understanding of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the numbers of steps and their complexity are reducing by day — the products are becoming more comfortable to use. However, &lt;strong&gt;usage is not the north star metric here: understanding is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still quite a steep learning curve before being able to use DeFi the smart way. &lt;strong&gt;This research and documentation phase is often too much work for most — this is the first layer of the filter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were an economic model, we would probably throw a &amp;ldquo;rational assumption&amp;rdquo; here and conclude that all users going past this point documented themselves and understand what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the real world, so let me give you a peek of mundanity: through my daily interactions, I run into some users interacting with services they do not understand. Most of the times, they haven&amp;rsquo;t committed too much, and their situation is salvageable, but sometimes the stakes are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;great-filter-or-great-safety-net&#34;&gt;Great Filter or Great Safety Net?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the filter better, we need to look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening in legacy finance. In the good old banking and finance industry, the learning curve is much less steep. Indeed, you usually have &lt;strong&gt;several intermediaries offering neatly packaged and easy to use products&lt;/strong&gt;: they abstract things for the user while the user of DeFi services is still doing a lot of the nitty-gritty work himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;these intermediaries also play their own game&lt;/strong&gt; - their goals can easily conflict with their users&amp;rsquo; best interest. For instance, if a banking service has its own saving-account product, it can become a form of incentive for them to mislead their users and push them towards it (instead of potential better options @competitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before we look at different options to lift the filter, I&amp;rsquo;ll close the loop with decentralised finance. The Great Filter I&amp;rsquo;m cornering is also a form of great safety net: everything is transparent and happening on-chain. After a bit of learning, anybody can read the same base data, process it, and be informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that the &lt;em&gt;Great Filter&lt;/em&gt; will only be lifted with a concerted effort from both sides: users of DeFi services and their builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lift-the-filter-by-championing-your-favourite-projects&#34;&gt;Lift the filter by championing your favourite projects
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more effort from the community - that&amp;rsquo;s you - to explain what is happening with all the different DeFi services. The amount of complexity involved is still massive, and we need more than ever content of the highest quality — videos, infographics, articles, you name it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, a &lt;strong&gt;high-quality DeFi post goes beyond just explaining: it sparks its readers&amp;rsquo; curiosity and leave them hungry for more&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want some help to get involved on this front,&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tokenbrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt; please reach out&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d be more than happy to give you some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m at it, let me address another recurring myth: &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t need to code to contribute to decentralized finance projects&lt;/strong&gt;. You can be delivering as much value, if not more, doing any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboarding family &amp;amp; friends: that&amp;rsquo;s quite obvious, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve found value in DeFi services, why could they not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you speak another language? Feel free to reach out to your favourite projects to help them translate their interface, support &amp;amp; other written content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can draw, on paper or digitally? Make a neat infographic of a system you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re the king of the opps? Get involved with your local meetups and help them organize!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got video or audio editing skills? You&amp;rsquo;re going to have many friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;builders-using-new-devices-to-solve-an-unprecedented-ux-challenge&#34;&gt;Builders: using new devices to solve an unprecedented UX challenge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I wrap this up, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the second side, the builders. UX of the Dapps is obviously a significant challenge - but why is that so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that as an industry, we&amp;rsquo;re still quite user-shy. We see again and again projects being developed in an Ivory Tower, and then unleashed to the crowds by their creators, full of hope &amp;amp; dreams - ready to be crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought the tech by itself was enough - insider tip: it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now accounting for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that we are building &lt;strong&gt;services operating in a manner never seen before&lt;/strong&gt;: transparent, interoperable, and more or less trustless thanks to decentralized or distributed networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only their operations are novel — these services are already delivering &lt;strong&gt;use cases that previously did not exist anywhere else&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are at the avant-garde and must try our best to make sure decentralized finance lives to our ideals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we should consider radically novel ways of approaching DeFi services design&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to bring all kind of perspectives, try weird and new stuff again and again until we crack the nut and figure out the tools most fitted to our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tkb-x-tkb-using-linguistics-to-improve-dapp-ux&#34;&gt;TkB x TkB: Using linguistics to improve dApp UX
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, at my level, I went back to my first loves: literature and linguistics and thought about how to use them to better the UX of a DeFi wallet. I did a quick trial run on the onboarding of the Monolith wallet — the results are insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find them here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TokenBrice/blog/blob/master/static/others/monolith-semantic-analysis.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;With ♥ love,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 12:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-fungibles” — don’t let yourself be fooled by the mushroom-evoking name, fungibility is an old concept that is finding a second wind nowadays. It’s mostly about collectibles and video games for now, but it will soon outgrow these industries. Indeed, the potential of non-fungibles tokens is much more significant than this: from official documents to titles of ownership, their use cases are diverse and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by establishing the basics about non-fungible tokens (NFTs from now on) thanks to Pokémon cards before we dive into their potential use cases and the future developments of the underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tokens-smart-contracts&#34;&gt;Tokens? Smart Contracts?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we explore NFTs and talk about Pokémons, let’s restate two definitions necessary to understand the rest of the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token&lt;/strong&gt;: a token represents a particular tradable asset or a utility that is often found on a blockchain. Each token has specific properties that are defined to match its usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-does-fungibility-evenmean&#34;&gt;SO, what does fungibility even mean?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fungible good is a good defined by its belonging to a type: different units of fungible goods are interchangeable. “Fungibility,” as a concept, is used in several different academic disciplines; we’re addressing the economic definition only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump to the examples which make the concept much easier to understand. Our modern currencies, such as the dollar, are fungible: one $5 bill can be exchanged with another. Gold is also a fungible good: 1 ounce of (pure) gold is worth another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fungible good is standardized: each unit of this good has no uniqueness, which is why we can exchange them with one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-non-fungible-goods-then-can-we-still-eatthem&#34;&gt;What about non-fungible goods then? Can we still eat them?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some goods are non-fungibles. They are goods which &lt;strong&gt;share common attributes but have their uniqueness&lt;/strong&gt;: each good has a unique set of values for each trait which is shared with the whole type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best example of non-fungible goods are… Pokemon cards of course! While we’re at it, let’s pick the one that used to be enough to crown you king of the playground: Charizard himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/charizard.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pokémon card is made of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name (and a level): Charizard, level 76,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Points (HP): 150,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A type: fire,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ability: Energy Burn,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attack and its cost: Fire Spin (4 fire energies),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness and Resistance: water and fighting,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retreat cost: 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Pokémon card is unique, but all follow this typology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider Blastoise for instance: he too has the 7 attributes we have already described, but he has different values for each which make him different from Charizard and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/blastoise.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the combination of the value for all the attributes that make the cards’ uniqueness. Hence, a card describing a fire type Pokémon with 150HP is not a Charizard — it is merely a card with 2 attributes equal to those of Charizard, out of 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokémon cards are useful because they make most of the concept of non-fungibility easy to grasp. &lt;strong&gt;NFTs are a category of tokens that share common attributes&lt;/strong&gt;. But each token has a set of unique values for these attributes which make the token itself unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were too young for Pokémon cards, or too old, it’s precisely the same principle for other card games: Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh !, World of Warcraft (the card game) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fungibility-applied-to-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Fungibility applied to cryptocurrencies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the cryptocurrencies you already know such as Bitcoin or Ethereum can be considered fungible (see below ⬇️). One BTC is worth another and two BTC can be exchanged with one another. It’s the same for all cryptocurrencies you could find on Coinmarketcap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the history of transactions of most cryptocurrencies can be checked on block explorers, some tokens involved in illicit activity are flagged and blocked on exchanges. Therefore, cryptocurrencies with public transaction histories are not truly fungible. Full fungibility is currently achieved by privacy-focused coins such as Monero, because the transaction history is not publicly disclosed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t address these today, as we focus on non-fungible tokens. There were several attempts, as early as 2013 to create NFTs, but they were mostly unsuccessful. What made a difference was a new Ethereum standard, the ERC-721 which greatly facilitated the creation of “cryptocollectibles.” They are unique goods which share common attributes — the blockchain equivalent of Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-humble-beginnings-powered-by-theerc-721&#34;&gt;The humble beginnings powered by the ERC-721
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptokitties.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cryptokitties&lt;/a&gt; is what made NFTs known to the general audience — they are virtual kittens which were the precursors of the ERC-721.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cryptokitties.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project went live in October and took a couple month to reach its peak of virality last December. Cryptokitties were such as success than the whole Ethereum network was clogged for several days by the flood of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/ck-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific kittens, the most desirable of the bunch, reached prices in the 5 digits ($) and changed hands several times in a few days early December. Considering the success of the CryptoKitties, the ERC-721 went through the due diligence to get approved and finalized last June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-fungible-tokens-in-the-everydaylife&#34;&gt;Non-fungible tokens in the everyday life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, collectible and video games are at the forefront of the innovation. Indeed, when it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the real-world applications of NFTs are very diverse, numerous, and much closer than we think. Thanks to their characteristics, NFTs can be an excellent support for the tokenization of real-life goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokenize means creating a token representing a good. The token by itself has no value; it draws its value from the good it represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenize-everything&#34;&gt;Tokenize everything!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization allows to handle goods like tokens which open a wide range of possibilities: exchange, P2P transferring, fractional ownership (0.x), etc. Besides, other features can be added depending on the tokenized goods: list of the previous owners, history of the value of the good, exhaustive list of the goods’ characteristics, limitations of ownership…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the benefits of tokenization are understood, we realize that tokenizing real goods will let us &lt;strong&gt;spare ourselves the need for greedy intermediaries while getting many exciting new features&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of real estate =&amp;gt; who need notaries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of pieces of art =&amp;gt; auctioneers and several other jobs would see their utility and even their existence challenged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of official documents (IDs for instance) =&amp;gt; a substantial cleanup in the actors and institutions currently involved in their emission, as well as those in charge of detecting and preventing frauds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three scenarios detailed above, checking the authenticity of these goods as well as making sure their owner is indeed the real owner of the good would be much easier than now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-disintermediation-thanks-to-tokenization&#34;&gt;The benefits of disintermediation thanks to tokenization
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization is much bigger than creating a token to represent a real-world good. Let’s come back to the definition of NFTs we proposed: “unique goods which share common attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tokenization would work as well for certificates. IDs, passports, report cards or even software license could be tokenized. Not only would it greatly facilitate the process of emitting and sharing them; it would also provide traceability, unlike anything we’ve ever known so far. Which in turns would make a 99.9% fraud detection and prevention goal a realistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we keep pushing the logic further, we could go back to the digital world and envision NFTs to store our digital identity. Our social network profiles could be open-source and easily exportable from one network to the others. Besides, it would give full control and ownership over our own data and prevent malicious third parties from stealing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get there, we need to &lt;strong&gt;overcome the current limitations of both the Ethereum network and non-fungible tokens&lt;/strong&gt;: as stated before, the CryptoKitties were enough to clog the whole Ethereum network for several days. The current state of the tech (or December’s state at least) is apparently insufficient for a large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ercsthe-new-standards-of-the-ethereumnetwork&#34;&gt;ERCs — The new standards of the Ethereum network
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Ethereum network, several teams are already working on the technical optimization of the network. Among them, we could mention Omisego/Plasma or the upcoming Ethereum update (Casper). Check the sources at the end of the article for resources on these matters; today we’re talking about NFTs so let’s get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-721 was a good start yet it faces many problems while going at scale. Before we get here, let’s zoom in on ERCs. An ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is a proposal submitted by an Ethereum developer. It introduces methods, behaviors, innovations or research that could be used to used to improve the network functionality. Once accepted, an ERC can become a standard — it’s quite a long process. Once again an example makes the concept much clearer: the most famous standard for Ethereum is the ERC-20. It described a fungible and straightforward token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The primary interest of ERCs is that they allow integrating the tokens within the ecosystem smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need to know the specifics of each token since they follow a set of methods shared with others (defined by the ERC). This is why a wallet which supports ERC-20 tokens support all of them without requiring particular development for each new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;erc-1155-the-future-of-non-fungible-tokens&#34;&gt;ERC-1155, the future of non-fungible tokens?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 is a new standard for NFTs proposed by Witek Radomski, the founder of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://enjincoin.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EnjinCoin&lt;/a&gt;, a platform made to facilitate the development of games with tokenized goods on the Ethereum network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 fixes many issues raised when trying to use NFTs based on the ERC-721 at scale, and also brings many new features. Regarding the technical optimization, the ERC-1155 allows sharing a given piece of code between several different tokens or collections of non-fungible tokens. It will enable to support a much higher volume of transactions for the same load on the Ethereum network (compared to the ERC-721).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
A transaction involving several fungible and non-fungible goods thanks to ERC-1155&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ERC-1155, it’s also possible to exchange several items in one single transaction. With ERC-721, if Bob wants to exchange its cryptokitties #1, #2, #3 and #4 for Alice’s Cryptokitty #5, it would require 5 different transactions while one would be enough using ERC-1155.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 also supports fungibles goods which are plenty in online games: think about all the coins, potions, arrows and other consumables. Using only one standard, the ERC-1155, versus a mix of them (ERC-721 for non-fungible goods and ERC-20 for fungible goods) makes it much easier for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, ERC-1155 could treat NFTs in a group, allowing them to retain some fungibility. It would allow players to differentiation the different iteration of a same common object, and the first owner of it could prove he was indeed the first to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible goods are taking off, and Ethereum is a the forefront of the innovation. To better understand the ramifications of this concept, it’s best to go check its current usages. Let’s have a look at some games being developed/already available in pre-release versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/godsunchained.png&#34;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://godsunchained.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gods Unchained&lt;/a&gt;: We used card games to introduce the concept, it’s only logical to find one here. Gods Unchained is among the most well-known one and uses the ERC-721 standard. The benefits compared to regular card games (such as Hearthstone) are numerous: immutability of the cards after the release (no more surprise nerfs), full transparency of the rarity of each type of cards, traceability of the previous owners of a given card… The team is focusing on eSports, and the first world championship will take place early 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decentraland.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt;: Take Minecraft, in virtual reality with blockchain-based mechanisms to handle ownerships: Welcome in today’s Tomorrowland! Once they own a piece of virtual land, users can create/develop the experience of their choosing (thanks to the SDK); they will then be able to control the access to their land and make other users pay for it if they want. Decentraland is a human and social experiment at world scale. It will be seriously insightful!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Augmentors&lt;/a&gt;: Since we were talking Pokémon earlier, what about Pokémon GO? Augmentors combined Augmented Reality with blockchain to offer a game where NFTs allow each user to truly own their augmented reality creatures and trade them as they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissing NFTs could be tempting as for now it could appear like something for kids and nerds. Yet, it’s precisely the opposite: as the CryptoKitties have demonstrated it, NFTs are one of the best Trojan horses to drive the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralization-based mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new technologies, the technical development is only the warming up phase. &lt;strong&gt;The real challenge lies with the social and legal acceptance of the tech: on that front, CryptoKitties and other collectibles are precursors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Awesome, welcome aboard! Before you jump in, let me give you some clues to spot shaky projects with examples taken from actual ones. These tips come from my experience (and failures) as well the discussion I had both with friends and the cryptocurrency community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-whitepaper-is-always-the-most-insightful-resource&#34;&gt;The Whitepaper is ALWAYS the most insightful resource
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitepapers (WP for the rest of this article) can be scary. While some manage to keep it short (~10 pages), others can reach the hundreds yet it’s the best place to gauge the seriousness of a project. &lt;strong&gt;It’s still the first thing I check once I’m seriously considering a coin&lt;/strong&gt;. So what should you be watching closely in a WP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-englishlanguage&#34;&gt;The English Language
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising? Not so much if you put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;how to trust an organization unable to put out a flawless WP with a decentralized cryptocurrency project?&lt;/strong&gt; It might seem small or even petty, but if you find a low-quality English or repeated typos in the WP, you better start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;big-promises-with-technical-vagueness&#34;&gt;Big Promises with technical vagueness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common, as most people won’t read the technical parts of the whitepaper. Even if you don’t fully get the technical details, the difference between a WP trying to cover its lies and a transparent one are quite apparent. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sficoin.co/white-paper/white-paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SFIcoin is the perfect example of this — DONT INVEST: SCAM&lt;/a&gt;, the full recipe is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big promises that don’t mean anything&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Next Global Paying System”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbacked claims&lt;/strong&gt;: their WP that details the vision, the roadmap, the use cases but doesn’t address AT all the tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, the SFICOIN is just going to be the first leading peer to peer cryptocurrency to manage the high-value instant payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We will be the first to X”&lt;/strong&gt;: massive red flag. There are no certainties in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A WP made by marketers for marketers&lt;/strong&gt; lot of visuals, a lot of work on design but overall it’s empty of real meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok for a WP to get quite technical (here is Stellar’s — XLM), but it’s not OK to cover an absence of technical solution with jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/stellar-wp.png&#34;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-darwin-awards-of-whitepapers&#34;&gt;The Darwin Awards of Whitepapers
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how does a terrible WP looks like? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://narbonne.io/Narbonne.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Check Narbonne’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been 7 months and I can’t find any worse. Out of the 22 pages, ~18 are spitting copy pasta about the future. Most of the paper is very generic, and so many things in it are so off. I had to pick one so here we go, the comparison between Narbonne, Ether&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;um and Wa&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;es. Yes, you read it right, they can’t even spell Ethereum and Waves properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things need to be debunked in this table, it’s actually a good exercise. Here are a few you do the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bookkeeping at the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;”: I’m not even sure what it means, but I think a project like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://request.network/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Request (REQ)&lt;/a&gt; covers this for Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Mobile Banking”: Hello &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omisego.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OmiseGo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“AI, chatbot, voice control”: strictly no use for the project (an infrastructure for banks) but buzzwords so they had to be here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-does-a-proper-wp-looklike&#34;&gt;How does a proper WP look like?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WP is a &lt;strong&gt;technical document&lt;/strong&gt; usually presenting at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vision for the project / what problem the team is trying to crack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the technical solutions proposed to the problem and why they were chosen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The details of the technical implementation of the chosen solutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credible roadmap for the delivery,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical information about the token: token type, total amount, token mechanisms…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifications for the ICO, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hone your skills, there is nothing better than the OG! I invite you to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Ethereum’s WP&lt;/a&gt; to remind you that &lt;strong&gt;the design doesn’t have to be fancy&lt;/strong&gt; (it’s a GitHub wiki) if the fundamentals are sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardano’s WPs: split between a “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/philosophy/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;academic papers&lt;/a&gt;, I think the team does an outstanding job to make their project intelligible to those interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transactions-per-secondmyth&#34;&gt;The Transactions per second myth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the whitepapers covered, let me address another big chunk of today’s article: the myth of the transactions per second (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;transaction-per-second-a-convenient-lie&#34;&gt;Transaction per second: A convenient lie
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPS doesn’t mean anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt; So why is it so popular? Well, it’s a bit like the GHz for processors: it used to be the only thing advertised. It makes sense in a way, &lt;strong&gt;it gives the impression&lt;/strong&gt; that you have a standard allowing you to compare different processors that are actually not comparable: higher is always better right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. You can have a 32 bit 1 core processor operating at 3.5 GHz and a 64 bits 8 cores processor operating at 2 GHz. Guess which one delivers the most computing power? It’s the second one without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the same for the tokens, except it’s not only the power that matters here. Let me pull &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-decentralization-matters-a-12-min-overview-for-the-layman-6ec572d35af6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a quick reminder from my previous article if you missed it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the TPS is meaningless, it’s almost expected now. Newcomer investors will put significant trust in this very misleading indicator, and most projects advertise a given TPS. Good! It gives you a good sign of how honest they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-tps-to-cut-through-thecrap&#34;&gt;Using TPS to cut through the crap
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider coin A, advertising 1M TPS and coin B advertising 10 TPS. What about the features they support? What about decentralization? What about the team vision? Community support? Simply by looking at the number, I know now that Coin A is bullshit and coin B could be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/nano.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;nano&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current state of the art of tech allows for a maximum of ~10 000 TPS (already huge) without excessive centralization.&lt;/strong&gt; Any coin promising something higher than this is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making compromise on decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@CryptoPeterG/eos-centralization-problem-bd7a392eeed2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The prime example of this EOS&lt;/a&gt; and its 21 block producers that have tremendous power over the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lab scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: you can see some coins advertising crazy TPS, some will even show a test network supporting their claim. The thing to look for is the setup of the test network: usually, it’s just a few nodes. It’s easy to reach a high TPS on a three nodes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets harder and harder as the nodes multiply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking on novel and previously untested technological solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nano.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NANO&lt;/a&gt; uses a new kind of ledger called block-lattice and supports up to 7 000 TPS in ideal conditions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.iota.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt; which uses another radically new solution (the Tangle) currently supports ~800 TPS, but it will scale with user adoption. Those two are the most radical “ledger innovations” there are and the most promising. They are the current state of the art: to me any project advertising TPS over this without an equally radically new technical solution is instantly suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including &lt;strong&gt;off-chain scaling&lt;/strong&gt; solutions in their computation of TPS, which leads back to point one: excessive centralization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including new mechanisms such as sharding&lt;/strong&gt; in their computation. Ethereum which has arguably one of the most robust dev community there is, is still 1 to 2 years away from a live implementation of sharding. How could a bunch of newcomers pull this in 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling this number out of their hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A cryptocurrency development project often starts quite centralized. What matters is that the team have a plan to open up the network progressively. For instance, NEO is quite centralized for now, but now that the infrastructure is sound&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://neo.org/blog/details/4089&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;the team is making moves towards decentralizing more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we conclude, let us dive into the crazy world of ICOs, it’s such a wild west that it deserves another section by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;icos-red-flags-to-lookfor&#34;&gt;ICOs red flags to look for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;huge-discounts-for-earlybirds&#34;&gt;Huge discounts for early birds
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see an ICO offering huge discounts (&amp;gt;30%) on the first phases of the sale that’s usually a recipe for disaster. Indeed, it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the early birds get such a large discount, they have a &lt;strong&gt;strong incentive to dump at ICO price or even a little below&lt;/strong&gt; once the token hit the market: it’s guaranteed free money if they sell fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should the team need such a strong incentive to drive the sale? I see this pattern a lot for &lt;strong&gt;tokens with close to no utility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the two situations above don’t unfold, one is guaranteed: huge discounts push towards a concentration of the tokens in the hand of a few: it attracts whales. Massive discounts are a recipe for &lt;strong&gt;political centralization and governance problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-product-demo-orcode&#34;&gt;No product, demo or code
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big risk with ICOs is that you’re essentially investing on a promise or a vision. Yet some ask for money once they already have a working alpha while some others run straight to the ICO as soon as the WP is ready. The latter is much riskier. If there is an alpha or a demo version available, please do check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a dev, &lt;strong&gt;it’s always insightful to check the GitHub repository of the project.&lt;/strong&gt; GitHub makes it easy to see how active the repository is, even without looking at the code. This method is far from perfect are there are ways to make it look like a repo is active even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-team-doesntmatch&#34;&gt;The team doesn’t match
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are seriously considering investing in an ICO, I urge you to google the most prominent team members. Look at their LinkedIn, their Twitter, their previous companies, etc. If you find inactive profiles, it’s usually a pretty bad sign. You might also find skeletons in the closest, such as one team member who participated in another crypto project that turned out to be a failure or a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Banano, a NANO fork&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low quality or frequency social media presence is also a bright orange flag. These guys will have to market their project, acquire users and partners. If they can’t market themselves, it’s already a shaky start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also very common for ICO scams to advertise a prestigious advisor… that has nothing to do with the project&lt;/strong&gt;. Double check any high profile figure to make sure they are actually involved in the project. If you see Satoshi as advisor, RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;inappropriate-token-distribution&#34;&gt;Inappropriate token distribution
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token distribution chart is usually present in every WP. If it’s not, it’s essentially like “give us your money, and we won’t tell you what we’ll do with it”… RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually looks like a pie chart. The most transparent projects have two: one for the distribution of the tokens, and one covering how the funds will be spent by team.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Storm token distribution is pretty good (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.stormtoken.com/token-structure-and-ceo-update-bd055860251e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok, even good that the team reserves a share of the token for the development of the project. You have to watch the share allocated to the team: it can range from 10% to 30% for the reasonable projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme of the spectrum, you have coins like Ripple (XRP) for which the team owns ~60% of the total supply. It is a significant risk for token holders: first, it’s an enormous vector of centralization. Besides, it means that &lt;strong&gt;the team can heavily manipulate the price of its coin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A few months ago, facing a backlash against this very centralized distribution, the team put an escrow system in place using a smart contract.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ripple.com/dev-blog/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;55 billions tokens are now placed in escrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and released at the pace of 1 billion per month. It doesn’t change anything to the underlying centralization issue and makes me wonder which kind of team would need $500 million (current price of XRP ~ $0.5) each month for its development/partnership/other. Besides,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;since these tokens are now locked they are not counted in the circulating supply (~39B)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which might reassure investors but is purely misleading. The actual supply is 100B tokens. Personal view: the whole move feels like a marketing stunt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article to provide you with some clues to help you spot unreliable crypto projects. Overall, I hope that you understand by now that &lt;strong&gt;the more you read before investing, the lower the risk will be&lt;/strong&gt;. I advise you NOT TO INVEST IMPULSIVELY. Even if it’s the best project in the world, you can sleep on it, read some more and decide a couple of days later with a fresh outlook if you want in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, let me give you more tricks I use to get a quick idea of the seriousness of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google search &lt;code&gt;site:reddit.com &amp;quot;token name (+scam/shitcoin/issues...)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;: this method allows you to search Reddit for a specific token. If there is a massive red flag on the project, it&amp;rsquo;s usually documented somewhere on Reddit. &lt;em&gt;Additional note: Reddit is getting quite tribal now. The best place to find reliable information on a given token is certainly not the token subreddit. Don&amp;rsquo;t go to /r/Ripple/ if you want an objective perspective on XRP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t trust one single source, always cross them!&lt;/strong&gt; Greedy people are promoting shaky projects all around the internet, never blindly trust just one guy even if he seems to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several services exist to organize the community due diligence on ICOs. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://icocheck.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ICOCheck&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty reliable one, but do your own due diligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: &lt;strong&gt;I strongly recommend you to not invest in ICOs for at least the first year you’ve been invested in cryptos&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of them fail dramatically. You are much better off limiting yourself to the top 25/100/200 tokens depending on the risk you’re willing to take. Even among those, there are many doubtful projects: beware and happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;
