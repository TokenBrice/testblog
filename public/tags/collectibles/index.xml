        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Long live to free and on-chain auditable wrestling" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is going to be more personal than usual, but given the subject I can&amp;rsquo;t do otherwise. We&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on an NFT project in which I&amp;rsquo;m strongly involved: the Luchadores. They are fully onchain wrestlers, soon to be characters in an upcoming game, also onchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than the project itself, I will explain the thesis I am developing about it. I think this approach may interest you and help you develop personal beliefs about other collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t detail the mechanics of the Luchadores or the upcoming game. Feel free to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://whitepaper.luchadores.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the whitepaper now available&lt;/a&gt; for more info on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-thesis-on-the-luchadores&#34;&gt;📑 My thesis on the Luchadores
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not yet well informed about NFTs and my activities in this area, feel free to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/nft/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduction page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four main reasons for my interest in the Luchadores and my enthusiasm for this collection, so let&amp;rsquo;s get right to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-an-innovative-and-inclusive-generation-process&#34;&gt;🔮 An innovative and inclusive generation process
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generation of the Luchadores was a fully onchain process thanks to the use of Chainlink&amp;rsquo;s VRF. It allows to &lt;strong&gt;generate random numbers in a verifiable way&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to this feature, the minting of a Luchadores was done with the guarantee that there were no possible manipulations, and the proof of the calculation remains available for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this innovative technical dimension that helped me spot the project initially. Limited to &lt;strong&gt;10,000 Luchadores in total&lt;/strong&gt;, the mint remained available for about &lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; (March-&amp;gt;June 2021), with some excitement in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long minting period allowed everyone who wanted to be involved to do so, with plenty of time to achieve more timely transaction costs if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation was done at the price of 2 LINK (fee needed for the VRF mechanism), paid in ETH + gas costs. Depending on the LINK price and the transaction costs on the network, miners paid between 0.015 and 0.025 ETH per Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verifiable random generation has given rise to some rather amusing &amp;ldquo;trivia&amp;rdquo; facts about the Luchadores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-distribution.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-distribution&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of rarity is a normal curve: there are more than 8000 Luchadores (81.3%) in the group of 3, 2 or 4 attributes, the most common. The closer we get to the extremes, the rarer the Luchadores become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Common (3*, 2*, 4*)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Rare (1*, 5*)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Epic (6*, 0*)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Legendary (7*)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generated numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8130&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1654&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;205&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;81.30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16.54%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2.05%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;0.11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could have been a Luchador with 8 attributes, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. There would most likely have been only one: no Lucha god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the attribute &amp;ldquo;mustache&amp;rdquo; falls on a Luchador whose skin color is very close to the one used for the mustache, creating a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://luchadores.io/luchador/8085&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hidden mustache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These Luchadores are given special attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-hidden_mustache_difference&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-onchain-approach&#34;&gt;⛓ The onchain approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the generation done entirely onchain, the visual of the Luchadores is in an optimized format (svg) that allows &lt;strong&gt;storage directly on the Ethereum chain&lt;/strong&gt;, thus bringing a consequent resilience to the media associated to each NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there since the upcoming game, which we discuss next, will also rely on &lt;strong&gt;verifiable random generation mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. So in the arena, critical hits or dodges will be the result of verifiable randomness and very hard to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/AFA-score.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-art-for-all&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one to notice this very resilient approach, which also appealed to the Link marines. Luchadores is also the only 100/100 project with Avastars on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://artforall.io/score?search=&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ArtForAll, a service that evaluates the resilience of NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, one could describe the project as &amp;ldquo;on chain maximalist&amp;rdquo; but it is not the case: compromises, unfortunately necessary, are envisaged at the level where it is possible to afford it: the random draws related to the game, will be realized on a sidechain (Polygon) or a rollup. This will allow &lt;strong&gt;to keep the game accessible and inexpensive&lt;/strong&gt;, while taking advantage of maximum guarantees for the NFT, which is always warm on the Ethereum chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-luchadores--the-game&#34;&gt;🎮 Luchadores : The Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game itself probably resonates with my nostalgic side. Indeed, the fight will be &lt;strong&gt;turn by turn&lt;/strong&gt;, with a system of attributes (stats), passive skills and triggered skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-stats.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you read up on the impact of attributes and skills, but as a fan of turn-based games, strategies and RPGs, I can tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m ready for theorycraft 🧙&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An associated token&lt;/strong&gt; (LUCHA) will be available to be won. It will also be distributed in the first year to NFT Luchadores owners. The token will have several forms of use related to the game (respect, prodigy system, rename?) and can also be &lt;strong&gt;staked to earn MASK&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-transferable token (only in-game) useful to equip your Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-community-and-its-history&#34;&gt;📜 The community and its history
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is developed by a single person, Luchador, who was gradually joined by several profiles needed for the development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the beginning, community members emerged like Teh_Griz and LuchaBroy: they became the first moderators of the Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got progressively involved, to help make the project known, to develop the French-speaking community and to bring my help where it is relevant, more info later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A game designer and two pixel artists (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/AbueloRetroWave/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AbueloRetroWave&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/m3r0j&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;m3r0j&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking here only about &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; implications. Of course, we must not forget all the community initiatives. It is impossible to list them all here, but I will mention them anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicosz who created a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/sznicolas/luchadata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tool in Python to analyze data related to Luchadores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/lokhidor/Luchadores&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;dashboard to track key metrics on Luchadores&lt;/a&gt;, offered by cnhkp.eth, using Dune Analytics and thanks to Nicosz&amp;rsquo; help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or OxMule which has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://whitepaper.luchadores.io/v/francais/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;translated the whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without forgetting the many collectors and &amp;ldquo;snipers&amp;rdquo; of the Discord who animate it every day, like Chainlinkers, one of the first members of the community who won two giveaways in a row on his birthday and became a legend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-involvement&#34;&gt;🐒 My involvement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered the Luchadores in May, I minted about 80 of them and I followed the project quite passively at the beginning. In June, when the craze started to be more palpable, I got more actively involved, first as a moderator for the French community and then as an administrator of the Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see my involvement in the project as an opportunity to educate about the technical dimensions of NFTs. I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose this project at random: I think that the SVG onchain approach used by the Luchadores is among the most credible, despite the graphical compromise (-&amp;gt; pixel style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, I animate the community with different giveaways and I help to make the Luchadores known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-my-luchadores&#34;&gt;🃏 My Luchadores
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty unlucky at minting my Luchadores, so I&amp;rsquo;ve made up for my luck with my acquisitions. Although most of them are a mechanical cleaning of the floor price, mostly between 0.025 and 0.035 ETH, I also acquired some rarer Luchadores including three 7 attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best catch is the &amp;ldquo;Batman&amp;rdquo;, a &amp;ldquo;7 attributes&amp;rdquo; that will be one of my main fighters in the arena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-lucha-7-attributes-8956&#34;&gt;⭐ Lucha 7 attributes #8956
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-8956.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-8956&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in possession of 3 Luchadores 7 attributes, &lt;strong&gt;I wish to put one back into play&lt;/strong&gt;. This one will not go to the highest bidder&amp;hellip; no way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://luchadores.io/luchador/8956&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Luchador #8956&lt;/a&gt; will be won in the arena&lt;/strong&gt;, so it will go to the most skilled player. Looking forward to sharing more details about the allocation mechanism when the game is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-giveaways&#34;&gt;🎁 Giveaways
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have minted about 80 Luchadores, and bought over 150 on OpenSea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to use a good part of it as a &amp;ldquo;promotional budget&amp;rdquo; for the Luchadores - and it is already done. Several distributions have taken place and a good 50 have already been given away, including 25 to the top wheat farmer DeFi France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest, as I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the skin-in-the-game concept (direct involvement with consequences), and given my involvement in the project I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it any other way. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any Luchadores in my possession on other wallets, I centralize everything on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opensea.io/tokenbrice?search[sortBy]=LISTING_DATE&amp;amp;search[query]=luchadores&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my ENS by transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luchadores first traded near the cost of minting, before establishing a second floor around 0.03 ETH. Since the end of September, with the arrival of the whitepaper, the craze is palpable and is reflected on the floor (price) now around 0.07 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a wrestler&amp;hellip; great, but at what price? Don&amp;rsquo;t expect a direct answer from me on that. At this point in time and at this stage of development, it is still a gamble. Nevertheless, the approach is relevant and I think that Luchadores has the potential to enter the NFTs canon, pushing the frontier of interactivity made possible with these digital objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a Luchadores today means paying about three times minimum the price seen a few weeks ago - and yet it would be a good deal if the current trend continues 🔮 welcome to the world of NFTs, where pricing is a social and highly reflective mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now place your bets, &amp;ldquo;rien ne va plus&amp;rdquo; 🎲.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;

Those who follow me live or on Twitter heard about the project in May and could read about it directly, if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you understand what it is about a collection of wrestlers that fascinates me, and more generally how I analyze a collection, and that it will also help you evaluate others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/88DeLo.png" alt="Featured image of post Non-fungible tokens (NFTs): the weight and contribution of ascertainable history " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible tokens are attracting a lot of attention lately. On the one hand, the general public is scratching its head about the ever-rising records observed on flagship sales, now covered in the mainstream press&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, artists still not initiated to blockchains realize the potential offered by &lt;strong&gt;disintermediation&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the possibilities offered by &lt;strong&gt;the programmable nature of this new art form&lt;/strong&gt;. In between, a diverse audience ranging from the casual collector to the seasoned speculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: NFTs leave no one indifferent. Indeed, by &lt;strong&gt;combining the logic of provable digital scarcity with art&lt;/strong&gt;, NFTs allow to explore new forms of expression. Moreover, the programmable dimension of NFTs opens the way to a barely begun exploration of new forms of interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to leave theory aside as much as possible and focus on &lt;strong&gt;the practical uses observed with these NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt; We will therefore analyze two fundamental characteristics of NFTs - &lt;strong&gt;their community dimension&lt;/strong&gt; and their &lt;strong&gt;ability to become social markers&lt;/strong&gt;. Once these two dimensions are established, we can consider different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

They are extremely relevant for community-based uses or in video games but &lt;strong&gt;NFTs offer much more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example in DeFi, an inter-asset exchange on Curve involves a &amp;ldquo;receipt&amp;rdquo; NFT and more recently Uniswap is considering NFT tokens to represent liquidity provider positions (and their many parameters) for V3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these different uses of &amp;ldquo;NFT technology&amp;rdquo; are relevant. However, we are going to focus on the artistic and community uses of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-community-dimension-of-nfts&#34;&gt;The community dimension of NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand collectibles and NFTs, I think it is essential to understand their community and social dimension. From a community point of view, the simple possession of an NFT can be enough to show a belonging to a given group, like the CryptoPunks for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that at a primordial level NFTs are a direct response to a very human tendency: &lt;strong&gt;we are all collectors&lt;/strong&gt;, in one way or another. Items usually collected require &lt;strong&gt;trust in the issuer to be certain of rarity&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. Pokemon card). NFTs allow assets with provable numerical rarity, which completely changes the parameters of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henceforth, &lt;strong&gt;each work of art can become famous and its entire history is accessible to all and tamper-proof&lt;/strong&gt;. Where in classical art, only the history of the most famous pieces is told (by secondary sources), with NFTs each piece get the same treatment: its creation as well as each purchase or transfer are recorded on a public blockchain. They can be consulted (and verified) by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-weight-of-ascertainable-history&#34;&gt;The weight of ascertainable history
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story behind a work of art has always been an integral part of it. But with its incorporation directly into the object, without intermediation and therefore without the need to have a third person to tell it, we go to a much more interesting level. My views are still young on the subject, but I am convinced that &lt;strong&gt;with this new tamper-proof interface to access the history of the object, comes a revaluation of it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m testing this hypothesis with a artwork of which I write part of the history, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:111850&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the famous DeLorean 88MPH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. By acquiring a quarter of the circulating total, that is progressively distributed to DeFi France / TokenBrice contributors, I simultaneously articulate these two overarching theses about NFTs: this iconic car becomes both a community tool and a social marker. It shows the belonging to a group, while allowing to prove one&amp;rsquo;s involvement in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too early to draw conclusions from this experiment but nevertheless the first results are encouraging: out of the 22 DeLos, 8 have been distributed. The best buyback offer is currently at 0.15 ETH, which is about 3x the initial purchase price (88 DAI) but none of the 8 people who received this NFT gave in. The Delo is still being traded though: one of them was just sold for 0.5 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For them, some of them at least, this NFT also has &lt;strong&gt;a very personal story&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, it was the first digital object of its kind owned by several of the winners and the context of its acquisition quickly makes it a symbol: it was earned trough their hard work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not give resale instructions for NFT donations. I encourage the winners to keep the NFT if they like it, but &lt;strong&gt;also point out sale opportunities that exist at the time of donation if they wish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nfts-as-a-social-marker--crytopunks-analyses-&#34;&gt;NFTs as a social marker : CrytoPunks analyses !
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the NFTs&amp;rsquo;s social aspect, together with their ability to incorporate and verify their own storyline, another feature emerged : they can be used as a social distinction. Using CryptoPunks to make this point is quite suitable in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/punk-variety-2x.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were among the first NFTs collection projects. The originality lies in their unique charateristics : No two Punks are alike as they have been generated algorithmically with some traits rarer than others. In this way some Punks have become almost legendary as well as their prices !&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time goes by, CryptoPunks have established themselves as the symbol of something way greater than just NFTs. It is now the most traded NFTs collection on the market with a floor price that lies around 17 ETH :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/punk-stats.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Cryptopunk-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-recognize-the-scarcity-&#34;&gt;How to recognize the scarcity ?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing and being able to recognize the Punks attributes is a high-valuated skill to be part of the community. There is a total of 10,000 Punks. Indeed, each Punks have their own profile page showing their type (human, Zombie, Ape or Alien) and their different traits, from absolutely none to a maximum of 7 for the most unique of them : only one Punk gathers as much !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that more is best : the demand for Punks without any attribute is really strong due to the very low supply : only 8 in total !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there are only 333 Punks (/10 000) with 1 trait, which also makes them quite rare and wanted. Similarly, Punks with 5 (166 units) or 6 attributes (11 units) are also uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest part of the collection is made up with &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; Punks, with 2 ( 3560 units ), 3 ( 4501 units ) or 4 attributes ( 1420 units ) : these Punks represent almost 95% of the total supply.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punks are now at the center of a whole ecosystem : from technical integrations (with the ERC-721 wrapper for example or into NFTs indexes&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to the artistic field such as the PicassoPunk :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as exhibiting well-chosen modern art in a living room gives a special aura, &lt;strong&gt;displaying your Punk becomes a symbol that goes far beyond the token itself.&lt;/strong&gt; It may now be in good taste to use a Punk from your collection as a profile picture on Twitter. Of course, the more unique and rare it is, the more intrigued the savvy audience will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of CryptoPunks allows us to understand many fundamental things to assimilate the use of NFTs. Nevertheless, the use cases for NFTs are much more diversified. So I suggest you explore a few more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-main-use-cases-of-nfts&#34;&gt;The main use cases of NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;creation-and-sales-services&#34;&gt;Creation and sales services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to acquire your first NFTs is still to buy them. This is &lt;strong&gt;far from being the only method,&lt;/strong&gt; as we will see below, but before that, let&amp;rsquo;s have a quick look at &lt;strong&gt;the main platforms and their modalities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used site is probably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opensea.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;, which allows direct sales or auctions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt; is another easily accessible and potentially more optimized option for creators to emerge. It is sometimes described as &lt;strong&gt;the &amp;ldquo;Etsy&amp;rdquo; of NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services exist, with more curatorial approaches, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://foundation.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;strong&gt;selective about its artists and where each work is a unique copy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each service comes with different modalities and sometimes different NFT types as well: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ERC-721 or 1155 explained here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The rules that govern their auctions and revenue sharing also affect the overall direction of the platform. To start collecting with taste, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know at least what you&amp;rsquo;re buying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nfts--video-games-in-all-forms&#34;&gt;NFTs + Video games, in all forms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious use cases for NFTs is of course video games. Almost everyone understands this immediately once the issue of provable digital scarcity is well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-new-level-of-persistence&#34;&gt;A new level of persistence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without NFT, a player can find himself fighting for days in an online game to get an item&amp;hellip; that is not actualy his. It is sometimes so repetitive that the term &amp;ldquo;farming&amp;rdquo; is also used by players to describe their practice (a slightly different meaning from the DeFians&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;farming&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/meuporg.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;meuporg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game services may stop for example (if it is an online game) and often the player cannot exchange his item freely. Incorporating NFTs in video games allows &lt;strong&gt;the existence of a persistence that is not dependent of the game editor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence, as every gamer and every DeFian understands, is in a way the soul of an online game. However, this is only the most fundamental level of the potential contribution of NFTs to video games. They also allow a whole set of additional logic thanks to their &lt;strong&gt;programmable dimension,&lt;/strong&gt; among others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories that are truly co-written by players and can be remembered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items that can exist in multiple games, even potentially with a story that feeds from the different universes where the item is involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Famous players who leave a real mark in the game, far beyond a boss or place named after them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some NFT standards, such as 1155, go further and allow the existence of attributes that evolve on different tokens. They allow to consider a new form of persistence where &lt;strong&gt;the player&amp;rsquo;s actions would potentially translate into concrete actions (on-chain) taken for the organization (the DAO) master of the game(s) involved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-contribution-of-a-marketplace-in-digital-worlds&#34;&gt;The contribution of a marketplace in digital worlds
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proven digital scarcity has been a key issue since the beginning of the first persistent online worlds. All games that have a large audience also have a developed and successful &amp;ldquo;black market&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;each digital world its bazaar paid in real money&lt;/strong&gt;: for example in World of Warcraft, a simple google search allows you to buy gold or various other services to accelerate the progression of your character thanks to a secondary market of service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having an object, potentially created by the game publisher but not dependent on it for its concrete existence, is absolutely new&lt;/strong&gt;. This does not mean, of course, that every object in every game will have a second and third existence, but it is now a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you could deploy your own Charizard - the one that&amp;rsquo;s been sleeping in your GameBoy for over 15 years - in a Pokemon arena in virtual reality. It would become a digital object, represented by an NFT and incorporating all your history with it, making it also, in effect, unique. Each battle or tournament could leave traces on the NFT-object, such as a temporary weakening or learning new abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a primitive vision of the &amp;ldquo;endgame&amp;rdquo; that I foresee, at the crossroads of video games, NFTs and virtual reality. &lt;strong&gt;There is already a concept to describe this new reality that is taking shape : the Metaverse&lt;/strong&gt;. These are persistent virtual worlds composed among others of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;farming-nfts--nft--defi&#34;&gt;Farming NFTs ? NFT + DeFi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If NFTs are coming to games, the reverse is also true: games and NFTs are also coming into DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started very simply, with an approach that every DeFian knows well: &lt;strong&gt;This is the concept of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://dontbuymeme.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Meme&lt;/a&gt;, where the user stakes MEME tokens to obtain points (pineapples) used to obtain the desired NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no other fees than gas costs of the various operations and potentially a minting fee paid in ETH for some coins. Even so, many coins are highly desirable and wanted on the secondary market.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meme is now several months old and has become a service that has managed to surpass its own token. Collaborations with different artists are frequent to propose new collections, but &lt;strong&gt;also directly with projects&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Meme was used to support a game with BadgerDAO. By depositing bBADGER or UNIv2 BADGER/wBTC tokens, users could farm 6 different NFTs related to the project universe. The first player to assemble all 6 different NFTs was able to open a smart contract and receive a nice amount of BADGER tokens as a bonus. &lt;strong&gt;In addition, the possession of these NFTs served as a bonus factor on the distribution (airdrop) of the DIGG token.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://badgerdao.medium.com/badger-x-meme-nft-honeypot-part-ii-diamond-hands-7111d38b5df4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;second part of the Badger NFT game&lt;/a&gt; has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services use Meme with a similar approach : the YOP platform proposes to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dontbuymeme.com/collections/yop&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;farm &amp;ldquo;tickets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of different rarities. They will potentially allow &lt;strong&gt;access before the general public, once the service is available.&lt;/strong&gt; Here we find the community dimension of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;88MPH is doing something similar &lt;strong&gt;by offering NFTs to the biggest users of its new products a few weeks after their launch&lt;/strong&gt;. Holding such an NFT would also be an excellent criterion to target the most relevant users to test the new versions and participate more actively in the development of the project (purely an illustration on my part, there has been no official announcement in this sense to my knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-infinity-and-beyond-&#34;&gt;To infinity, and beyond !
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article we have mainly developed few analyses that demonstrate possibilities offered by NFTs. Finally, I will give you a brief overview of what&amp;rsquo;s left to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, I had the opportunity to talk with an artist who explores a universe that could be described as &amp;ldquo;role playing with NFTs&amp;rdquo;.  Arke, for example, offers &lt;strong&gt;an innovative collection that is animated with Legends of Cryptonia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside for the usual characters, some have been poisoned, others have specific status and the story of Cryptonia is still being written every day.  The first &amp;ldquo;creature&amp;rdquo; is now available for sale and unlocks access to multiple poisoned characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities offered by NFTs, thanks to their programmable structure, are actually infinite. Before concluding, let&amp;rsquo;s consider few other use cases not yet covered in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are also used as commemorative badges to remember and show presence at a particular event. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.poap.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;POAP project&lt;/a&gt; allows for example to create &amp;ldquo;proofs of attendance&amp;rdquo; for an event with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community membership could also be directly represented by a scalable NFT&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow, among other things, to record the common history by saving each of the on-chain actions of all its members. This use case is obviously unrealistic today with the gas costs of the mainnet, but possible on L2 or sidechain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget also that I have focused this article on the community and artistic uses of NFTs. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention what NFTs can allow in terms of intellectual property or even physical goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, NFTs have the potential to become &lt;strong&gt;a new type of &amp;ldquo;universal dictionary &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt; allowing to represent and define any object but especially family or category of objects &lt;strong&gt;in a reliable and on-chain way&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows the &amp;ldquo;tokenization&amp;rdquo; of what was not tokenizable in the past (non-fungible goods). With tokenization comes a whole set of options - as seasoned DeFians know well and others will soon discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;strong&gt;the use cases of NFTs are still very primitive&lt;/strong&gt;, due to their main limitation: &lt;strong&gt;very expensive gas costs to create, manipulate and interact with&lt;/strong&gt;. I think that the essential dimension of NFTs in the organization of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s digital world will become even more obvious with the democratization of NFTs that the development of various sidechains and Layer 2 will allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;censorship-of-media-associated-with-nfts&#34;&gt;Censorship of media associated with NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I did not address a key point about NFTs: &lt;strong&gt;the persistence of their associated media&lt;/strong&gt;. To be truly persistent and censorship resistant, the NFT must incorporate a direct reference to the associated media file, which is itself hosted using a resilient medium like IPFS. For more details on the issue, I refer you to this clear and detailed discussion on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this introduction and learned something new. NFTs have been a topic of interest for me for a long time that I renewed recently. Besides my research on DeFi, I also intend to share my experience with NFTs on this blog. My last article on the subject was written more than three years ago, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time I took up the pen again!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 12:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-fungibles” — don’t let yourself be fooled by the mushroom-evoking name, fungibility is an old concept that is finding a second wind nowadays. It’s mostly about collectibles and video games for now, but it will soon outgrow these industries. Indeed, the potential of non-fungibles tokens is much more significant than this: from official documents to titles of ownership, their use cases are diverse and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by establishing the basics about non-fungible tokens (NFTs from now on) thanks to Pokémon cards before we dive into their potential use cases and the future developments of the underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tokens-smart-contracts&#34;&gt;Tokens? Smart Contracts?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we explore NFTs and talk about Pokémons, let’s restate two definitions necessary to understand the rest of the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token&lt;/strong&gt;: a token represents a particular tradable asset or a utility that is often found on a blockchain. Each token has specific properties that are defined to match its usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-does-fungibility-evenmean&#34;&gt;SO, what does fungibility even mean?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fungible good is a good defined by its belonging to a type: different units of fungible goods are interchangeable. “Fungibility,” as a concept, is used in several different academic disciplines; we’re addressing the economic definition only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump to the examples which make the concept much easier to understand. Our modern currencies, such as the dollar, are fungible: one $5 bill can be exchanged with another. Gold is also a fungible good: 1 ounce of (pure) gold is worth another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fungible good is standardized: each unit of this good has no uniqueness, which is why we can exchange them with one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-non-fungible-goods-then-can-we-still-eatthem&#34;&gt;What about non-fungible goods then? Can we still eat them?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some goods are non-fungibles. They are goods which &lt;strong&gt;share common attributes but have their uniqueness&lt;/strong&gt;: each good has a unique set of values for each trait which is shared with the whole type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best example of non-fungible goods are… Pokemon cards of course! While we’re at it, let’s pick the one that used to be enough to crown you king of the playground: Charizard himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/charizard.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pokémon card is made of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name (and a level): Charizard, level 76,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Points (HP): 150,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A type: fire,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ability: Energy Burn,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attack and its cost: Fire Spin (4 fire energies),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness and Resistance: water and fighting,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retreat cost: 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Pokémon card is unique, but all follow this typology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider Blastoise for instance: he too has the 7 attributes we have already described, but he has different values for each which make him different from Charizard and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/blastoise.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the combination of the value for all the attributes that make the cards’ uniqueness. Hence, a card describing a fire type Pokémon with 150HP is not a Charizard — it is merely a card with 2 attributes equal to those of Charizard, out of 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokémon cards are useful because they make most of the concept of non-fungibility easy to grasp. &lt;strong&gt;NFTs are a category of tokens that share common attributes&lt;/strong&gt;. But each token has a set of unique values for these attributes which make the token itself unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were too young for Pokémon cards, or too old, it’s precisely the same principle for other card games: Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh !, World of Warcraft (the card game) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fungibility-applied-to-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Fungibility applied to cryptocurrencies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the cryptocurrencies you already know such as Bitcoin or Ethereum can be considered fungible (see below ⬇️). One BTC is worth another and two BTC can be exchanged with one another. It’s the same for all cryptocurrencies you could find on Coinmarketcap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the history of transactions of most cryptocurrencies can be checked on block explorers, some tokens involved in illicit activity are flagged and blocked on exchanges. Therefore, cryptocurrencies with public transaction histories are not truly fungible. Full fungibility is currently achieved by privacy-focused coins such as Monero, because the transaction history is not publicly disclosed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t address these today, as we focus on non-fungible tokens. There were several attempts, as early as 2013 to create NFTs, but they were mostly unsuccessful. What made a difference was a new Ethereum standard, the ERC-721 which greatly facilitated the creation of “cryptocollectibles.” They are unique goods which share common attributes — the blockchain equivalent of Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-humble-beginnings-powered-by-theerc-721&#34;&gt;The humble beginnings powered by the ERC-721
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptokitties.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cryptokitties&lt;/a&gt; is what made NFTs known to the general audience — they are virtual kittens which were the precursors of the ERC-721.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cryptokitties.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project went live in October and took a couple month to reach its peak of virality last December. Cryptokitties were such as success than the whole Ethereum network was clogged for several days by the flood of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/ck-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific kittens, the most desirable of the bunch, reached prices in the 5 digits ($) and changed hands several times in a few days early December. Considering the success of the CryptoKitties, the ERC-721 went through the due diligence to get approved and finalized last June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-fungible-tokens-in-the-everydaylife&#34;&gt;Non-fungible tokens in the everyday life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, collectible and video games are at the forefront of the innovation. Indeed, when it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the real-world applications of NFTs are very diverse, numerous, and much closer than we think. Thanks to their characteristics, NFTs can be an excellent support for the tokenization of real-life goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokenize means creating a token representing a good. The token by itself has no value; it draws its value from the good it represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenize-everything&#34;&gt;Tokenize everything!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization allows to handle goods like tokens which open a wide range of possibilities: exchange, P2P transferring, fractional ownership (0.x), etc. Besides, other features can be added depending on the tokenized goods: list of the previous owners, history of the value of the good, exhaustive list of the goods’ characteristics, limitations of ownership…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the benefits of tokenization are understood, we realize that tokenizing real goods will let us &lt;strong&gt;spare ourselves the need for greedy intermediaries while getting many exciting new features&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of real estate =&amp;gt; who need notaries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of pieces of art =&amp;gt; auctioneers and several other jobs would see their utility and even their existence challenged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of official documents (IDs for instance) =&amp;gt; a substantial cleanup in the actors and institutions currently involved in their emission, as well as those in charge of detecting and preventing frauds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three scenarios detailed above, checking the authenticity of these goods as well as making sure their owner is indeed the real owner of the good would be much easier than now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-disintermediation-thanks-to-tokenization&#34;&gt;The benefits of disintermediation thanks to tokenization
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization is much bigger than creating a token to represent a real-world good. Let’s come back to the definition of NFTs we proposed: “unique goods which share common attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tokenization would work as well for certificates. IDs, passports, report cards or even software license could be tokenized. Not only would it greatly facilitate the process of emitting and sharing them; it would also provide traceability, unlike anything we’ve ever known so far. Which in turns would make a 99.9% fraud detection and prevention goal a realistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we keep pushing the logic further, we could go back to the digital world and envision NFTs to store our digital identity. Our social network profiles could be open-source and easily exportable from one network to the others. Besides, it would give full control and ownership over our own data and prevent malicious third parties from stealing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get there, we need to &lt;strong&gt;overcome the current limitations of both the Ethereum network and non-fungible tokens&lt;/strong&gt;: as stated before, the CryptoKitties were enough to clog the whole Ethereum network for several days. The current state of the tech (or December’s state at least) is apparently insufficient for a large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ercsthe-new-standards-of-the-ethereumnetwork&#34;&gt;ERCs — The new standards of the Ethereum network
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Ethereum network, several teams are already working on the technical optimization of the network. Among them, we could mention Omisego/Plasma or the upcoming Ethereum update (Casper). Check the sources at the end of the article for resources on these matters; today we’re talking about NFTs so let’s get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-721 was a good start yet it faces many problems while going at scale. Before we get here, let’s zoom in on ERCs. An ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is a proposal submitted by an Ethereum developer. It introduces methods, behaviors, innovations or research that could be used to used to improve the network functionality. Once accepted, an ERC can become a standard — it’s quite a long process. Once again an example makes the concept much clearer: the most famous standard for Ethereum is the ERC-20. It described a fungible and straightforward token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The primary interest of ERCs is that they allow integrating the tokens within the ecosystem smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need to know the specifics of each token since they follow a set of methods shared with others (defined by the ERC). This is why a wallet which supports ERC-20 tokens support all of them without requiring particular development for each new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;erc-1155-the-future-of-non-fungible-tokens&#34;&gt;ERC-1155, the future of non-fungible tokens?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 is a new standard for NFTs proposed by Witek Radomski, the founder of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://enjincoin.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EnjinCoin&lt;/a&gt;, a platform made to facilitate the development of games with tokenized goods on the Ethereum network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 fixes many issues raised when trying to use NFTs based on the ERC-721 at scale, and also brings many new features. Regarding the technical optimization, the ERC-1155 allows sharing a given piece of code between several different tokens or collections of non-fungible tokens. It will enable to support a much higher volume of transactions for the same load on the Ethereum network (compared to the ERC-721).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ERC-1155, it’s also possible to exchange several items in one single transaction. With ERC-721, if Bob wants to exchange its cryptokitties #1, #2, #3 and #4 for Alice’s Cryptokitty #5, it would require 5 different transactions while one would be enough using ERC-1155.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 also supports fungibles goods which are plenty in online games: think about all the coins, potions, arrows and other consumables. Using only one standard, the ERC-1155, versus a mix of them (ERC-721 for non-fungible goods and ERC-20 for fungible goods) makes it much easier for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, ERC-1155 could treat NFTs in a group, allowing them to retain some fungibility. It would allow players to differentiation the different iteration of a same common object, and the first owner of it could prove he was indeed the first to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible goods are taking off, and Ethereum is a the forefront of the innovation. To better understand the ramifications of this concept, it’s best to go check its current usages. Let’s have a look at some games being developed/already available in pre-release versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/godsunchained.png&#34;

Gods Unchained&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://godsunchained.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gods Unchained&lt;/a&gt;: We used card games to introduce the concept, it’s only logical to find one here. Gods Unchained is among the most well-known one and uses the ERC-721 standard. The benefits compared to regular card games (such as Hearthstone) are numerous: immutability of the cards after the release (no more surprise nerfs), full transparency of the rarity of each type of cards, traceability of the previous owners of a given card… The team is focusing on eSports, and the first world championship will take place early 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decentraland.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt;: Take Minecraft, in virtual reality with blockchain-based mechanisms to handle ownerships: Welcome in today’s Tomorrowland! Once they own a piece of virtual land, users can create/develop the experience of their choosing (thanks to the SDK); they will then be able to control the access to their land and make other users pay for it if they want. Decentraland is a human and social experiment at world scale. It will be seriously insightful!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Augmentors&lt;/a&gt;: Since we were talking Pokémon earlier, what about Pokémon GO? Augmentors combined Augmented Reality with blockchain to offer a game where NFTs allow each user to truly own their augmented reality creatures and trade them as they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissing NFTs could be tempting as for now it could appear like something for kids and nerds. Yet, it’s precisely the opposite: as the CryptoKitties have demonstrated it, NFTs are one of the best Trojan horses to drive the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralization-based mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new technologies, the technical development is only the warming up phase. &lt;strong&gt;The real challenge lies with the social and legal acceptance of the tech: on that front, CryptoKitties and other collectibles are precursors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
