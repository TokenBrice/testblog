        <description>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/pegged-assets-swap-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Pegged Asset Swap Wars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, it’s been a while! As you likely know, liquidity management is both my passion and profession. In this article, I aim to revisit the basics and offer a brief history through the lens of pegged asset swaps. As we detail the liquidity structure and venues that best support those pairs, we will gain a deeper understanding of key concepts that remain critical to navigating that space today. We also get the chance to cover Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, the two most interesting releases of the year for liquidity-building who definitely deserved more airtime around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-days-of-pegged-asset-swaps-2018-2019&#34;&gt;The Early Days of Pegged Asset Swaps (2018-2019)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, more than half a decade ago, &lt;strong&gt;all we had to swap on the mainnet were Uniswap, Bancor, and some clunky order-book-based DEXes like EtherDelta.&lt;/strong&gt; So, when it came to pegged asset swaps, the options were minimal, and we were using the Uniswap V2 USDC/USDT pool, which was akin to sheer insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom in on this historical trivia to understand &lt;strong&gt;the level of waste that was achieved&lt;/strong&gt; at that time. When it comes to liquidity pools, the key parameter is the relative evolution of the two assets&amp;rsquo; prices: if you have done any volatile LPing, you’re deeply familiar with that. If you LP say LINK/ETH, the max pain for you, in terms of impermanent loss, is, for instance, ETH shooting up while LINK is dumping: your LP position decreases in ETH (which goes up in price), and accrues LINK (which is falling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USDC/USDT is another story, though, as the two assets are deeply correlated, with a maximum price difference ever seen between them of around 10% during a specific event (the USDC SVB depeg); in regular times, the two have a price difference in the basis point range. However, UNIv2 distributes the liquidity across the entire price range, meaning it allocates an equal amount of liquidity anywhere from 1 USDC = 0.0000000001 USDT to 1 USDC = 10000000000000 USDT. To put it simply: 99.9% of the liquidity in a UNIv2_USDC/USDT will never be utilized. I think it’s clearer on the graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/liquidity-structure.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquidity-structures&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only valuable liquidity there (assuming 1 USDC ≃ 1 USDT) is located at the intersection of the two green lines, making up a very minimal share of the entire liquidity distribution curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, note the stableswap liquidity distribution, displayed in blue, on the same graph. For assets at similar prices, the area covered by the curve is much greater than with the Uniswap invariant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stableswap-revolution-for-pegged-assets-swaps-2020&#34;&gt;The StableSwap Revolution for Pegged Assets Swaps (2020)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once StableSwap was available, stablecoin liquidity quickly migrated there, as it was significantly more efficient (we’re talking &amp;gt;100x improvements in efficiency vs UNIv2). It was &lt;strong&gt;the first live instance ever seen of Concentrated Liquidity on mainnet, before UNIv3&lt;/strong&gt;. The two are difficult to compare, as UNIv3 is much more flexible, while Curve-StableSwap is more specialized; however, kudos must be given where due. Along with increased efficiency, Curve provided an incentive model - veCRV+CRV emissions, which has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-wars/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;covered several times on this blog already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives are critical for pegged asset pairs, as they have some specific characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to be overall &lt;strong&gt;low-volume&lt;/strong&gt; (compared to a volatile pairing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The fees LP can charge are much lower **(up until recently, the convention was 0.3% to 1% per trade for volatile assets, and 0.05% for pegged assets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their volume comes in spikes&lt;/strong&gt; correlated to events associated with the coin (ex, USDC depeg was one of the highest volume days ever for USDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of the above, I thought until very recently that incentivization structures were even more critical for pegged asset pairs than for volatile assets. With the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, I don’t think it’s the case anymore. However, before we delve into them, we must first address another significant historical milestone in pegged assets liquidity: the release of Uniswap V3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-arrival-of-uniswap-v3-concentrated-liquidity-2021&#34;&gt;The arrival of Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity (2021)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniswap V3 released and delivered customizable concentrated liquidity to essentially every asset type, enabling massive efficiency gains for all liquidity providers. However, since it wasn’t just for pegged assets, it almost meant amplified impermanent losses for volatile assets LPs. Considering the novelty of the liquidity structure, along with the lack of infrastructure in the early days, the launch of UNIv3 was initially slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the customizable concentration delivered tangible benefits, especially for a subcategory of pegged assets I branded “loosely pegged assets”: think of pairs like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wstETH/ETH (correlated, but wstETH is up-only against ETH),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LUSD/USDC (correlated, but LUSD can slightly over/under-peg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such cases, &lt;strong&gt;UNIv3 concentrated liquidity enabled LPs to replicate a distribution similar in efficiency to Curve’s Stableswap but adjusted to the tokens&amp;rsquo; price action particularities&lt;/strong&gt;, and it translated once again into massive efficiency gains. However, the final unlock (as of the current industry state) was only to come years later with the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debt-as-liquidity-2025&#34;&gt;Debt as liquidity (2025)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t delve too deeply into the models of Fluid and EulerSwap in this post for conciseness, as I want to focus more on what it means for liquidity building. Simply put, Fluid found a creative way to transform debt into liquidity with “Smart Debt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture an average user supplying ETH collateral and borrowing USDC. Does he specifically want USDC? Most likely, he doesn’t care as long as he’s borrowing a safe and stable USD-pegged coin. He’d likely take USDT as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is precisely what smart debt does. In a smart debt vault, our borrower borrows a mix of USDC and USDT, which constantly evolves: his debt now serves as liquidity for the USDC/USDT pair. What that means for the borrowers is &lt;strong&gt;reduced borrowing cost, as he now earns trading fees&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially enabling him to offset the borrowing interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/fluid-smart-debt.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;fluid-smart-debt&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s from the borrower’s perspective, but now let’s switch to a protocol mindset. What does this mean for Circle and Tether? Essentially, &lt;strong&gt;liquidity at virtually 0 costs, with no form of incentivization whatsoever.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing really new there for Circle who has been sponsored by the whole ecosystem for years – but for another stablecoin, say a GHO, BOLD, or FRAX, that is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on Fluid here, but the thought process is similar for EulerSwap, although the implementation is different. EulerSwap is still in testing mode and already printing serious volume on USDC/USDT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand this, you can reach my thesis, which simply states, “I don’t see a DeFi where Euler/Fluid/Similar do not eventually dominate pegged-assets swaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seeing it yet? Remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegged assets pairs are usually low volume ⇒ low fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, they require heavy incentivization to maintain on a classical DEX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluid and Euler can sustain this liquidity at close to no cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ If (it already started) there is a race to the bottom in terms of fees for pegged asset swaps, regular DEXes have exactly 0% chances of winning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;0xorb-a-potential-challenger-2026&#34;&gt;0xOrb, a potential challenger (~2026)?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, to give you an accurate picture of the whole pegged asset swap landscape, I must mention another project not live yet, but promising: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://orbswap.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;0xOrb&lt;/a&gt;. The promise is simple: &lt;strong&gt;stableswap, but with n assets, n being able to go up to 1000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance, for stablecoin, you could picture a mega-pool well supplied in USDC and USDT, that then proceed to onboard “alternative” stablecoins and offer them great liquidity against the majors. The approach has merits for the long-tail of pegged assets, but I don’t see such pools dominating the core volume (USDC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;USDT or cbBTC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;wBTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, such pools could be cross-chain, although I think the benefit here is absolutely marginal if not &lt;strong&gt;detrimental&lt;/strong&gt; (⇒ increases the risks and complexity of the infra for no benefits), &lt;strong&gt;since USDC and USDT are increasingly bridgable 1:1 fast between chains thanks to product like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-for-incumbent-pure-dex-players&#34;&gt;What does it mean for incumbent pure-DEX players?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the most significant caveat: we’re discussing pegged asset swaps here. Replicating the same playbook on volatile pairs is much more challenging, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.fluid.io/t/current-issues-with-eth-usdc-pool/1606&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;as seen in Fluid’s Smart Debt+Collateral ETH/USDC vault and the losses its LP incurred&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEXes that generate most of their volume and fees through volatile pairs, such as Aerodrome, are likely not to be impacted by these new entrants. &lt;strong&gt;The reality is, however, much grimmer for DEXes focusing on pegged assets&lt;/strong&gt;, and I want to consider two of these to wrap this article up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curve-game-over-unless-there-are-sizeable-changes&#34;&gt;Curve: game over unless there are sizeable changes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegged assets swaps remain critical for Curve, still seen as the home of stablecoin liquidity. Indeed, there were attempts to capture volatile volume with CryptoSwap, but it proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of Fluid and EulerSwap, I think Curve is the DEX with the most to lose, and I don’t see it maintaining a prominent volume (they have already been kicked out of the top 10 a while ago) unless sizable changes are happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;veCRV revamp&lt;/strong&gt;: harnessing the learnings from newer models like veAERO to optimize the CRV emissions allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased DEX efficiency harnessing crvUSD&lt;/strong&gt;: for instance, by enabling crvUSD loans to Curve LPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new liquidity structure for volatile assets&lt;/strong&gt; : so that Curve can capture the associated volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ekubo-the-confident-latecomer-rushing-to-its-demise&#34;&gt;Ekubo: the confident latecomer rushing to its demise
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekubo’s situation is arguably even worse, as they came only recently to the party. At face value, Ekubo on Ethereum is a fast-growing DEX printing serious volumes. Ekubo is essentially a UNIv4-alt, with slightly more liquidity structure customization and a DAO that proved less extractive than Uniswap’s (the lowest bar of all, but still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in where the volume comes from: the vast majority (&amp;gt;95%) of it is on a USDC/USDT pair with 0.00005% fees and heavily incentivized. Ekubo is essentially playing a race to the bottom it cannot win because Ekubo cannot sustain extremely low fees in the long term (LPs must eat), while Fluid/Euler can (if borrowers receive even a 0.1% yield on their debt, thanks to smart debt, they are better off than without smart debt and thus happy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/ekubo.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;ekubo-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a $2.6M TVL pool, processing ~$130M volume daily for $662 of fees collected daily, incentivized ~8% in EKUBO, they are already fast approaching the limit of what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amusing aspect of all this is that &lt;strong&gt;Ekubo itself initiated the race to the bottom with the USDC/USDT swap fees and will be spectacularly vainquished at its own game&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi never ceases to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I hope this article was insightful and deepened your understanding of the pegged assets swap game. I look forward to getting my character trashed by the Ekubo community simply for stating an opinion driven by facts: their reaction gave me extreme confidence in my assessment, as I have observed the same response when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced MAI&amp;rsquo;s absurd security practices, and it got hacked + depegged shortly after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced R/David Garai&amp;rsquo;s gaslighting and lies, and R proceeded to get hacked into oblivion &amp;lt;6 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I criticized Prisma’s team behavior, and they proceeded to get hacked and shut down the protocol &amp;lt;12 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on. Best of luck to all, especially the EKUBO bag holders – try to have some class in your dismay that would serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/0-lending-protocol-renaissance-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we’ve seen a flurry of novel and exciting lending protocols come to market, such as Morpho, DYAD, Fluid, or Tapioca; even more are expected in the coming months, such as Liquity V2 (Bold) or Euler V2. All are innovative, in the arena, trying things to the point that I wonder if we’re not experiencing a lending protocol renaissance after a few years of rehashing the same concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this article, I’d like to give you a tour of the interesting ideas I’ve seen being explored — we’ll go through some of the protocols mentioned above and, for each, focus on understanding their main innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collateralized-debt-position-cdp-protocols-vs-money-market&#34;&gt;Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocols vs Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, starting with a primer on the differences between CDP protocols (e.g., Maker or Liquity) and money markets (e.g., Aave or Morpho). It will come in handy as we will discuss both in this article and even finish with a project merging the two models into one protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDP (ex: Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Market (ex: Aave)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borrower Interest Rate&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Predictable, can even be fixed or initiation fee only&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volatile, entirely dependent on pool usage&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral accepted&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually limited options, cannot mix collateral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various collateral: a given position can mix several collaterals at once&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assets that can be borrowed&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the protocol stablecoin (DAI on Marker, LUSD on Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse – any asset enabled as a borrowable asset&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral re-hypothecation&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral are deposited in a pool and thus potentially re-lent to other users&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol core challenge&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stabilizing the stablecoin outputted &amp; securing enough liquidity on it&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attracting sufficient borrowable assets (USDC, ETH) to fulfill borrowing demand&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol main risk&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ stablecoin death spiral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ all borrowable assets are drained&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols stand out for their ability to facilitate cheaper borrowing costs, thereby stimulating more borrowing-side demand, a challenging feat to achieve. This is due to the unique feature of CDPs, where the user directly contracts debt against the protocol, eliminating the need to source and pay an external stablecoin depositor demanding a competitive interest rate, as is the case with a money market like Aave. The primary challenge with CDPs lies in the stability and liquidity of the stablecoin that is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money markets tend to be more flexible. Thanks to their structure, they allow users to mix and match collateral and can quickly onboard new ones. Yet, they tend to require more maintenance, as collateral parameters must be constantly adjusted to reflect the realities of the market. This creates quite the load for governance, as seen on Aave, where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://boardroom.io/aave/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;over a thousand proposals&lt;/a&gt; were already processed in four and a half years: approximately 22 per month. It works, but it seems overengineered; surely there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dyad-flirting-with-the-endogenous-collateral-taboo&#34;&gt;DYAD: Flirting with the endogenous collateral taboo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyad is a CDP protocol that implements several novel ideas, such as delivering free borrowing to its users, who must own an NFT to partake (Note). It also serves as the protocol&amp;rsquo;s base coordination layer. I invite you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyad.gitbook.io/dyad-docs-v2/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the documentation&lt;/a&gt; to become more familiar with it. Let’s zoom in on Dyad’s novel approach to handling a key topic for CDP protocols: overcollateralization.&lt;/p&gt;

To quickly tell, ask yourself this question: if the stablecoin fails, does the collateral also fail? If yes, your collateral is endogenous (ex: my beloved &amp;amp; defunct &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage-based stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;); if not, it’s exogenous (ex: ETH for Liquity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins harnessing endogenous or no collateral can scale quickly, as seen with ESD, Basis Cash, or Terra/UST. However, they can and usually do explode even faster. For this reason, harnessing endogenous collateral is considered a risky practice – worthy of an instant Red Flag / F on the stablecoin rating agency &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bluechip.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bluechip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/1-endogenous-collateral-bluechip.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to focus on today regarding Dyad is its utility token, KEROSENE, which is a mechanism for allocating the right to mint against existing surplus collateral in the system. By default, the system&amp;rsquo;s minimal collateralization ratio is 150%. However, KEROSENE holders can deposit it into their Notes to reduce their exogenous collateral ratio to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, KEROSENE is not technically an endogenous collateral but a mechanism to price and enable users to harness the protocol&amp;rsquo;s exogenous over-collateralization. KEROSENE’s utility gives it a “deterministic value” corresponding to its utility while deposited into a Note. Since KEROSENE is mostly farmed by supplying liquidity on DYAD, it could entertain an interesting flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/2-dyad-defillama.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;2-dyad-defillama&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the year, the protocol has seen gentle and steady growth, although still limited. The rollout is progressive: the base functionalities are live (Note, DYAD minting, LP incentives, KEROSENE utility), yet much more is coming: sDYAD, momentum (a mechanism to better align protocol participants), a lending market, etc. It’s worth following for any stablecoin enjoyer such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-v2--the-base-rate-of-defi&#34;&gt;Liquity v2 – The base rate of DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity’s LUSD remains one of the most successful genuinely decentralized stablecoins on the mainnet, so when v2 was announced, it gathered a lot of attention. After researching a novel approach harnessing a reserve model, the team pivoted back to a CDP protocol, growing from learning the first iteration. V2 is expected to be released by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to focus on one, in particular, on interest rate management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate management is crucial for all lending protocols, even CDP protocols. The rate can be easily defined based on the market utilization rate in money markets. For CDP protocols, replicating a similar approach is impossible, and other venues must be explored; several were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance-defined (ex: Maker / DAI): while this approach provides flexibility, it generates uncertainty for borrowers and challenges in governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithmic (ex: Liquity / LUSD): no governance is always better, when possible; however, it doesn’t come without shortcomings either. In the case of Liquity, the set initiation fee proved inflexible, which led to the protocol adjusting to a higher interest rate environment with redemptions and, thus, through a lowering of the overall LUSD supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v2, the protocol switches to an interest rate model (no more initiation fee), which should already provide more agility. What’s more interesting is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/liquity-v2-why-user-set-interest-rates&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how this interest rate is decided: directly by the users&lt;/a&gt;. The team introduces another protocol-level game with straightforward parameters: redemptions will be processed based on the interest rate paid by the user, from lowest to highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, users who choose a very low interest will put themselves first in line for redemptions, while those who pick the highest interest will be maximally protected. To make it easy for any user to partake, interest rate delegation will be possible, with various delegates delivering different mandates expected at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the protocol to rapidly adjust to all kinds of market environments, from low interest rates to high, avoiding the long redemption phases as seen in v1 while remaining immutable and delivering greater predictability to borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/3-bold-stability.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3-bold-stability&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the protocol gains adoption, the average interest rate observed could even inform beyond Liquity v2 itself, as it will correspond to a base rate borrowers are willing to pay on a risk-minimized and immutable protocol. Riskier protocols will have to offer a lower interest rate to attract borrowers. The v2 packs many more interesting innovations. To get up to speed, I recommend checking out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/bjnpck/status/1772227278606389496&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bojan’s thread of threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tapioca--cdp-x-money-market-convergence&#34;&gt;Tapioca – CDP x Money Market Convergence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapioca was launched just a few weeks ago and is still being progressively released, as some protocol components still need to be made live. In today’s highlight, I’d like to focus on two main items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of the CDP and Money Market model with Tapioca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The innovative token lock model harnessed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in. For more context about Tapioca, as often, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.tapioca.xyz/tapioca&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convergence-of-cdp-and-money-market&#34;&gt;Convergence of CDP and Money Market
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols face a challenge: they must deliver competitive yield on the stablecoin they output to drive demand. Liquity v2 will redirect most of the fees collected, thanks to the interest rate, to BOLD stakers, Maker has the DSR / sDAI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, another way to ensure stablecoin minters can access competitive yields is to build a money market on top of the stablecoin: that’s precisely what Tapioca is doing. Indeed, Tapioca is essentially a double protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the CDP—branded “Big Bang,” where users can mint USDO against selected collateral: gas tokens and LSDs. The collateral selection is purposely restrictive, as tokens accepted here directly affect USDO backing. Borrowers pay an interest rate and, depending on USDO’s peg situation, potentially an initiation fee of up to 1% (if underpeg). It enables users to loop-leverage their ETH / LSD exposure or simply harness their ETH / LSD as collateral to borrow some USDO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the money market — branded “Singularity,” which provides isolated markets where users can supply various types of collateral to borrow USDO, supplied by borrowers on the CDP side. This creates a native yield for USDO holders that is decorrelated from the CDP side, as well as offering an elegant approach to handle all types of collateral:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship resistant majors ⇒ CDP collateral =backing USDO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivatives / more risky tokens ⇒ Singularity = yield to USDO holders without compromising USDO’s backing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual structure allows Tapioca to host various collateral, with appropriate risk-mitigation measures for each. Since singularity harnesses isolated markets, the risk for each collateral onboarded there is isolated, and it can be further managed with its parametrization (LTV, interest rate, and liquidation bonus) and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twaml-an-innovative-token-locking-model&#34;&gt;twAML: an innovative token-locking model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After following and commenting on the DEX evolutions, starting with veCRV and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-vs-velo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the improvements we observed with Velodrome (veNFT)&lt;/a&gt;, I anticipated seeing token lock models harnessed on lending protocols too. It has been, but only in a primitive manner, with gauge-based emissions &amp;amp; governance token locking to allocate them, such as seen on Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca finally delivers with an exciting approach harnessing a new type of token locking (twAML), both for their governance token TAP and for the suppliers of the money market, to secure the supply side and thus drive more borrowing demand. Hence, after Velodrome improved the veCRV model and delivered the first credible improvement over veCRV, we might see its third iteration come to fruition. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td colspan=&#34;4&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Locking Model Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veNFT (ex: veVELO)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;twAML (ex: twTAP)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locked Position Transferable&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;TKN &amp;lt;&gt; veTKN ratio&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solely dependent on time duration, one veTKN per TKN if 4-year lock&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depends on twAML – the average lock duration of other lockers: if equal/above, then one veTKN per TKN&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veTKN &amp;lt;&gt; TKN Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, linear over time (ex, after 2 years of lock, only 0.5 veTKN per TKN)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Interest Accrued &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquidation Profit Shares&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Creation Fees&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Mint Fee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main innovation lies in the flexibility and additional game theory layer this model implements. Instead of a linear veTKN to TKN correspondence, depending on the time locked and maxing at four years, like with veCRV and veAERO, twAML looks at other lockers&amp;rsquo; average lock time (magnitude weighted). In practice, achieving a 1:1 TKN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;veTKN correspondence no longer requires a four-year lock but simply to lock for as much / longer than the existing locks. Thus, the lock time will rapidly increase during the first epoch, ramping up from the 4-week maximum initially set up until it finds an equilibrium point and potentially starts to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/4-twTAP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;4-twTAP&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released for the first time with dynamic adjusting, the twAML was met with excessive degeneracy and quickly ramped up over four years. Thus, the team has returned to work and switched the adjustment to epoch-based. The new iteration is expected in the coming weeks, another development worth monitoring for stablecoin and lock tokens enjoyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca is quite the beefy protocol, two years in the work. I’ve barely scratched the surface there, as there are many other components worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s natively omnichain harnessing Layer 0&amp;rsquo;s omnichain fungible token standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapioca, like Liquity, will be one of the few CDP protocols redirecting fees generated from stablecoin minting to its token holders through the twTAP model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewards for USDO lockers are distributed in oTAP, an option token connected to the twAML logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol is keen on accruing Protocol-Owned Liquidity, both for TAP and USDO, which will enable it to lower its liquidity maintenance costs and potentially turn it into a profitable endeavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cover more protocols, but this article is already beefy, so I’ll keep it there for today. There are many exciting developments for lending protocols worth discussing, such as the growth of isolated markets with protocols like Morpho or Silo. All of this and more leads me to believe that after years of Aave &amp;amp; Maker dominating the lending protocol landscape, we might see some challengers rising to a similar size, if not overtaking them in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be watching, and so should you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Gray for the cover image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Subtles nuances with great consequences: a cross analysis of Curve and Velodrome" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to address Velodrome/Aerodrome, a genuine success story in DeFi. I’ve covered DEXes extensively on this blog, especially Curve: this article will compare the two models and explain how Velodrome improved on the veCRV template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me start with a disclaimer: there are two core components to a DEX that everyone needs to be aware of to understand what follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The liquidity structures it provides (x*y=k, stableswap, CL, stableswap-NG, curve V2, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentives model, which for a DEX is synonymous with its tokenomics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on the latter, the core of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s innovation. This post assumes basic familiarity with Curve’s veCRV tokenomics; if not, I urge you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/fr/crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read my previous writing about it&lt;/a&gt;, posted three years ago but still helpful to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vecrvvevelo-fees-collection--distribution&#34;&gt;A/ veCRV/veVELO Fees Collection &amp;amp; Distribution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fee collection and redistribution are the lifelines of a decentralized exchange. Here, simplicity is usually good, as the DEX segment leader Uniswap is still operating under an extremely simple yet brutally efficient model, where 100% of the collected money goes to the liquidity providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of its CRV token in August 2020, Curve explored an alternative path, where 50% of the fees collected on a given pair go to liquidity providers and the remaining 50% to the “DAO” (admin fees), meaning the veCRV holders. Curve introduced the concept of “liquidity gauges,” where locked token holders (veCRV) can direct emissions to be received by liquidity providers, creating an incentive baseline independent of the volume processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome launched two years later, at the end of May 2022, and explored yet another split, inspired by a previous project iterating on the Curve model: Solidly. Here, &lt;strong&gt;LPs get no exposure to the fees collected on the pairs they provide liquidity for and are fully incentivized by token emissions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core difference between veCRV and veVELO lies in how they handle the fees collected at the DEX/DAO level, where we observe differences in the amount of fees collected and their distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the nuances of this topic: they are key to understanding the pros and cons of each mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a1-amount-of-fees-distributed-velo--2-x-curve&#34;&gt;A.1/ Amount of fees distributed: VELO = 2 x Curve
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve and Velodrome operate under the same base logic: every week, a given amount of CRV/VELO tokens are emitted and distributed to liquidity providers. Each pool has an associated gauge for which veCRV/veVELO holders can vote, and the weekly budget allocation follows the proportion of the “gauge vote”: if a gauge receives 1% of the total veCRV/veVELO vote, 1% of all the emissions produced that week will be directed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are essentially the main cost for the DEX: the price paid to attract and retain liquidity. What matters then is what comes on the other side of the balance sheet – the revenues: in our case, it’s the fees collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, revenues stem from the “admin fees” of each pool, which are usually set at 50%. This means the fees collected on a given pool are split 50/50 between the LP and the DAO/veCRV holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/curve-revenues.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-revenues&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward: liquidity providers get no exposure to the fees collected on the pool they supply; they are incentivized through $VELO emissions only, meaning that the DAO/veVELO holders get 100% of the fees generated on the DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this core difference already has a massive impact, the following one is even more meaningful as it pertains to how those fees are distributed to veCRV/veVELO holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a2-model-for-the-distribution-of-fees-a-fairer-and-more-efficient-approach&#34;&gt;A.2/ Model for the distribution of fees: a fairer and more efficient approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve harnesses a model that could be described as &lt;strong&gt;a fee mutualization system&lt;/strong&gt;: the fees veCRV holders receive depend only on the amount of veCRV they control. Without getting too technical, those fees are collected in the various tokens involved in the pool (such as USDC/USDT/DAI for the 3pool), and every week, harvested, swapped for 3pool LP token, and then made available for claiming to veCRV holders – as you can see, this means somewhat of an infrastructure to operate, the cost of which scale with the number of pools on the Curve DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Velodrome provides a superior model on all dimensions, as it achieves better DEX/LP/token holder alignment without any infrastructure required. Let’s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome connects gauge-voting activity with fee distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, the amount of veVELO one controls matters, but even more important is which pool one votes for since the &lt;strong&gt;voters are exposed to the fees collected on the pairs they vote for only.&lt;/strong&gt; They collect the fees as such (i.e., a voter of the ETH/USDC pool gets ETH and USDC), meaning the infrastructure required is much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome ties fee distribution to the gauge-voting activity: veVELO holders receive the fees collected on the pool they vote ONLY, paid as such every week. It enables the better alignment of veVELO holders with the best interest of Velodrome as a DEX compared to Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple twist creates an interesting voting flywheel. High-volume pairs collect lots of fees, meaning high incentives for voters. This leads to many votes, which direct sensible emissions to the pair, attracting more liquidity providers, enabling more volume processing, etc., until an equilibrium point is reached. This means that high-volume pairs sustain themselves without bribes or a benevolent profit-minimizer whale-voter needed, which is not the case with Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a3-what-it-means-in-practice&#34;&gt;A.3/ What it means in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough with the explainer; let’s illustrate by considering the case of a veCRV/veVELO voter, who decided to vote for a pair processing minimal volume (the situation is common).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veCRV holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Curve as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives the same amount of 3CRV as a more Curve-aligned voter with an equivalent veCRV bag trying to direct incentives to maximize volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Velodrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veVELO holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Velodrome as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives a marginal amount of fees since the pool he is voting for is processing a marginal volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is the same in reverse for voting on a high-volume pool that would be of interest to the DEX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Curve, this DEX-aligned voter will receive the same amount of 3CRV as anyone holding the same bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Velodrome, this DEX-aligned voter will be well rewarded, as he will be a majority voter on a high-volume pair: an ideal situation to maximize fees earned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both sides, bribes are paid to voters and can lead to situations where votes are directed to pools that are not optimal in terms of volume processed. However, on Curve, there is no penalty for doing so. On Velodrome, bribers of such pools compete with high-volume pools offering attractive APR to voters, with or without bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing, from another angle: on Curve, the cost of bribes depends only on the value of CRV emissions. On Velodrome, the baseline price a project must pay to gather votes depends on the total bribes + fees collected on other pools. This means that high-volume pools push the cost of bribes upward, entertaining yet another flywheel in the flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the above means understanding the core difference between the Curve and Velodrome models. However, to get the full picture, more elements must be considered. Let’s discuss the LP boost now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;b-lp-boosts--its-impact-on-the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;B/ LP boosts &amp;amp; its impact on the ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LP boost, as it is called, is a Curve-specific feature. Many protocols forking the veCRV tokenomics, such as Balancer with its veBAL, also use it. It enables veCRV holders to earn more CRV rewards on their LP, factoring in several elements, including the size of their veCRV bag and the size of their various LPs. Thus, with appropriate veCRV ownership, an LP can get an “LP Boost” of up to 2.5x compared to the base emission rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b1-lp-boost-explained&#34;&gt;B.1/ LP Boost explained
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize the boost obtained, up to 2.5x maximal, one must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own as much veCRV as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have LP positions in as many pools as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a proportionate/balanced amount of TVL in those various pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simply put, LP Boost is a rugged game from the get-go&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not designed to benefit individual veCRV holders over their LP but to attract meta-protocol, such as Convex, who can achieve 1+2+3 consistently. &lt;strong&gt;The growth of Convex is not a success story; it is by design (Curve’s design)&lt;/strong&gt;. If it were not for Convex, another similar protocol would own most of the veCRV supply. We observed similar patterns with other protocols that adopted LP Boost: Balancer has Aura. Convex and Aura control &amp;gt; 50% of the veCRV/veBAL supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome and Aerodrome completely avoid the possibility of a new protocol to gobble up the supply by not having any boosting mechanism. As we’ve seen with Curve, Convex emerged and captured most of the supply; now, all LPs are earning with a boost, and none are benefiting from any disproportionate amount of CRV. The system has converged to everyone earning about the same effective boost, or in Velodrome/Aerodrome’s case, no boost since the future outcome would’ve been LPs earning the same effective boost. The other fact remains that since Convex has a majority of CRV locked, they control the future governance of CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b2-consequences-of-lp-boost&#34;&gt;B.2/ Consequences of LP Boost
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the LP-Boost calls for a Convex-like layer on top of the DEX; there is no avoiding it. At this point, some could think: &amp;ldquo;So you have a protocol gobbling most of your emissions and locking them forever; what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s simply inefficient design since those meta-layers provide features that could be delivered less convoluted at the base level (by the DEX itself) and without the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve needs Convex and the bribe marketplace: Votium, Warden, and Hidden Hands. But also the auto-compounder/vote delegation manager: Airforce Union, Concentrator, etc. You end up with dozens of protocols taking some fees here and there to deliver something that Velodrome manages to pack in natively. This makes the experience more complex for the users, who must know about these dozens of protocols and their subtleties to make the most of Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember how, while discussing the fee distribution, we mentioned that Curve required a much more dense infrastructure to operate? Well, imagine the mess that veCRV+LP Boost is in the backend. There is a reason why both Curve and Balancer are taking ages to ship on a new L2, and often with partial functionality (such as no LP boost, surprise surprise.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;seamlessly-expanding-beyond-what-curve-offers&#34;&gt;Seamlessly expanding beyond what Curve offers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, the bribe marketplace is built-in: projects can post their bribes directly on the Velodrome frontend, and voters can check available bribes and vote in the same place. New features keep being delivered and added to the same interface used by all participants: LPs, projects, and tokenholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;velodrome-relays&#34;&gt;Velodrome Relays
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go from quality-of-life / gas-saving upgrades, such as the “auto-max-lock”, saving lockers for those who wish to remain max-locked to maximize their gauge-voting power the hassle of doing it manually, to much more extensive features, like Relay, a veVELO position management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/relay.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;velodrome-relay&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tool catering to projects using Velodrome to grow liquidity on their pairs. It enables them to set up their voting and bribing strategy and implement it automatically: no need to submit weekly transactions anymore. Relay has another benefit, since currently, the strategy available is a veVELO-maxi one, compounding all fees &amp;amp; bribes collected into VELO and relocking it to maximize voting power: it creates a sizeable VELO sink, directly indexed on the fees distributed by the exchange. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1762908204894445834&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Almost 1/5 of all veVELO are already there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Relay feature matures, more strategies will be available to its users, including some that compound all the fees and bribes earned into veVELO but, for instance, make them claimable in ETH or USDC. It will prove very convenient for veVELO holders that are not looking to support a project in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;venft-tokenized-locked-positions&#34;&gt;veNFT: Tokenized locked positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velodrome has other neat innovations packed in, such as the still under-appreciated veNFT: with Curve, veCRV is non-transferable, making their management painful. Velodrome can achieve the same alignment but enables transferability: veVELO positions are represented by a veNFT that can be transferred. There is no way of redeeming a given veNFT for the underlying VELO tokens apart from waiting for the lock to expire. However, it eases the management of such a position by enabling its transfer. There is also &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decode.market/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an OTC market for veVELO veNFTs&lt;/a&gt;, where holders can sell their position to interested buyers at a fluctuating discount compared to the value of underlying VELO tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-deep-understanding-of-the-nature-of-the-game&#34;&gt;A deep understanding of the nature of the game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges like Curve or Velodrome are a particular product type in the DeFi landscape. In regular business terms, &lt;strong&gt;they could be described as B2B2C: Business to Business to Consumer&lt;/strong&gt;. They are B2B because their first customers are other projects – the various protocols looking for liquidity. If they successfully service this market, the projects they onboard to their DEX will do the B2C work for them, as their liquidity pools present opportunities to their respective token holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I feel like Curve utterly failed. With its pyramid of solutions nested on top of one another, Curve is particularly unfriendly to onboard for projects. They wanna bribe? All right, decide between veCRV or vlCVX bribes on Bribe.crv, Votium, Warden, or StakeDAO. Do they want to manage their own CRV? Fine, just pick between veCRV, aCRV, cvxCRV, sdCRV, vlCVX, uCRV, etc. While this myriad of options might ravish Curve-enthusiasts, it turns, in my perspective, into a negative quality for the B2B side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the experience with Velodrome is seamless: one place where everything happens, one option for each – without needing to compare between half a dozen cryptic and sometimes misleading alternatives. Coupled with the previous characteristics of the veCRV games discussed before, especially the LP Boost, it makes the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/farewell-glc/#the-case-of-the-crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve ecosystem particularly unfriendly to new entrants&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;who would want to enter a race rigged in favor of the first entrants three years after it began&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/tour-de-op.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tour-de-op&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Velodrome BD efforts are remarkable; the team is broadly available to help onboard new projects, and several programs are designed to make the experience as simple and compelling for new entrants, regrouped under the “Tour de OP” umbrella, which includes a bribe matching program, lock bonuses and vote boosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;PARTING WORDS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might have seen, both Velodrome &amp;amp; Aerodrome have attracted much attention lately, thanks to their token seeing positive momentum: I think it&amp;rsquo;s well deserved. The release of Slipstream, Velodrome’s implementation of Concentrated Liquidity, will increase the volume processed per unit of TVL, unlocking the flywheel&amp;rsquo;s next growth phase. Aerodrome, Velodrome’s fork on the Base network, has seen spectacular growth since it launched six months ago, further demonstrating the model&amp;rsquo;s viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the Velodrome team is starting to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-metadex-48e4af1ef9a4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;refer to Velo as a &amp;ldquo;MetaDEX&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at Velodrome becoming the base liquidity hub not just of Optimism but for the whole Superchain: all chains built on the OP stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell, but Velodrome is already a resounding success on Optimism, so managing a cross-chain DEX properly would be a game changer. This is especially true considering how much Curve &amp;amp; Balancer has failed there—not because they did not try, but simply because their convoluted infrastructure with LP boost makes cross-chain deployment painful (Hello AuraFinance distributing AURA on chains where&amp;hellip; there is no liquidity for $AURA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I’m addressing the DEX part of the product suite here, which is the complete product for Velodrome but not for Curve, which now has crvUSD and Llamalend. Still, even with crvUSD included, Aerodrome is now collecting and redistributing more fees than Curve, all of this while being present on one chain only vs 13 for Curve. While Curve-DEX has been sub-par for a while, the team has repeatedly proven innovative and able to bounce back. crvUSD revenues have already flipped those of Curve-DEX, and who knows what Llamalend could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game on: let’s wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since Maverick is out, and a few days since the MAV token joined the fray. Yet, most of DeFi is still scratching its head regarding how Maverick delivers 2-3x the capital efficiency of its top competitor, Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the time was right for a deep dive into the innovations brought by the model and the new paradigm it fosters regarding liquidity management: &lt;strong&gt;liquidity shaping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-on-dex-more-like-tools-for-lp-to-express-themselves&#34;&gt;Innovations on DEX? More like tools for LP to express themselves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a decentralized exchange can innovate at two levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure&lt;/strong&gt;: the options offered to liquidity providers to design the supply activity that best matches their thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And/or &lt;strong&gt;the incentivization model&lt;/strong&gt;: the tools and modalities enabling DAOs &amp;amp; projects to incentivize customized or not liquidity structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most new DEX being released recycle an existing infrastructure and focus on innovating on only one dimension - usually the incentivization model - as seen recently with the wave of Solidly/Velodrome forks - &lt;strong&gt;[ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?](&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a few critical moments in the industry when a new DEX was released and provided &lt;strong&gt;critical innovation on both fronts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V1/V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; established a solid infrastructure for &lt;code&gt;x*y=k&lt;/code&gt; pools &amp;amp; basic incentivization model: 30 bps fees auto compounded &amp;amp; the possibility of having Liquidity Mining programs on the staked LP tokens (ERC20).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve&lt;/strong&gt; provided an innovative and efficient liquidity model for pegged assets (stableswap) while pioneering a ve/gauge-based model for liquidity provider incentivization introducing a revenue capture at the token level (admin fee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UniswapV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; delivered the tools to manage a more advanced liquidity structure harnessing concentrated liquidity efficiently and providing more flexibility fee-wise (1, 5, 30, 100 bps fees, not auto-compounded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally came &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/maverick-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which goes even further than UniswapV3 in the customization of the liquidity structure it provides, offers streamlined position management (native rebalancing) and an unprecedented level of control regarding incentivization options, marking the birth of a new paradigm: liquidity shaping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each core innovations &lt;strong&gt;enable more expressivity for LPs: they get access to increasingly refined and customized tools enabling even the most intricate thesis to find a proper medium to be expressed onchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, before diving into the depth of liquidity shaping, some pointers on Maverick are necessary. Indeed, to fully understand the impact of liquidity shaping on Maverick, you first need to master its liquidity structures and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-liquidity-structures&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S LIQUIDITY STRUCTURES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of Maverick&amp;rsquo;s critical innovations is its liquidity structures, enabling the exchange to reach an unprecedented level of capital efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick offers four options to LP that could be regrouped into two categories for simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static mode is similar to a UNIv3 liquidity providing across a custom range, with &lt;strong&gt;immensely more flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And three dynamic modes offer &lt;strong&gt;various flavors of rebalancing to LP&lt;/strong&gt; to optimize further their earning: left (follows price to the left), right (follows price to the right), and both (follows price both ways).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mavericks-static-mode-is-a-game-changer&#34;&gt;Why Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Static Mode is a game changer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many still have to understand how much of an improvement Maverick&amp;rsquo;s static mode is over UNIv3, so let us focus on it for a minute. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick table recapping the main difference to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Uniswap v3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Maverick Static Pools&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supply liquidity in an arbitrary custom range, even potentially only with one token&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Support an uneven liquidity distribution within that range&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports customized fees and width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 fees tiers, 1 width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Near-infinite fee/width tiers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports the creation of ERC-20-wrapped LP tokens to ease LP onboarding &amp;amp; incentivization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ (Boosted Pools)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the distribution of rewards (Liquidity Mining)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the weighted &amp;amp; customized distribution of rewards to LP (Liquidity Shaping)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like UniswapV3, Maverick supports supplying liquidity in &lt;strong&gt;an arbitrary custom range,&lt;/strong&gt; even potentially only with one token, for instance, an LP on ETH/USDC from $2000 to $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current price is below $2000 (at the time of writing: $1900), the LP will be supplied purely with ETH and progressively rebalances to USDC as the price moves upwards, ending entirely in USDC at $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about LPs that have an even more refined thesis? What about the LP that sees ETH in that range for a week but mainly in the $2150-2250 area? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice for him to be able to express this thesis through the liquidity structure he chooses? It is precisely what Maverick enables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot above, you see a distribution from $2000 to $2400 on the ETH/USDC pair; however, &lt;strong&gt;unlike Uniswap, which necessarily distributes liquidity evenly across the range, Maverick enables LPs to choose&lt;/strong&gt;. To better fit our LP thesis, most of the liquidity is concentrated over the three ticks covering the $2150-2250 price zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maximizing-the-expressivity-offered-to-lps&#34;&gt;Maximizing the expressivity offered to LPs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expressivity offered to LP on Maverick is virtually infinite. I expect to see some interesting use cases emerge soon, especially for the protocols that will harness Maverick from the get-go (&amp;ldquo;Maverick-native&amp;rdquo; protocols). For instance, y&lt;strong&gt;ou could envision Maverick as a price stabilization mechanism for a stablecoin or a pegged asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the stablecoin project controls some liquidity, it could supply it in very expressive ways in times of need to constraint the price range. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;buy wall&amp;rdquo; liquidity structure on LUSD: the whole liquidity of this LP is supplied on a single tick, the first one where LUSD is worth below 1.00 USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a current price &amp;gt;1.00 USDC, this LP is supplied 100% in USDC and acts like a buying reserve: if the price of LUSD falls, the LP will rebalance. Such positions are promising, as they can exert buy/sell pressure helping to better constrain peg assets within narrower ranges, which massively reduces the cost of their liquidity incentivization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-the-dynamic-modes&#34;&gt;What about the dynamic modes?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick dynamic modes offer a convenient and easy solution for LPs who maximize their exposure to market prices to maximize the volume processed. All three modes essentially harness the same structure but give different options to LP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price just one way (left or right) - there are tons of pairs where it makes a lot of sense, like wstETH/ETH (wstETH being &amp;ldquo;up-only&amp;rdquo; against ETH thanks to the staking yield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price both ways, a good match for LP looking to maximize adequate liquidity and fees collected at the expense of increased IL risk on the principal. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly suited for stable and pegged asset pairs, but not only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;Maverick delivers native rebalancing to its LP&lt;/strong&gt;, and here again, it goes above and beyond what preceded in terms of customization options. &amp;ldquo;Native&amp;rdquo; is the keyword here, meaning the rebalancing can be &lt;strong&gt;done cleverly and gas-efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. While this is not new by itself, here again, the devil lies in the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, LPs have no options: their liquidity is concentrated, but all LPs of a given pair are under the same regime. It eases the management, but kills the expressivity. With Uniswap, LPs can dynamically rebalance their position using third-party tools like Arrakis; it comes with sizable trust assumptions, potential fees, and hefty gas costs. It allows more expressivity but requires more active management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are some limits to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s liquidity rebalancing, based on a TWAP and with some delays to avoid manipulations, it remains a crucial tool to help LPs maximize the time effectively spent in range / in the current price tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-incentivization-model-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S INCENTIVIZATION MODEL: LIQUIDITY SHAPING
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the first fundamental innovation brought by Maverick - the unprecedented expressivity offered to LP in the design and management of their position - we can now explore Maverick&amp;rsquo;s second leg: its novel incentivization model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story here is both short and long. &lt;strong&gt;In short, Maverick provides the same level of customization at the incentivization layer as at the pool creation level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads us to a longer story, with examples to be more explicit. Replicating most existing liquidity structures and incentivization models on Maverick is possible. But what&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting are the new ones previously never tried because they were not technically feasible before Maverick: it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-contract-triggered-buysell-walls&#34;&gt;Dynamic contract-triggered buy/sell walls
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the example from earlier about the stablecoin project posting liquidity as a buying wall to constrain the price? &lt;strong&gt;The project does not even needs its liquidity to do it&lt;/strong&gt;, as the same process can be replicated with a boosted pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project creates a boosted pool where all the liquidity is distributed on one tick below the price like above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project supplies incentives to the boosted pool for the duration of its choice &amp;amp; apes will do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can be automated and triggered entirely through smart contracts, meaning another contract could dynamically manage the incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-cvxcrvcrv&#34;&gt;The case of cvxCRV/CRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s study another checkmate case, the one of cvxCRV. Indeed, the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool is the absolute worst offender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;a regular structure, absolutely sub-optimal for an asset trading in a constrained range like cvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; liquidity mining model where all LPs are paid equally&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to cvxCRV deposits, which make 75% of the pool, earning 75% of the rewards - while being close to useless liquidity-wise (as there are already too much cvxCRV in that pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-can-be-done-better&#34;&gt;So what can be done better?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the concentration could be finetuned much more at the liquidity structure level. cvxCRV is a &amp;ldquo;one-way asset&amp;rdquo;: you can wrap CRV to cvxCRV 1:1 through the Convex contracts, but converting cvxCRV to CRV is done on a DEX at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; This means cvxCRV has a price ceiling against CRV: in no world, cvxCRV could be worth &amp;gt;1 CRV, and the current price is around 0.95 CRV per cvxCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; The ideal structure for such a pool could be &lt;strong&gt;a concentration going from 1cvxCRV = 0.9 CRV to 1 cvxCRV = 0.99 CRV, offering vastly superior liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the incentivization layer, massive gains are to be made with a switch. Instead of paying all LPs equally while the pool is massively unbalanced, why not focus on those who bring the most value to the pool, aka the CRV component?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d go with two joint pools to best cover that pair incentivize-wise: &lt;strong&gt;first, a static LP over ten bins&lt;/strong&gt; centered around the current price - it provides room for the price to express itself with sufficient liquidity &amp;amp; this structure is already &amp;gt;100x more efficient than the existing Curve V2 pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; For the nail in the coffin, we can &lt;strong&gt;add a one-tick left-right pool one top to maximize liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of this example help you understand that if you take this pool to Maverick, the compounded effect of the superior liquidity structure with a vastly more efficient incentivization model leads to results from a different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently $54M TVL in Curve cvxCRV/CRV pool for a daily volume of around $300k daily (0.5% utilization). With a base incentive of 12% CRV, ~&lt;strong&gt;$6M of CRV tokens are expanded yearly to maintain this liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Maverick, a ~$500K  properly structured pool&lt;/strong&gt; ($250k static broad range + $250k left-right) &lt;strong&gt;would be sufficient to consistently process the $300k daily volume&lt;/strong&gt; with better prices than on Curve. Assuming the same incentivization intensity, &lt;strong&gt;it would cost $60k a year to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proto-liquidity-shaping-with-bunni&#34;&gt;Proto Liquidity Shaping with Bunni?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that, at this point, you get a better sense of why liquidity shaping is genuinely revolutionary, as it will allow another order-of-magnitude leap regarding the efficiency of both the liquidity structures and the incentivization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are earlier, less complete iterations on such a concept, provided by the liquidity manager built on top of UniswapV3 that allows incentivization on a customized range, for instance, rewards for LUSD/USDC LP, but only for the LUSD = 0.999 USDC to LUSD = 1.01 USDC range. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bunni.pro/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bunni&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those could be described as &amp;ldquo;proto liquidity shaping,&amp;rdquo; as they enable to force a specific price range but cannot apply different weights to each tick in that range: they are limited by the Uniswap V3 pool model that offers less flexibility than Maverick. In the end, both are quite complimentary as Bunni can be used to force a wide range, which can be further refined with a uneven static Maverick pool &amp;amp; finally maintained uber liquid at current price with a left-right on Maverick too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mav-token&#34;&gt;MAV TOKEN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clear perspectives on both the novel pool structure and incentivization model and their consequences, we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to add the last piece of a puzzle, one you&amp;rsquo;re likely more familiar with, but here too, there are key differences: the MAV token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released just a few weeks ago, the MAV token has been airdropped to early liquidity providers and protocol users. The initial airdrop is just &lt;strong&gt;the first of many&lt;/strong&gt;, and more are planned, for LPs, but also protocols harnessing Maverick or building on top of it. For more details on the intended distribution, check this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;As readers of this blog, I imagine you are extensively familiar with the veCRV model and its implications. If not, you&amp;rsquo;ve got some reading to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vemav--liquidity-directing-voting-vote-directed-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;veMAV &amp;amp; Liquidity Directing Voting (vote-directed liquidity shaping)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/vemav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;vemav&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the MAV token is sequential, currently in phase 1, where users can claim their drop, LP MAV, or lock it to obtain veMAV. &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 will introduce Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Directing Voting and mark the true beginning of the MAV races.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is, of course, the expressivity enabled by Maverick that will also impact the tokenomics: unlike on veCRV or veBAL, where projects allocate liquidity to a whole pool, here, with Maverick, &lt;strong&gt;protocols will be able to target their voting power to a specific part of the AMM distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more information on veMAV here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/introducing-maverick-protocols-voting-escrow-model-c29a60120339&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introducing Maverick Protocol&amp;rsquo;s Voting-Escrow Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maverick--vemav-x-chain-strategy&#34;&gt;Maverick &amp;amp; veMAV X-chain strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical thing to note with the MAV token is that it implements &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/layerzero-omnichain-contracts/oft&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Layer Zero&amp;rsquo;s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard&lt;/a&gt;, greatly facilitating cross-chain operations. It enables MAV to exist natively on every chain and should ease the operational overhard for the team to launch the gauge system on a new network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem much at first glance, but it could make a massive difference. Indeed, Curve and Balancer have been slow to export their full gauge model to networks other than the mainnet they initially operate on. &lt;strong&gt;I expect Maverick to move much more quickly&lt;/strong&gt;, and the early empirical data validate it. In ~3 months of existence, Maverick has already launched two chains apart from mainnet: zkSync and BSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;another-main-difference-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Another main difference with veCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;veMAV implements several other changes compared to a base veCRV model, and I invite you to identify them all. Here are some other ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The veMAV per MAV weighting is not linear here, even if it still favors max lockers (4 years); the min lock of 1 week gives one veMAV/MAV, while max locking gives 5veMAV/MAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no linear decay&lt;/strong&gt; like on veCRV - which is a significant UX improvement. It could also have very positive consequences for veMAV liquid wrappers, making it easier to keep close to the peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet there are still incentives to stay committed. Indeed, The veMAV/MAV ratio is computed with the formula &lt;code&gt;1.5^(lock end - contract launch)&lt;/code&gt;. With the lock end as the main parameter, veMAV lockers who want to maximize their power must extend their lock frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding wrappers, several existing projects have already expressed their intention of building on top of Maverick or veMAV, including Paladin, SpiralDAO, and StakeDAO. The MAV wars will be vicious, so read the fine print before locking your MAV somewhere else than in the veMAV contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forward-outlook--parting-words&#34;&gt;Forward outlook &amp;amp; parting words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick is currently live on mainnet, zkSync, and BSC. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to remark on how much it dominates the volume on zkSync, even with a fraction of its competitor TVL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/zksync-dex-volume.png&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;zksync-dex-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mainnet, most of the success has been found with ETH-LSDs pairs (wstETH, swETH, etc.) and stablecoins. Maverick&amp;rsquo;s efficient liquidity structure is highly competitive with Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On volatile tokens, LPs are a bit shy still, just like it took a few months for people to get used to the novelty brought in by Uniswap V3. Interestingly, LPs are experimenting more on zkSync, especially on pairs such as ETH/USDC, thanks to the lowered gas costs, leading to an overall capital efficiency even more significant than on mainnet, here are the stats for today (July 06 2023):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap V3 - mainnet: 0.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - mainnet: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - zkSync: 0.93&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started-with-maverick-as-a-user&#34;&gt;Getting started with Maverick as a user
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a learning curve for Maverick, as understanding how to structure liquidity properly can be intimidating because of all the options provided. Yet more options mean more expressivity and, thus, more efficiency and returns when adequately harnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make the most of Maverick as a user and discover the protocol in an environment with low fees, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend supplying your first LPs on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt; - as it will enable you to modify them at a low cost if needed. Like most new DeFi products, the best way to master it is to use it and see it behaves in various market conditions, so get at it: you might also be double-dipping on airdrops so that it can be quite a rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to check out the Boosted Pools, which - in addition to their incentives - have a pre-defined liquidity configuration, making them more accessible to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-managers-its-time-to-wake-up&#34;&gt;Liquidity Managers, it&amp;rsquo;s time to wake up!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the project side, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute necessity for liquidity managers to understand and master Maverick&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s by far the venue delivering the most liquidity efficiency. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them in the process, since it has become a specialty of mine.

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the next few months of the DEX wars will unfold; with Maverick already consistently in the top 5 of Ethereum DEXes by volume processed, I think it&amp;rsquo;s no stretch to envision it breaking into the top 3 by the end of year latest as the veMAV gauges will be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand the paradigm shift that lies with the transition from liquidity mining / basic ve(3,3) to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse implementing vote-directed liquidity shaping. Feel free to follow the events live, monitoring onchain data like as OGs do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solidly/Velodrome forks have been popping up like mushrooms, especially across the popular layer 2 like Arbitrum or zkSync. Solidly is now the top #3 forked protocol in DeFi and one of the rare cases where the forks (such as Velodrome) are the market leaders. At first glance, it could seem like just another fork hype train, like when we had the Uni/Sushi fork season, Olympus fork season, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, it’s overblown: an absurd amount of such DEXes are launching weekly, and 95% of them won’t be relevant six months from now. However, like with most of such hype trains, there is deep down, below the fluff, an actual fundamental innovation in how decentralized exchanges are designed that is worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article will dive deep into the Solidly and Velodrome models to understand why they became a standard fork template. With that said, we’ll be in an excellent position to ponder the next steps for these DEXes and what this market might look like in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get right to it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV Wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-ve33-dexes&#34;&gt;Introduction to ve(3,3) DEXes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how Solidly built on top and tried to improve the veCRV model, let’s take a step back to consider the scope first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amm-structure-vs-incentivization-layer&#34;&gt;AMM Structure VS Incentivization Layer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to grasp the ve(3,3) DEXes story, we need to distinguish between two layers that are equally important for a decentralized exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure layer&lt;/strong&gt;: the various AMM models used to sustain liquidity, such as UNIv2’s x*y=k or Curve’s stableswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;: fees + all other incentives directed to the liquidity provider, including token emissions (such as in the CRV model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the end of the day, 1 – the liquidity structure – is the heart of the game, the second layer – incentives – is crucial in attracting and sustaining sufficient liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve innovated on both. While the models we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss today harnessed it, they &lt;strong&gt;focus entirely on improving the incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed at the current stage, most of ve(3,3) DEXes harnessing the Solidly or Velodrome model only offer two well-known liquidity structure types: x*y=k &amp;amp; stableswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the DEXes, those two liquidity models are called correlated/volatile or stable/volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about what was so interesting about Andre’s Cronje original Solidly and what insights we can draw from its failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;andre-cronjes-solidly-innovations&#34;&gt;Andre Cronje’s Solidly Innovations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in early 2022 on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cronje’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, the crucial part of Solidly’s vision was a significant improvement in the utility for lockers. On Curve, lockers are committed for four years with non-transferable vote-escrowed tokens. While it’s great for the long-term incentives alignment of all the participants of the Curve ecosystem, it also creates a sizable barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus came ve(3,3), with at its core &lt;strong&gt;the veNFT&lt;/strong&gt;. While veCRV are illiquid, veSOLID positions are represented by the veNFT, enabling their transfer or OTC sale/purchase. It helps make locking less scary. To further incentivize it, Cronje introduced “&lt;strong&gt;anti-dilutive rebases&lt;/strong&gt;”, a concept drawn from Ampleforth/Olympus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is simple: since the Curve/Solidly DEX model emits tokens weekly to liquidity providers, vetokens holders are constantly diluted. They must keep increasing their position even to maintain their current vote share. To compensate for this, veSOLID holders receive a weekly rebase proportional to the weekly emissions under the Solidly model. This allows them to maintain their voting share even if no new tokens are locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these changes, Solidly inherited most of the Curve model, including &lt;strong&gt;the LP boost&lt;/strong&gt; feature, enabling vetokens holders to earn boosted yields on their liquidity position. This feature has real consequences since it pretty much “calls for a Convex.” Indeed, the logical conclusion of such a feature is one/a few actors seizing significant amounts of vetokens and providing their LP boost to depositors for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence/absence of this feature is the critical difference between the Solidly and Velodrome models, so we’ll touch back on it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there one last critical twist to the voter incentives model. On Curve, LP get half of the trading fees collected + CRV emissions, while voters have no exposure to the fees of the pool they are voting on. It can lead to situation where voters are voting for pools just for the bribes, even if the pool provides no volume to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Solidly, the LPs are only rewarded with SOLID emission, and the LP fees are redirected to the voters of the pool. Thus, as a veSOLID holder, to optimize your earnings, you are incentivized to consider the volume on the pool you are voting on, and not just the bribes. This leads to a better alignment of the incentives of the main participants of the protocol (swapper, liquidity provider, veHolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly also innovated on the launch strategy, with &lt;strong&gt;an airdrop targeted at protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their onchain activity on Fantom, where Solidly was. Together, all those innovations and the hype led to a massive amount of liquidity quickly attracted to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Solidly’s initial implementation had a few key weaknesses, including an aggressively steep decline in emissions and fully permissionless gauge creation that allowed any pools to receive SOLID rewards. It was gamable, so it was gamed. Soon, tokens were created for the sole purpose of farming SOLID, and the price quickly spiraled, along with the TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/solidly-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cover-image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TVL disappeared as quickly as it came, and Solidly became a part of history for most. But those who followed the events closely knew that Solidly’s failure did not come from a weakness in the ve(3,3) model but more of &lt;strong&gt;an overlooked detail of its implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that while Solidly was no more, ve(3,3) would likely resurface. And it did, a few months later, on another chain made by another team: enter Velodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;velodromes-refinements-to-the-solidly-model&#34;&gt;Velodrome’s refinements to the Solidly model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; harnessed the Solidly model and fixed the issue with emissions by implementing a &lt;strong&gt;whitelist for gauges&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to avoid the situation where rewards are allocated to made-up tokens, as seen on Solidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome went far beyond a mere fork, though, and implemented further improvements; among them were a more sustainable emissions model and &lt;strong&gt;removing the LP boost feature&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning there is no preferential treatment for veVELO holders in terms of yield. Velodrome also streamlines the experience for first-time LPs who might be confused with the yield range you see on DEXes with LP boost implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical features, a large part of Velodrome’s success is due to the &lt;strong&gt;team’s execution and care for the business development strategies&lt;/strong&gt;, an essential part of the ve(3,3) model. Built on Optimism, Velodrome found its PMF as the chain liquidity layer. Thanks to its model, sustaining liquidity on Velodrome is much more cost-effective for projects than, say, on Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Solidly, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome airdropped several protocols with a veVELO NFT,&lt;/strong&gt; no strings attached, which helped immensely to attract the initial voting and bribing activity. The protocol found a good fit, mostly with other protocols emitting stablecoins or ETH liquid stake derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/defiwars-velodrome.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defiwars-velodrome&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost a year, and the activity has sustained, thanks to careful and progressive adjustments of the &lt;strong&gt;OP incentives allocated on the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/tour-de-op-updates-631268181baa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tour de OP&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are used to incentivize two behaviors essential to sustain the flywheel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes from protocols, incentivized by OP bribes matching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking of veVELO, incentivized by an OP lock bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribe matching is further increased for projects which lock veVELO or deploy sizeable amounts of protocol-owned liquidity to the exchange, helping further amplify the reinforcing effect: those who want to build liquidity sustained over the long term on Velodrome have been given solid reasons to buy VELO, lock and vote, bribe, and supply POL, &lt;strong&gt;ideally all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to Velodrome topping the protocols TVL charts on Optimism and processing about 30% of the total volume of the chain vs 50% for Uniswap, which has roughly ¼ of Velodrome’s TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/optimism-volume.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;optimism-DEX-volume&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why such a spread between the both? Simple: Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s Volume/TVL ratio is ~9x above Velodrome right now because the liquidity on Uniswap is much more concentrated and thus more efficient. But it’s about to change as Velodrome V2 is arriving soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-velodrome-v2&#34;&gt;Introducing Velodrome V2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap had a headstart with concentrated liquidity, it will change rapidly. The v3 license &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/governance/liscense-modifications&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;expired on April 1st 2023&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the model is now much easier to re-implement. Many DEXes, including Solidly/Velodrome forks, intend to harness this. Still, to keep this article focused, we’ll only cover what is announced for Velodrome V2, expected in the next few weeks/months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Velodrome V2 will not just mark &lt;strong&gt;the introduction of UNI-v3 style of LP on the DEX&lt;/strong&gt; but also significant UX/UI improvements, a relayer to ease the management of veNFT, artwork for the veNFT, and much more. Check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-road-ah-43488531bb0e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;V2 announcement article&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you understand the benefits of the Solidly and Velodrome models. While I mention the myriad of forks in the introduction, I’ve stayed on course with this article. I guess this calls for a follow-up where I comb through their main forks and the modifications they implement into the template: stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Business Development&lt;/strong&gt; | ve(3,3), just like Curve, are protocols for protocols. The team&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and ability to efficiently prioritize and executive on BD is a sizable success factor of the DEX over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the launch/airdrop/top racers rooster&lt;/strong&gt; | Even if BD is done well, a given ve(3,3) DEX is only as good as its top racers. Yes, you want them bribing, voting, and driving awareness, but not only. The quality of the liquidity driven to the DEX also matters (volume/TVL ratio).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LP Boost and its consequences&lt;/strong&gt; | If a ve(3,3) implements LP boost, it calls for Convex-like protocols. The success of the ve(3,3) will be impacted by how much and how well its Convex-likes do. To follow the key stats on the various wrappers and main veTokens holders, check - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiWars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ve(3,3) + Liquidity Concentration&lt;/strong&gt; | While ve(3,3) is a significant innovation for the incentives layer of the DEX, it currently harnesses sub-par liquidity structures. Properly matching the ve(3,3) incentives model with an efficient UNIv3-style liquidity structure will help further improve the effectiveness of the flywheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex </title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/curve-wars-l2-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game and the fight around CRV and CVX tokens have changed in scope since my last article describing the original Curve Wars, now almost primitive. The infrastructure around Curve has become much denser with the arrival of Convex of course, but also Votium, Union Llama Airforce, Concentrator, CCRV, Lendflare, Warden, and many other protocols still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume a strategic position on CRV or CVX, one must now be able to support an investment of several tens of millions of dollars. Thus, the race to accumulate CVX and CRV has become primarily a game for DAOs or whales. More specifically, DAOs seem to prefer CVX to CRV, which represents a more favorable trade-off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosts LP Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: ability to build liquidity via votes on Curve gauges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yields&lt;/strong&gt;: 4-5% in cvxCRV + potential bribe yields if capacity is not used (or the protocol also use bribes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;: CVX can be used to its maximum capacity by committing 16 weeks + 3 days (vlCVX) while CRV requires up to 4 years of commitment (1 CRV = veCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to extract the utility of CRV, CVX is a credible and more flexible alternative, which is why most DAOs focus on this token. Convex Finance has become a &amp;ldquo;functional L2&amp;rdquo; of Curve: a second layer that brings new features and a different set of tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Convex is not the only project that tried to realize this vision: there was also Yearn, which has now capitulated: Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Curve vaults are essentially through Convex, which is now more profitable. Since then, many projects are trying to offer a synergistic brick with the Curve/Convex behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crv-or-cvx&#34;&gt;CRV or CVX?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the basics of the separation between the two tokens here, that&amp;rsquo;s a matter for an entire article if you&amp;rsquo;re new to the subject: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence the Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be kept in mind that despite the computable equivalence between CVX and CRV (1vl CVX controls about 4.8 veCRV - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/Marcov/Convex-Finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), the two tokens have different tradeoffs as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between CRV and CVX tends to hold, despite frequent swings: lately, the pendulum seems to swing more towards CVX. Nevertheless I think there is still room for other approaches that start from the source (CRV) and they are starting to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paladin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing a protocol that helps liquidity providers on Curve maximize their returns and perhaps achieve the desirable 2.5x bonus by borrowing the capacity of veCRV tokens (provided by others) paid directly in CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are so many other subtleties and interactions to keep in mind in order to understand the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects, DAOs and protocols to win the Curve Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why this article proposes to review the CRV and CVX wars &lt;strong&gt;by visualizing and detailing the whole ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; that has developed around these two protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an image to describe this trend of multiplication of supports used to interact with Curve/Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to confuse the term with &amp;ldquo;true L2s&amp;rdquo; / scaling L2s: the term in its original sense to describe a new chain that inherits the security of its parent while allowing for higher transaction throughput and more moderate costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we start with Curve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Functional L2s&lt;/strong&gt;, then Convex&amp;rsquo;s (itself a Curve L2), then borrowing services to leverage the many sources of return offered by the entire Curve ecosystem, and we&amp;rsquo;ll finish with the CRV/CVX protocol-whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a dense and colorful adventure, but as is often the case with my articles, I&amp;rsquo;m offering you a summary of my research on the subject: enjoy your reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lose you on the way, I propose you this map which summarizes the main actors of the Curve/Convex ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/curve-convex-l2-map-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Curve/Convex L2 map&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convex-finance-curve-by-the-slice&#34;&gt;Convex Finance: Curve by the slice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is the first functional L2 of Curve; other projects preceded it (yveCRV and sdveCRV) but they were not as synergistic with Curve and therefore only marginally successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Convex provides access to maximized and liquid CRV token returns through cvxCRV. The ability to govern and vote on the Curve gauges corresponding to the underlying veCRV tokens is redirected to the owners of vlCVX. Convex thus provides easy access to the Curve ecosystem (for veCRV owners).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Convex controls a large amount of vlCVX, the centralization of voting power on gauges is avoided by offering this capability to the highest bidder through Votium (bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex is now basic, so I won&amp;rsquo;t detail it further here. My previous article on CRV Warfare went into more depth on the model and the contributions of Convex: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV Warfare: Understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warden-of-paladin-curve-on-steroids&#34;&gt;Warden of Paladin: Curve on steroids?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is another possible path for Curve LPs, which offers a different set of tradeoffs to Convex. Warden does not directly control veCRVs, but instead offers to rent the boosting capacity of LP Curve from veCRVs owned by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental is paid directly in CRVs and by the week. It comes from veCRV owners who make it available, for the price and duration of their choice. The deal is concluded through the delegation of the corresponding veCRVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-veboost.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LP Ve boost rental on Warden&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden thus returns to the LP Curve boost game. On Convex, most pools are boosted between 1.5 and 1.7x via Convex. Having your own stock of veCRV, increased by a Warden loan, allows you to reach 2x or even 2.5x maximum on certain pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Warden even offers a handy calculator to visualize the amount of veCRV needed to reach a given multiplier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-calc.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Warden Calculator&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden is therefore a credible alternative for protocols, DAOs and large carriers who would like to optimize their LP Curve in a perspective of maximizing the obtained CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;l2-convex&#34;&gt;L2 Convex
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is not yet one year old (May 2021) but given the preponderant place that the service already occupies, abstractions built on top of it were quick to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-convex-vote-auction&#34;&gt;Votium: Convex vote auction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Convex protocol concentrates the largest amount of veCRVs owned by a single entity. Nevertheless, the voting capacity corresponding to the veCRVs owned by Convex (obtained thanks to the cvxCRV) is distributed among all the owners of the CVX token that &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; it (vlCVX) for 16 weeks + 7 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via snapshot, they can mobilize their voting power directly on the Curve pool gauge of their choice. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt; is an additional layer built on top of this feature: Votium allows any project to allocate a budget to support a given Curve gauge. At the end of the round, the vlCVX owners who voted on this gauge share the rewards, according to their voting power: these are the famous bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/votium-bribes.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Votium bribes&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the impressive amount of veCRVs controlled by Convex, Votium has quickly emerged as &lt;strong&gt;an essential tool to establish and sustain a presence on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: consistent bribes on Votium can quickly make a Curve pool very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detail below the example of Frax Finance which offers around $5-7M of bribes each round; this allows to maintain attractive returns on the Frax/3CRV pool despite the massive dilution (the pool contains almost $3B of assets), and this without issuing their own token (FXS) for liquidity mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;llama-airforce-union-shared-management-of-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Llama Airforce Union: shared management of vlCVX
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bribes offered on Votium are very attractive: this allows vlCVX to reach a return &lt;strong&gt;of about 40% APR - most of which (90%) comes from the bribes&lt;/strong&gt;. However, managing your own vlCVX position has several constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas costs&lt;/strong&gt;, to lock in your vlCVX, but also to harvest the bribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is possible to delegate, this leads to a dispersion of the rewards (paid in a dozen different tokens -&amp;gt; gas fees). So small and medium vlCVX holders generally prefer to concentrate their vote on a given project: more practical, but it implies not forgetting to &lt;strong&gt;vote at each round&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Llama Airforce Union proposes to remedy these two main limitations, for the happiness of small holders as well as those who prefer a &lt;strong&gt;100% passive management of their vlCVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple: the Union pools the management of vlCVX. The only action required from the users is the delegation of their vlCVX voting power to the Union contract. Thereafter, the Union takes care of everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each round, the Union takes care of claiming all the obtained bribes, and sells them for cvxCRV (=mutualization/immense reduction of the impact of transaction fees).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obtained cvxCRV are then deposited in the Pounder, which stakes them with Convex and composes the yield automatically (uCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union thus offers a relevant alternative for CVX owners who intend to maintain and compound their position over the long term. As always, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to pay attention to the fees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas fees are passed on and distributed to all Union users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fee of 2% of the total bribes received is also charged in each round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This TVL only takes into account the yields of the bribes compounded into cvxCRVs by the Union (uCRV). The vlCVX are not taken into account since they are simply delegated to the Union (about 2.5M CVX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Union has been a rapid success. The project originated from the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://llama.airforce/#/convex/flyer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Llama Airforce&lt;/a&gt;, an already well-known source of information within the Curve/Convex ecosystem, which no doubt contributed to its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;concentrator-aladdindao&#34;&gt;Concentrator (AladdinDAO)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://concentrator.aladdin.club/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Concentrator&lt;/a&gt; is a bit like the Union, but this time for liquidity providers. Thus the Concentrator proposes to manage LP Curve for its depositors: the rewards (CRV, CVX and potential other tokens) are automatically sold for cvxCRV and automatically composed (staking on Convex) via the aCRV wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is interesting and rather synergistic with Curve and Convex: it&amp;rsquo;s a bit unfortunate to see that CVX are sold for the moment, but explained by the lack of available wrapper for vlCVX. The service offered by Concentrator is therefore rather relevant for &lt;strong&gt;small and medium sized carriers who want to use their LP Curve to maximize their CRV&lt;/strong&gt; token exposure in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;congruent-ccrv-curveconvex-flywheel-optimization&#34;&gt;Congruent CCRV: Curve/Convex flywheel optimization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the current limitations of Convex (or feature for some) is that despite the fairly dense liquidity in the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool, it is often unbalanced. CvxCRV is liquid against CRV, but rarely at 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccrv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCRV&lt;/a&gt; is therefore designed as a mechanism to help rebalance this pool, using both Curve and Convex. The principle is quite simple if you understand the mechanisms of Curve and Convex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/ccrv.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the cCRV token, backed by 1 cvxCRV. The protocol stakes all the cvxCRVs deposited to back cCRVs in Convex, in order to obtain a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the Curve 3CRV pool: CRV, cvxCRV and cCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes on the 3CRV pool to help it grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism will launch with an initial allocation of 1M CRV (provided by Congruent DAO). This will airdrop 1M cCRV (via bribes) over the first few weeks of the token&amp;rsquo;s existence to help it launch quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the launch plan seems pretty solid, the sustainability of the mechanism still seems uncertain. The addition of fees could allow the CCRV protocol to have its own liquidity (and therefore return in CRV, CVX and 3 pool) which could fuel the bribes while reducing their effective cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cCRV is not yet launched but is intended to be a &lt;strong&gt;new optimization of the flywheel Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, cCRV is being developed by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://congruent.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Congruent&lt;/a&gt;, a DAO that develops &amp;ldquo;Governance as a Service&amp;rdquo; (GaaS) products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bent-the-convex-of-convex&#34;&gt;Bent: the Convex of Convex?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.bentfinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bent&lt;/a&gt; is a true L2 Convex / L3 of Curve. The main question that arises with this project is whether there is anything to gain by going down to this level of depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, Bent works like Convex works for Curve: Bent allows you to stake Curve LP tokens: they are then staked in Convex (by Bent), and you benefit from an additional return paid with their native token - BENT, in exchange for fees collected by Bent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bentfinance-fees.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Bentfinance-fees&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may notice, the fee structure is almost identical to Convex. Finally, just as Convex created its own representation of CRV (cvxCRV), Bent creates its representation of CVX, the bentCVX. This can also be locked (weBENT) exactly like CVX-&amp;gt;vlCVX, for 8 weeks to get an additional yield corresponding to the bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks (Curve gauge round), weBENT holders vote on Snapshot to allocate their voting capacity on the gauges of their choice. The votes of the weBENT holders are echoed via the CVX owned by BentFinance, themselves echoed in CRV vote by Convex: two levels of depth!&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bentCVX-lock.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-relevant-abstraction&#34;&gt;A relevant abstraction?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said when discussing Bent, the question here is not whether the model is relevant since Convex is living proof of that. Nevertheless, Convex is not a zero-sum game compared to Curve, since the protocol has brought new features that did not exist with just Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farm with LP Curve optimized, without having veCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Liquid Locking&amp;rdquo; (⚠ cvxCRV/CRV exchange rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the third point which is a bit of a consequence of the other two: Convex is now the biggest veCRV owner, and can therefore offer the bribe service (via Votium) with the most potential while being the most convenient (delegation, no need to claim every week, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I detail the contributions of Convex, it is obviously to ask the question: what does Bent bring &lt;strong&gt;functionally&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Convex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming option with LP Curve without owning a veCRV even more optimized than Convex, but all the outperformance comes from the BENT emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less restrictive locking of CVX than direct locking via vlCVX (8 weeks at Bent, 16 weeks + 7 days at Convex)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the third element is still missing to make Bent an interesting option, a mechanism that would create a real added value compared to Curve/Convex, in addition to farm optimization and a reduction of constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would be dishonest if I did not add one last point: the security and durability of the protocol. Indeed, Bent Finance has been attacked by an insider in December 2021 for several weeks. The attack was made possible by the fact that at that time, Bent&amp;rsquo;s contracts were not secured by a multisig: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://halborn.com/explained-the-bent-finance-hack-december-2021/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more information here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conic-finance-cnc--collective-liquidity-management-on-curveconvex&#34;&gt;Conic Finance (CNC) 🚧: collective liquidity management on Curve/Convex.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚧 reports a protocol not yet launched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Bent, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ConicFinance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Conic&lt;/a&gt; offers an additional abstraction from Curve LPs staked on Convex. However I think that this time the model has relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic introduces the concept of &amp;ldquo;omnipools&amp;rdquo;, which would simplify the management for Curve LPs by going back to the primitive level: here, it is directly the tokens that are deposited (e.g. USDC or DAI). The Conic omnipools will then distribute the tokens on different LP Curve positions which are then staked on Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depositors receive their CRV, CVX and CNC tokens from Conic. In a similar way to CVX, the CNC can be &amp;ldquo;vote locked&amp;rdquo; to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in bi-weekly gauge votes that determine the distribution of Curve pools by assets accepted on Conic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote on the whitelist and blacklist of accepted Curve pools (and thus eligible for gauges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in the vote to decide which assets are supported on Conic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other governance decisions, including the potential activation of fees for the service (initially there will be none).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic&amp;rsquo;s approach thus seems relevant and could be described as pooled asset management. It is a model reminiscent of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokemak.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tokemak&lt;/a&gt; and goes one step further than Curve/Convex which remains at the level of governance determination of incitations. Here, governance votes will result in the actual movement of assets between different Curve pools. If the protocol manages to attract sufficient liquidity, it could become a major player in the Curve Wars, potentially with its own bribe system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has just been unveiled and the approach being considered for launch is also interesting. Part of the CNC supply will be airdropped to vlCVX owners. For the rest, it will be distributed with community fundraising, liquidity mining on CNC/ETH and to depositors on Conic. To learn more, there is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ConicFinance/conic-finance-pre-launch-announcement-7b9f485f59f2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only one article available for now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;borrowing-services-with-lp-curveconvex-tokens-as-collateral&#34;&gt;Borrowing services with LP Curve/Convex tokens as collateral
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may start to get saturated just by mentioning a new potential wrapper on CRV, CVX or even cvxCRV: this is probably normal. Most of the protocols involved in the Curve Wars develop synergies directly at the token level, which remains the most direct. But we should not forget two other important types of actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols offering a synergistic service with the Curve/Convex LP, such as using it as collateral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols / DAOs that have large amounts of CVX and CRV and can use them to develop a strategic position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going to the whales and their strategies, I offer you two last analyses of protocols that allow you to borrow from an LP Curve position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lendflare-lft&#34;&gt;Lendflare (LFT)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lendflare.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lendflare&lt;/a&gt; allows Curve LPs to borrow from their position an asset that follows the same peg, for example a DAI borrow with the LP 3pool token (USDC/DAI/USDT) as collateral. This limitation avoids liquidations due to price changes between assets: with Lendflare as long as a borrower pays back his debt on or before the due date he is not liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical point, as with any money market, is to attract enough depositors to make borrowing as cheap as possible and therefore competitive. Lendflare follows the logic of Curve&amp;rsquo;s boosts: users who bring in cash (USDC, DAI, ETH or wBTC) to facilitate borrowing are rewarded with the LFT token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on Curve, here they can also benefit from a multiplier of up to 2.5x by locking in a quantity of LFT (veLFT) proportional to the deposit. There is even a very dense diagram that summarizes everything and will make you appreciate the special care I put into my home-made infographics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/lendflare.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LendFlare&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol is still in the midst of deployment, although the borrowing functionality is already available. An initial sale (IDO) of the LFT token is underway, and an airdrop is also being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curvance-cve-&#34;&gt;Curvance (CVE) 🚧
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curvance tackles the same problem but with a different approach. Here the protocol is not interested in Curve LPs as collateral, but rather &amp;ldquo;wrapped assets&amp;rdquo; in general like cvxCRV, bveCVX (Badger) or yvBOOST (Yearn). To enable the borrowing of stablecoins with these assets as collateral, they plan to isolate the risk by relying on Fuse pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the CVE token will be distributed to liquidity providers and a veCVE-like system is envisioned with a new subtlety: yet another wrap, a liquid version of the veCVE, the cveCVE that gives access to the veCVE&amp;rsquo;s yield but delegates governance capabilities to the DAO. Again, boosts, gauges, and even potentially bribes are envisioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the curious, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.curvance.com/cve/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;documentation is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daos-whales-in-cvx&#34;&gt;DAOs whales in CVX
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish this overview of the Curve/Convex ecosystem, we should not forget to look directly at the tokens - and in particular the DAOs that have large amounts of CRV or CVX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For CRV, there is not yet a clear dashboard summarizing the situation to my knowledge. For CVX on the other hand, there is a site for that: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;Daocvx.com&#34; &gt;daocvx.com&lt;/a&gt;. The protocols we will detail now do not have any synergy built natively with Curve or Convex, but they have a lot of CVX and use them to improve their competitive position in the CRV war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/daocvx.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;daocvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you dig through the list on your own, we&amp;rsquo;ll just detail two: Frax and Badger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frax-finance-dominating-the-curve-gauge-game&#34;&gt;Frax Finance: Dominating the Curve Gauge Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frax has a long-standing strategy of dominating the Curve Gauge game to help drive FRAX adoption. It was one of the first DAOs to gain a consistent position in CVX; it is now the DAO with the &lt;strong&gt;largest position with over 2.1M CVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frax is also known to be the most aggressive project with bribes and frequently offers the largest Votium bribe for its FRAX/3crv pool. In the last round (14), Frax&amp;rsquo;s bribe was about &lt;strong&gt;40% of the total value of all bribes&lt;/strong&gt; paid in that round ($6.5M / $16.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Frax can afford to be so aggressive is that their vlCVX position reduces the effective cost of these bribes: thanks to their own votes, the protocol is able to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x090777069299e6e292363c6131b5cc5b463d598a7f89d3c7207148c0497587f8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recover&lt;/a&gt; a significant portion of the FXS used in each round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this strategy, the FRAX/3CRV pool is able to &lt;strong&gt;maintain a CRV issuance rate almost five times higher than the 3pool, for a similar total liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; (3pool: $3.3B, FRAX: $2.7B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;badger-a-small-corner-for-bitcoin&#34;&gt;Badger: a small corner for Bitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Badger has focused on optimizing farming with BTC on Ethereum. Initially, before Convex, Badger worked closely with Yearn, but with the launch of Convex and its rapid dominance, Badge&amp;rsquo;s position has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Frax, Badger did not buy its CVX. Instead, Badger is developing a model similar to Convex&amp;rsquo;s to accumulate CRV under control; the bveCVX vault. It offers a similar return to direct locking on Convex, but includes itself in the Badger ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bveCVX scales contribute to Badger&amp;rsquo;s internal boost system that is effective on most vaults. In addition, in each round the BadgerDAO uses the corresponding bveCVX voting power to support the Curve pools supported in Badger, which are essentially pools that involve one or more variants of wBTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than acquiring its position in CVX, Badger is able to obtain control of CVX tokens thanks to incentives - so it&amp;rsquo;s a sort of CVX rental. There is also a Curve bveCVX/CVX pool to allow early exit from the vault. There are now almost 1.7M CVX in the vault, so the strategy has proven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-daos&#34;&gt;Other DAOs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I focused on two projects that develop two very distinct strategies to accumulate CVX and weigh in on the Curve Wars. As you can see on the graph above, there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protocol develops a substantial position on CVX (say &amp;gt;300K CVX), it benefits directly from its tokens, especially in terms of liquidity. Nevertheless it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there: large CVX owners are in a strategic position and will also be courted very soon for different partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already see the mechanics at work, with the discussion around a potential 4pool (USDC/USDT/FRAX/UST), made possible thanks to the combined influences of Frax, Luna, Redacted and Olympus. The CVX protocols-whales thus become interfaces for the Curve Wars, it remains to be seen who will be able to make them the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/curve-wars-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of Curve Finance and the launch of the CRV token, we have been waiting, contemplating and assuming what the CRV war could bring. Now, with the launch of Convex, then Bribe.crv and finally Votium, everything is accelerating: VeCRV votes can now be bought! So let&amp;rsquo;s see how this impacts Curve and DeFi as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the question is quite simple and straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve is the largest decentralized DeFi exchange in terms of total value deposited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CRV token provides access to 1/ a share of the fees collected 2/ &lt;strong&gt;a voting power to influence the issuance of future CRVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;=&amp;gt; Having control over a large CRV voting power makes it &lt;strong&gt;much easier to develop a Curve pool&lt;/strong&gt;, since it offers the possibility to vote for large CRV returns on the pool in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as often in DeFi, everything is not so simple and the devil is in the details. To understand the stakes of the CRV war, you need to have &lt;strong&gt;a good understanding of the different tools built on it&lt;/strong&gt;. This will allow you to judge the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects that seek to influence Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convex-and-the-vecrv-separation&#34;&gt;Convex and the VeCRV separation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing the battlefields - i.e. the different tools used in this CRV war - we need to look more deeply at one in particular: Convex. I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it on this blog, explaining &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-flywheel.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the flywheel dimension of Convex with the CvxCRV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions of Convex with Curve go far beyond the CvxCRV, which is only one element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;strong&gt;one could describe Convex as a separation between governance and returns on VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; by amplifying each of the elements on a separate token. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cvxcrv--vecrv-yield&#34;&gt;CvxCRV = VeCRV-yield++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a VeCRV owned by Convex. They are locked in forever, but the liquidity available on CvxCRV/CRV allows depositors to close out their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of governance, CvxCRV loses all its capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; : VeCRV owner can vote on gauges (CRV issue) and governance votes. A CvxCRV owner has no other benefit than the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;the return is amplified compared to a simple possession of VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in 3pool token - the share of fees collected on Curve - exactly like VeCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in CRV (10% of all CRV farmed by Convex shared between all CvxCRV stakers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually the same yield in CVX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential airdrops like Ellipsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a simple compromise compared to VeCRV: governance capabilities are lost (-&amp;gt; vlCVX) but in return the performance is greatly amplified and diversified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vlcvx--vecrv-gov&#34;&gt;vlCVX = VeCRV-gov++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Convex offers another interesting abstraction from Curve. It is its native CVX token. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;each CVX corresponds to a VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; voting capability (which comes from CvxCRV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mobilize it, the depositor must &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; his CVX in vlCVX. They are locked for 16 weeks + 3 days and so provide access to governance capacity. Currently, vlCVX is by far the most economically efficient way to accrue Curve voting capacity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Price
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Voting power
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV-vote/$
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Commitment
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$2.42
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1 veCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;0.41
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 years
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;vlCVX
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$8.2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;12,75 VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1.55
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;16 weeks + 3 days
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increased profitability of CVX to influence Curve, the commitment is also less than on VeCRV. For the comparison table, I assumed a 4-year lock on CRV. The difference is even more in favor of vlCVX for shorter commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to further analyze the returns offered by the delegation of CVX and the associated vote buying, feel free to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@portiadog/convex-finance-1cc6c9c1c733&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribes-a-not-so-clean-separation&#34;&gt;Bribes: a not so clean separation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation was clear, but it did not remain so for long. Indeed, it should first be noted that vlCVX is not without returns: &lt;strong&gt;vlCVX owners share 6% of all CRVs farmed by Convex, in the form of CvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this is potentially not the only return for which vlCVX owners are eligible. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;governance capacity can also offer a substantial return via bribe mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; (vote buying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different projects offer incentives for voting on the gauge of a given Pool Curve. For example, Alchemix offers rewards in ALCX, its native token, which can be claimed each week by all those who used their VeCRV to vote to increase the CRV allocation of the AlUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, it is not impossible that the initial separation planned by Convex is not the most honest. Currently, the yield on cvxCRV is about 60% while it is only 15% on CVX. Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;when you add the bribes into the equation, it is not impossible that the yield on vlCVX is much higher than on cvxCRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-battlefields&#34;&gt;The battlefields
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bribes&amp;rdquo; services are an essential part of the Curve governance equation. However, before digging into them, we need to recall the basic path (veCRV) that defines the framework for all its variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeCRV is obtained by locking CRV for up to 4 years. The longer the lock, the closer the VeCRV/CRV ratio is to 1. &lt;strong&gt;The lock gradually depletes over time as does the voting capacity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why vaults built on VeCRV operate on a 4-year perpetual locking logic: in order to preserve a voting capacity that is always as close to the maximum possible, &lt;strong&gt;they &amp;ldquo;refresh&amp;rdquo; the locking frequently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribe-v0--direct-incentive-on-pools&#34;&gt;Bribe v0 : direct incentive on pools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about bribes, it is worth remembering there is a primitive form that has been available since the early days of Curve: additional incentives (on top of CRVs) for liquidity providers. Synthetix pioneered this with the SNX liquidity mining program on the sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct incentives can be combined with bribes, and are even recommended. We will see below how MIM, for example, obtained much more activity by sharing its budget between incentives and bribes (after an initial phase without bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribecrv-by-cronje-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Bribe.crv by Cronje [with veCRV]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &amp;ldquo;bribes&amp;rdquo; are purchases of VeCRV votes. They are paid by the week, generally on Friday (the day the votes are taken into account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just as there are several systems for interacting with VeCRV, there are also several mechanisms for bribes. So we start with the one that was available first: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bribe.crv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://bribe.crv.finance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic unit is the VeCRV. Bribe.crv is a simple interface that summarizes the different offers and allows to collect its bribes. Voting is done directly on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a somewhat timid start, the service is being used more and more and many projects are now proposing bribes. The returns in the first few weeks have been excellent, it remains to be seen if they will last. For example, I got &lt;strong&gt;about 10% return on my VeCRV (/ current price) in 5 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; by voting for the MIM pool and receiving SPELL tokens in bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to the results below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-with-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Votium [with vlCVX]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative available is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the basic unit is the vlCVX, so the two services are not competitors but complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Votium is more recent so the available bribes are more limited. On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;Votium already controls an impressive voting power: about 8M CVX or more than 102M VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is potentially more passive than with bribe.crv since depositors can delegate to Votium who will take care of voting each week for them and collect the corresponding bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with an active delegation, a depositor can at any time take back control and vote for a given pool, directly on snapshot (-&amp;gt; no gas cost). The system is therefore more flexible than bribe.crv in this respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services to handle bribes are also in development with a release in the near future. So far the bribe game has focused mainly on CRV, but &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.paladin.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, intends to offer a similar mechanism with other protocols as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-into-practice-tactics-and-results&#34;&gt;Putting it into practice: tactics and results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual bases are a bit heavy on this subject, but it is essential to understand them. To make it more explicit, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the practical side with concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spellmim-case&#34;&gt;The Spell/MIM case
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://abracadabra.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Abracadabra&lt;/a&gt; is a Maker service. Various assets are accepted as collateral, including productive assets such as xSUSHI or cvx3pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Maker produces DAI, Abracadabra produces a stablecoin (on the dollar) called MIM. The liquidity available on MIM, as well as the opportunity for returns, is therefore a key factor in the platform&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Abracadabra has progressively gone through all forms of direct or indirect bribes on Curve :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It started with a SPELL incentive (governance token) on the Curve/MIM pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When bribe.crv arrived, &lt;strong&gt;a portion of that incentive was reallocated to bribe&lt;/strong&gt; - thus distributed to veCRV owners who vote for the MIM gauge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, with the arrival of vlCVX, the team is considering reallocating the budget through this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, the MIM pool has exploded on Curve, at all levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV yields were really good in some weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has attracted liquidity and volume, slightly reducing the yield but increasing the ability to boost the pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result of this momentum, MIM is now the fifth largest pool curve in terms of volume, with a nice volume/TVL ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/crv-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pool is now well balanced and rather dense (&amp;gt; $700M total liquidity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example of Abracadabra is extremely instructive, as it demonstrates the relevance of the abstractions built on VeCRV: &lt;strong&gt;without increasing its total budget, Abracadabra has been able to attract much more liquidity than at the time of the simple direct incentive in SPELL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You therefore understand that DeFi projects that take advantage of the veCRV, cvxCRV and vlCVX mechanisms have an undeniable advantage (&lt;strong&gt;economic AND political&lt;/strong&gt;) over those who have not yet grasped all their subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sdvecrv-vs-cvxcrv&#34;&gt;sdveCRV VS cvxCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;I now consider understanding Curve and the ability to effectively influence its governance to be an essential and required capability in most DeFi projects, especially for stablecoin projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to take my word for it though, let&amp;rsquo;s compare in practice two approaches implemented by projects with similar issues: liquidity strategies on cvxCRV (from Convex) and sdveCRV (from StakeDAO) - two abstractions built on veCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the situations are similar, there are some important differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by recalling that Convex controls more than 30 times the amount of CRV controlled by Stake (102M vs 3M).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, sdveCRV has serious problems with its peg: 1 sdveCRV ~= 0.5 CRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/sdvecrv-peg.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;sdvecrv-peg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sdvecrv-liquidity-plan-total-misunderstanding-and-abject-failure&#34;&gt;sdveCRV liquidity plan: total misunderstanding and abject failure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the analysis. Initially the liquidity of sdveCRV was against ETH just like Yearn. Since Convex, the Stake team is trying to react to make sdveCRV more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team clearly did not take the time to analyze the situation and rushed into what turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;one of the biggest governance failures ever seen on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating an anemic sdveCRV/CRV pool via the Curve Factory, a vote was taken to add the gauge control (= CRV incentives). Not only was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/83&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the vote overwhelmingly rejected&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;the sdveCRV pool is set up in an aberrant and absolutely dangerous way for depositors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the factor A (amplification parameter) of the pool is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/34&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;set to 200&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a correct value for assets that follow the same peg, but &lt;strong&gt;delusional if one asset is worth twice the other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea, even the aforementioned absolutely massive MIM pool (7000x the liquidity of the sdveCRV pool) has not yet reached 200 of A factor (119 currently, increasing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, not only did Stake fail to solve its liquidity problem on sdveCRV, but &lt;strong&gt;such a course of events clearly raises the question of the Stake team&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the intricacies of Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get sdveCRV back to peg and develop its liquidity, they will need a lot of effort, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the pool parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct incentives in SDT on the pool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these steps are completed, the team would then have a chance to get the CRV gauge on this pool, but not before. So the current situation looks like a costly dead end: &lt;strong&gt;no way out unless the SDT board is heated (even more)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cvxcrv-liquidity-plan-immediate-take-off&#34;&gt;cvxCRV liquidity plan: immediate take-off
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the liquidity plan on cvxCRV demonstrates how effective the process can be. Initially (and still today), the main pool for cvxCRV is on Sushiswap, against CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation does not really make sense: &lt;strong&gt;Sushi is far from optimal for optimizing liquidity across assets that follow the same peg&lt;/strong&gt;. So when Curve launched factory pools (V2), the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cvxCRV/CRV pool&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note here the A Factor at 50 - while cvxCRV holds its peg much better than sdveCRV&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any incentive from Convex or Curve, the pool has already seen significant volume flow through DEX aggregators like Paraswap. Soon, there was a vote to add the CRV gauge which passed - and this pool is now farmable directly through Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool remains slightly unbalanced (there is so much to do with CRVs, which are becoming increasingly rare&amp;hellip;) but it already brings a competitive alternative to the SLP cvxCRV/CRV pool with still a fraction of its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you grasp the intricacies of the extended veCRV ecosystem and their implications for the CRV battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before concluding, I would like to remind you that as usual the alpha is in the nooks and crannies. If you have understood this article, feel free to export the liquidity strategy analysis to other projects: I am sure it will be instructive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you often, but it will never be enough: not only Curve is the most important DEX in DeFi but it is also &lt;strong&gt;the most advanced protocol in terms of governance and tokenomics by far compared to anything else&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you have no interest in Curve/Convex, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand these protocols in order to properly consider what&amp;rsquo;s going on in DeFi&amp;hellip; Hopefully this article will help you!&lt;/p&gt;
