        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Money 101 - Discarding the myth of bartering to understand Bitcoin better" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is a critical element of our modern societies: a slight change in its mechanisms can have a much broader impact than simply affecting the economy. Therefore, a better comprehension of these mechanisms will give you a better grasp on various topics ranging from Political Economy to cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a complex subject, even more lately if we consider all the &lt;strong&gt;convoluted systems and protocols&lt;/strong&gt; that were progressively built on top of it: monetary creation, central banks, inflation… With this piece, we’ll go back to the basics and eventually down to cryptocurrencies: What defines a currency? Why do we need them? What types of currencies do exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up for a quite an adventure in which we discard old but still prevalent tales and propose necessary new ones to make complex mechanisms crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-the-origins-ofmoney&#34;&gt;The Tale of the Origins of Money
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear about currencies, you often get a tale that is easy to understand and compelling; yet it’s just a tale. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we were barterers, the my chicken for your corn kind of deal. Then, since bartering wasn’t efficient, we needed a more standardised mean of exchange: a good that could pass as a store of value. Precious metals were the perfect candidates — they became coins, a form of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, later on, those coins evolved once again and became paper money — still a currency, but the origin of their value shifted: while a coin gets its value from its very material (the precious metal it’s made of), the paper money needs an institution to emit it and guarantee its value one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the digital era, money evolved one more time. It’s now all “digital” — just bits, 0 and 1 located somewhere in a server and transiting almost instantly in the fiber network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take our time to methodically deconstruct the tale in order to dismiss it, we’ll learn quite a few things along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;money-is-not-a-store-ofvalue&#34;&gt;Money is not a store of value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lets-burn-some-cash-to-understand-moneybetter&#34;&gt;Let’s burn some cash to understand money better
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s study together the example that made the distinction between the two very clear to me: let’s say I burn a $20 bill — will any value be destroyed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/joker.jpeg&#34;

&gt;
Thanks to the Joker for helping with the experiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… Simply no! What has been destroyed is my ability to claim the aforementioned value: I can’t exchange the ashes of my bill for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-itrain&#34;&gt;Make it rain!
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between a store of value and a claim upon value allows us to also understand &lt;strong&gt;the obsession with circulating currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, money is not wealth by itself: as long as the money is not claimed (spent for goods or services), it has no contribution whatsoever to the wealth of the given country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/fly.gif&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our previous cash burning experiment to dig deeper: when I burnt my $20 bill, it had no impact on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the USA. Yet, if I start to burn millions of dollars, we might start to see &lt;strong&gt;secondary consequences&lt;/strong&gt; affecting the GDP: since there will be less money circulating, there might be less people using it to claim value (a beer, clothes…) and therefore an impact on the real economy of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those secondary consequences will &lt;strong&gt;only happen if the cash I burnt was meant to be spent&lt;/strong&gt; — if burning the bills prevented me from claiming the value they carried. Hence, if I’m a multi billionaire (so let’s assume: incapable of spending all of my money), I can burn millions of dollar without having any impact on the economy: those millions would have never flowed back into the economy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting a stop to the flow of money which would have changed hands without that stop is like preventing others to work to provide value; this value would have been exchanged for currency if the money was circulating freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;counterfeit-money-realvalue&#34;&gt;Counterfeit money, real value?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get over with the myth of money as a store of value, let’s consider a third and last scenario. Let’s say I print a very **well done stash of counterfeit money **— everybody take it for the real one. Now I give out those bills to normal American citizens, and for the sake of the simplicity of this example, the FED doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/print.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, the happy citizens who got free real-like yet counterfeit bills will start spending them for goods and services — they will claim what is rightfully theirs because of their ownership of the bills, hence increasing the GDP of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all of this is a scam, no value was actually created: I only printed and handed out fake bills that people think legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money barely is the key to the gold chest. When money itself, its physical medium, still had value (such as gold or silver coins), the content of the chest was still tied to the amount written on the key. Now, we are in a system where keys are changing endlessly changing hands without ever returning to open the chest. &lt;strong&gt;Our trust in our currencies is so high that the amount written on the key is sufficient and even authoritative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bartering-and-its-inefficiency&#34;&gt;The myth of bartering and its inefficiency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the first tale about the origin of money presented in the beginning of this article: was bartering really as prevalent as the story make it seems?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place some context to answer this question. We’re talking about a world where money doesn’t exist yet; hell, the very notion of “property” is even clear yet. &lt;strong&gt;Of course there were exchanges, but the “exchange protocol” was very different that what we picture behind the idea of bartering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/swap.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premodern agricultural societies were largely self-sufficient: exchanges between the member of a given community followed informal systems based on relationships: the “economy” was powered by gifting and reciprocity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, rather than the &lt;code&gt;my goat for your corn&lt;/code&gt; kind of deal, it was more like &lt;code&gt;I will help you build this house because I know how to do it. Later on, you&#39;ll help me furnish this other house since you&#39;re a skilled woodworker. If you don&#39;t, it can put an end to 1/our relationship, 2/your very place in the community&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Considering the system depicted above was informal, the “if you don’t…” part didn’t need to be stated, it was understood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the premodern agricultural societies depicted above, barter also existed but wasn’t the main mean of exchange: it was useful to be able to exchange with people who didn’t share the kind of relationship we depicted — for exchanges between communities for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-distortion-of-the-historians-lens&#34;&gt;The distortion of the Historian’s lens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be another reason to explain why the tale of the evolution from bartering to currency is still prevalent. &lt;strong&gt;To reconstruct the past, historians use remains found in modern times&lt;/strong&gt;. Coins stand the test of time. On the opposite, informal gift/counter-gift dynamics barely leave any traces behind them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Helixism was born when Reddit started to play Pokemon, together (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;The Origin of Ancient Helixism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the example frequently chosen to illustrate the bartering system are doubtful. We’re talking about &lt;code&gt;goat vs corn&lt;/code&gt; deals, but is it realistic in the context of a premodern agricultural society? Since they were mostly auto sufficient, bartering was for goods that weren&amp;rsquo;t required for the community&amp;rsquo;s survival, since these were already produced within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;downplaying-the-role-ofbanks&#34;&gt;DOWNPLAYING THE ROLE OF BANKS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tale of the origins of money, banks look like mere intermediary. They provide more or less practical systems allowing the money to flow: it used to be ledgers, and it’s still is but now we have a clunky web interface to write/edit stuff in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this skip &lt;strong&gt;the crucial role played by banks in our current monetary systems: monetary creation&lt;/strong&gt;. For the sake of the easy-of-comprehension of this article, I won’t dive into the depths of it in here, a quick presentation of it will have to suffice. This mechanism is called the fractional-reserve banking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;fractional-reserve&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short and (too) quick explanation — a central bank emit a monetary base allowing commercial banks to issue currency by themselves through loans. When Bob comes to Bank of America for a $10,000 loan, BA is not pulling money from its reserve to credit Bob’s account. No, what happens instead is this: the amount written in Bank of America’s ledger next to Bob’s name is increased by 10,000, and that’s pretty much it. The confidence is the banking system is preserved through mandatory reserve, corresponding to a fraction (~10%) of the loaned amount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Which leads us to our next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bits-a-digital-ledger-is-still-a-good-oldledger&#34;&gt;The myth of bits: a digital ledger is still a good old ledger
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we are clear on monetary creation — made by bank and nothing more that an input on a ledger — let’s tackle the last myth surrounding money, the one that states that money became 0 and 1, bits stored somewhere on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/1000xcut.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In real life, the nature of money hasn’t changed&lt;/strong&gt;: the good old bank ledger is still authoritative. Its authority comes from the fact that it doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it draws its authority from the whole &lt;strong&gt;political, societal and judiciary system that surround it&lt;/strong&gt;. The way we interact with the ledger (analog or digital) doesn’t reshuffle the decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With credit cards, ATMs, online banking and all the others “innovations”, it might seem like our monetary system evolved. In reality, we’re still very close to our first monetary systems and our modern currencies follow pretty much the same rules as the old ones. &lt;strong&gt;Innovations and changes happened mostly at the interface level: how we interact with the ledger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/coins.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes happened at the monetary creation level, it used to be much simpler and a state matter but the rest didn’t budge much. Our modern currencies share more with the Gold Franc&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - pardon my Frenchness - that we imagine. Disruption has yet to happen on currencies, what we had so far is barely a parade of facelifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-sneak-peak-into-the-real-monetary-innovations&#34;&gt;A sneak peak into the real monetary innovations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed to lay out the groundwork in order to finally reach this point, the most interesting part: how does real monetary innovation looks like? The answer is not as simple as “Bitcoin”, it can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-the-ledgers-governance-mechanism&#34;&gt;Change the ledgers’ governance mechanism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: the current trust placed in our ledgers is due to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reputation of the institutions who handle the monetary systems, be it central banks, private banks or other institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The political, legal and societal framework built around banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general public ignorance of the mechanisms governing currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s not much to hold the whole monetary system afloat; don’t worry, you’re not the only one. Critics have been numerous and early; in the 80s the cypherpunk movement were already looking into alternative currencies to break free from the fiat ones.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiat currencies are intrinsically useless objects that serves a medium of exchanges. They only have value because a government maintain and guarantee it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cypherpunk experimented with digital currencies and eventually lead us to the Bitcoin introduced by Satoshi. With Bitcoin, &lt;strong&gt;the trust in the monetary institutions is no longer required&lt;/strong&gt; (“trustless”). Indeed, in short the idea is as follows: instead of trusting the banks and other institutions to maintain the ledger, why not make that ledger public (=blockchain) and rely on our peers instead? This system also requires the use of cryptography and mechanisms to reach a consensus on the public ledger (so there is only one), but that will be covered in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alter-the-innate-propriety-ofmoney&#34;&gt;Alter the innate propriety of money
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about a currency that depreciates if not used? It would help to keep it circulating. The idea is not new, it was theorised in 1916 already by Silvio Gesell and is called demurrage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a currency depreciating over time might seem scary at first as it contradict our intuitive comprehension of money (“&lt;em&gt;how can it be a store of value if its value shrink over time?”&lt;/em&gt;). We already have already established that this intuitive comprehension of money was far from the truth of the practical world. This kind of money has an evident interest for recessionary phases, as it promotes spending the money quickly and “punishes” hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;limit-what-kind-of-items-money-can-claim-be-claimedupon&#34;&gt;Limit what kind of items money can claim be claimed upon
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without even altering the innate proprieties of money, we can change what it can be exchanged for. Local currencies are a good example of this. If they are designed carefully, this kind of currencies can help revitalize the local economy and independent businesses. Local currencies are plentiful; the Brixton Pound (B£) is one of the most well known. The team behinds it does a pretty good job to explain their thought process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will provide you with a better understanding of money but most importantly that it sparked an interest and it makes you want to learn more about it! The actual monetary innovation has yet to happen. The good news is &lt;strong&gt;now that we have cryptocurrencies, it’s much easier to create new ones&lt;/strong&gt; — pretty much anybody can do it and it’s an excellent news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that all the mechanisms we talked about and many more will be implemented and tested at scale. They already are: there are more than 1500 traded cryptocurrencies and easily another 10 thousands local, confidential or developed for learning purposes. You would like to mint your own coins too?

&lt;p&gt;Beyond what blockchain can offer, maybe here lies the most valuable contribution of Satoshi. &lt;strong&gt;By creating Bitcoin, he paved the way and reminded the whole world that minting money isn’t reserved to states&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s the business of regular people too: you, me, us, and even your computer illiterate grandma should have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all changes, it sounds scary but if you think twice about it, it makes so much sense: &lt;strong&gt;who better than the future users themselves could design the currency the most fitted to their needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A 12 min overview for the layman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public is hearing more and more about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and cryptocurrencies, the philosophical and political underlying of decentralization are still kept mostly within the community. &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is bringing a paradigm shift that deserves more coverage than price action in my book&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I realized that I didn’t really understood decentralization. I got the high-level concept, but I failed to connect all the dots and &lt;strong&gt;understand the social and political ramifications of it.&lt;/strong&gt; Since then, I’ve done my homework and now it’s time to give back my humble understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Simpsons: Season 16, Episode 19 — Thank God it’s Doomsday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is not an easy change to apprehend. Imagine yourself in the internet early days, let’s say 1995. Could you have thought about all the potential use cases for this new tech and how they were going to unfold? Back then, you even had prominent actors from the tech industry &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;predicting the uselessness or failure of the internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Metcalfe, in InfoWorld, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waring Partridge, in Wired, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to laugh at them now, but ask yourself this question: Aren’t you doing exactly the same thing with decentralized services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first audience for this article are people who read two articles from mainstream medias before concluding that decentralization is stupid. &lt;strong&gt;Let me be the third and the charm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medias are here to promote emotional content that makes you react, so you get your dopamine shot and come back. They are not here to help you learn and grow. They caused their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one am simply a 26 years old French dude with a knack for writing and time on his hand. &lt;strong&gt;I have nothing to sell to you, but simply one goal: help people to realize what’s happening, so they can be part of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested the draft on people aged anything from 20y old to 60+. &lt;strong&gt;It’s foolproof, as long as your willing to lend me 12 minutes of your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll gain a framework allowing you to see decentralization for what it is: the premise of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is hard, scary and confusing. It destroys your previous references and leaves you in a world where you have to re-think everything again. It’s a lot of work to adapt, but the earlier your start, the easiest it is, just like it happened for Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share this piece with your decentralization-sceptic and decentralization-enthusiast friends alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-is-multidimensional-spectrum&#34;&gt;Decentralization is multidimensional spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious to some, but it’s an important fact: &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is a spectrum, not a state&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes from the most centralized systems possible, such as our current fiat monetary systems (&lt;strong&gt;“Central”&lt;/strong&gt; Banks decide pretty much everything) to the most decentralized systems, such as the English language (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here is an interesting infographic giving you an overview of the centralization of major industries:&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Lillian Wei, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-governance-how-decentralized-do-we-need-to-be-799a7988ce84&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you get the spectrum of decentralization, the second thing to understand is the &lt;strong&gt;different dimensions of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is than in absolute, they aren’t any typology of the different dimensions of decentralization. To make things easier, I’m gonna use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgStgMyR9sY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the one proposed by Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder of Ethereum, one of the leading decentralization projects) that features three main dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-architectural-dimension&#34;&gt;1. The Architectural Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This dimension is easy to grasp because about the physical things&lt;/strong&gt;: the devices, the servers, the stuff! The architectural dimension address &lt;strong&gt;the base units of the network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize architectural decentralization, you’ll need to multiply the devices powering your &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, and spread them around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Visualizer: Tangle.glumb.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know how architecturally decentralized a system is, you can ask these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many underlying devices are powering the network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they geographically spread or concentrated in one area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-political-dimension&#34;&gt;2. The Political Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics is about power. This dimension address the &lt;strong&gt;decision making process of the system&lt;/strong&gt;. The most politically centralized protocol is one where a sole decision maker makes all the shots. At the other end of the spectrum, you’ll have many actors and evenly distributed responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/decentralisation-layman/politics.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most politically decentralized systems, the spread between the least influential node and the most influential node is kept to a minimum. The perfectly politically decentralized network would offer the same influence to any node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good questions to determine how politically decentralized a system is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people/groups are involved in the decision making process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the power repartition looks like? What kind of criteria is used to weight each participant influence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they any recourse / appeal mechanisms built in the system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-logical-dimension&#34;&gt;3. The Logical Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logical dimension is by far the hardest of the three to understand. Don’t give up if you don’t get it from the first read! In Vitalik’s terms, it reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your system look like one thing single thing like a singleton or does it look more like an amorphous swarm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this dimension is about the differences between each nodes that compose the network. To maximize logical decentralization, you want them to diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let some fancy words scare you, it’s actually not so hard. Looking at examples really helped me understand this one, so here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A direct democracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture of a direct democracy is quite centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: there are a few places (parliament, chambers, police, military…) that are the nodes of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the architectural centralization, the decision power is spread in a direct democracy so &lt;strong&gt;the protocol is politically decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt; — aka it’s one main “body”. There is only one government enforcing one set of laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nation vs Federation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are architecturally centralized,&lt;/strong&gt; for the same reason than the direct democracy: there are only a few locations/institutions where the action happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are also politically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: the president/assembly/other elected or not officials hold most of the power, without any public oversight. You can’t swap president two years in, you have to wait the full term, even if the president lie, collude with foreign powers, mishandle public money… Hi to the elephant in the room! The federation might be a little less politically centralized than the nation, but it’s quite similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logical dimension is where things get interesting. While &lt;strong&gt;a nation is one unique main “body”, aka logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;, a federation is made of distinct “parts” that acknowledge and preserve their difference while working towards a common goal. Hence the federation is a good example of logically decentralized system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Source: Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The English Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture is very decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the English language as a protocol, a node would be any English speaking person. The good news is they are plenty, they are diverse, and spread all around the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The political dimension of it is also quite decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no single governing body deciding what English is and is not. Yes, there are official institutions publishing English Grammars for instance, but the grammar is not law: you can choose to follow it or not. The actual English, the one linguists study, is not the one depicted in a grammar, it’s the one spoken by all English speaking individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;it’s also very logically decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;. Two English speakers coming from different countries might speak an English that is very different from one another, because of the vocabulary, the emphasis, or even the sentence structure. You have many different kind of English spoken all around the globe: American English, UK English, my beloved Frenglish…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-three-dimensional-decentralization-spectrum&#34;&gt;Using the three dimensional decentralization spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each dimension is mostly independent from one another. &lt;strong&gt;You can have a service at one end of the spectrum for one dimension, and the other end on another&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-study-web-hostingservices&#34;&gt;Case Study: Web Hosting Services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) are the perfect example of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From an architectural perspective, they want their network to be as decentralized as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. As a hosting provider, AWS need to be reliable. To do so, they have many servers so that the redundancy builds resilience. Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;both for performance and security reasons, they have their servers spread all around the world&lt;/strong&gt;. It reduces latency and further increase resilience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, from a political perspective, Amazon has absolute control over the network. They can refuse to serve you, delete your content (if it’s illegal for instance) and the AWS user community no say on their decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Hence, on the political dimension, AWS is close the most centralized end of the spectrum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, on the logical dimension AWS is centralized, it’s a pretty monolithic company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-significant-hassle-than-can-be-worth-thetrouble&#34;&gt;A significant hassle than can be worth the trouble
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re clear on the decentralization spectrum, you might wonder why going through the hassle? Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;decentralized systems tend to be more complex and harder to manage that centralized ones&lt;/strong&gt;: they have many different components, a decision power spread between several parties and an accountability imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-decentralized-systems-efficient-for-computations&#34;&gt;Are decentralized systems efficient for computations?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those requirements weight on the system and slow it down, right? So why go through the hassle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it’s even more than that! It can be hard to find a relevant comparison between centralized and decentralized systems, but the price of computing power is probably the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, the ratio between the cost of the computing power on the Ethereum Word Computer vs a traditional one (ex Amazon EC2) is between roughly one million&lt;/strong&gt;. Scary ratio, right? (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xHiI-G_CQ&amp;amp;t=251s&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Don’t trust me, go here to check&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… yes and no. First, you have to consider how cheap computing power got over the last couple decades. We’re reaching a point where even just $1 spent on AWS represents a tremendous amount of computing power. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; presents the evolution of computing over the last 25 years with neat infographics:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well, we’ve got to ask ourselves: does the comparison even makes sense? It can be useful to understand the current state of our tech, but does it tell us anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization&lt;/strong&gt;. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, decentralized systems offer a set of unique advantages opening a wide range of use cases. Let’s go through the main advantages one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some cases, making a system decentralized is simply the best way to answer your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the physical distribution of post offices is decentralized. It wouldn’t be efficient to have all the post offices in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion that can play a large role for the efficiency of a system: &lt;strong&gt;spare capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider people who already own a resource (let’s say a house or car), but only use it 10% of the time. Instead of having to build a whole new infrastructure for your service, you can use instead the spare capacity that is already available: hello Uber or Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fault-tolerance&#34;&gt;FAULT TOLERANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a decentralized system is redundant (there are no elements that exist only once, all have many “copies”), &lt;strong&gt;the risk of the whole system failing accidentally is much more limited than a centralized system.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s precisely why web hosting services have to be architecturally decentralized. But many systems benefit from fault tolerance: consider the energy production/distribution network for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion quite useful to understand why decentralized system are resilient, it’s the &lt;strong&gt;SPOF. Single Point of Failure&lt;/strong&gt; is a term used in network infrastructure to describe an element than is not redundant: it exists only once. &lt;strong&gt;If this element was to fail, it would bring the whole system down, hence the name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still following, you should be able to connect the dots: since everything is redundant in a an architecturally decentralized system, there are no SPOF. If there is a SPOF, it means that there is a single/central element somewhere (that could break), hence it’s not a decentralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;attack-resistance&#34;&gt;ATTACK RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attack resistance is essentially a matter of cost/benefit. &lt;strong&gt;Unattackable systems don’t exist, what do exist are systems that are simply to costly to attack considering the potential reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider malicious actors that would be looking to damage the protocol not for direct financial benefit, but for something else. Maybe it’s a competitor trying to bring you down? Even in that scenario, the attacker would need to dedicate a lot of resource to have a chance to bring a decentralized system down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact to consider is also that information is spread over many devices. &lt;strong&gt;If an attacker manage to get control over one device, he only gets access to a fragment of the whole dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; It makes the system more resilient to hacks, as the data is less exposed. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.fr/search?q=ashley&amp;#43;madison&amp;#43;hack&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR792FR792&amp;amp;oq=ASHLEY&amp;#43;MADISON&amp;#43;HACK&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3446j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Too bad Ashley Madison wasn’t architecturally decentralized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;collusion-resistance&#34;&gt;COLLUSION RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind collusion resistance is to make it hard for one subgroup of the system to come together and act only for their own best interest, to the detriment of the whole system. The extreme example of collusion would be a monopoly — it lets actor gain an unfair advantage over the whole market and impose its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instance, in our modern democracies, collusion resistance is extremely low&lt;/strong&gt;: the common interest of the system (the betterment of the country) is frequently, some would even say systematically hijacked by specific subgroups (such as businesses) for their own benefits (profits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is a high level concept that is essential to understand blockchain and other decentralized ledgers. If you want to explore further, you can look at videos of founders of the major project explaining their vision to get a better idea of what a decentralized system enable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have missed the internet revolution, but you’re in luck for this one: it’s barely beginning! &lt;strong&gt;Now is the time to get knowledgeable about it so you can recognize and harness opportunities as they emerge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better understanding of the paradigm shift offered by the newfound ability to develop decentralized protocols at scale, thanks to blockchain. and other decentralized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
