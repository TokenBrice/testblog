    <p>Whether you believe or not in the idea of ‚Äúthe march of history‚Äù, there is an undeniable worldwide trend that is leading to a complete overall of the power structure: <strong>the progressive disengagement of the state from state affairs</strong>.</p>
<p>While this idea is slowly creeping into the public head space, what‚Äôs less discussed is what‚Äôs next? What happens once the decomposition is over and there is nothing left? That‚Äôs precisely what I‚Äôll address today. I will also suggest a framework to consider the role of the state/nation in a post nation-state world: <strong>the Nation as a Service (NaaS)</strong>. Before we dive in, let us agree on what ‚Äúdecomposition of the nation state‚Äù means.</p>
<h3 id="a-long-and-methodical-process">A LONG AND METHODICAL PROCESS
</h3><p>It‚Äôs hard to determine when the methodical deconstruction of the state started. Like all societal trends, there is no set starting date and each country/region follows it at its own pace. Only one thing is certain: no state can escape it.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at the chronology of the decomposition of a nation state so we might be able to pinpoint the start of the process more precisely.</p>
<p><em>Note: What follows is merely a tale written to make you question the (shrinking) role of states.</em> <strong><em>It might hurt your political sensibility.</em></strong> <em>Feel free to jump straight to the second part of the article‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIntroducing the Nation as a Service.</em></p>
<h3 id="how-to-break-down-a-nation-state-a-step-by-steptutorial">How to break down a nation-state? A step by step¬†tutorial
</h3><p><strong>Let‚Äôs go to a fantasy world that will get truer than reality as we depict it</strong>. After a long a happy reign as king of BBLand (catchy name eh?), I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm done with it. It‚Äôs too much of a hassle, I‚Äôve made enough money. How can I let it go? I can‚Äôt just shut off the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù, I still have millions of citizens on my land. I‚Äôll have to go slow. But I‚Äôm in luck, I‚Äôve seen the process happening all around me, I just have to replicate:</p>
<h4 id="first-i-must-destroy-or-sabotage-the-flows-of-information">First, I must destroy or sabotage the flows of information
</h4><p>If it does flow, people will know what‚Äôs happening and might revolt, I can‚Äôt chance it. I‚Äôve got many ways to do this, but I think the most efficient is simply <strong>to allow an unprecedented level of concentration in the medias.</strong> Eventually, I‚Äôll have less than 10 individuals or companies owning them all, and those happy few will promote exactly the same worldview.</p>
<p>Now my citizens are left with partisan medias. Even better, those medias so concentrated they are easier to manipulate than ever before. <strong>Essentially, what I did is privatizing the attention of my citizens</strong>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm a very modern ruler you see. Just to make sure there are no reliable information anymore, I‚Äôll also make the advertising laws very lax, let lies and false information spread widely, and turn the political life into a TV show. Now we‚Äôre talking and by that I mean we‚Äôre not anymore, but that was precisely the point.</p>
<h4 id="then-i-must-get-rid-of-all-public-institutions">Then, I must get rid of all public institutions
</h4><p>Once again, I can‚Äôt do it overnight, I would risk an uprising. I‚Äôm gonna <strong>do it insidiously</strong>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with something remote and easy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe prisons. Prisoners have no rights anyway, right? Even if they do, nobody‚Äôs gonna check, they‚Äôre hidden from the rest of society! It‚Äôs the perfect population to get started: low risk, high reward. So let‚Äôs privatize, the market will deal with it!</p>
<p>Alright, now I need a hack for the schools, health care, transportation systems and other critical infrastructure. Let‚Äôs cut spending. And cut some more. And some more. By the way, have you seen how inefficient the schools and hospitals have become? Shouldn‚Äôt we privatize them to make them efficient again? Excuse me?! I‚Äôm hearing a no? Cut! Cut! Cut! Is that a yes? See? When you think twice about it you finally see the light, good citizen.</p>
<p><em>Note: Yes I‚Äôm a Frenchie and I am sincerely sorry for the citizens of the states that never knew what a public healthcare service was. You‚Äôre simply moving faster than us! Hurray, ‚Äúprogress‚Äù!</em></p>
<h4 id="now-i-leave-everything-to-themarkets">Now, I leave everything to the¬†markets
</h4><p>Now that I finally managed to get rid of public institutions, I want to finish the process, <em>optimize the efficiency</em> of my country even more. What can I do?</p>
<p>There must be some stuff we haven‚Äôt thought of selling yet? What about the forests? They can make money! And the beaches? People should pay for them! I‚Äôm seeing a free park? Are you out of your mind? Oh! We forgot to privatize the water distribution network? But all my citizens are users, that‚Äôs a potential goldmine! Let‚Äôs organize a tender.</p>
<p>Oh and what about our work laws? Citizens are still thinking they entitled to stuff like ‚Äúunemployment‚Äù. I even had a madman the other day who wanted to prosecute a big corporation for not being socially and ecologically responsible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat a lunatic! I‚Äôm gonna slash the work laws a dozen times, just to remind them <a class="link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tripalium"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >what ‚Äúwork‚Äù used to mean: torture</a>. I don‚Äôt even have to go this far, slavery will be enough. But don‚Äôt call it like this, no; remember: I‚Äôm a progressive ruler. I‚Äôm gonna leave them the freedom of choice: would you rather bike for UberEats or Deliveroo?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a rest and contemplate: I have markets everywhere, docile citizens with close to no job security and I‚Äôm finishing up on the demolition of the last public institutions. I‚Äôm getting there, but I feel like I‚Äôm missing something.</p>
<h4 id="finally-from-people-togoods">Finally, from people to¬†goods
</h4><p>You don‚Äôt have a job? Don‚Äôt you know that unemployed people are parasites? They bring down the whole society! What am I hearing? You can‚Äôt find a job? Oh my dear, you need to learn how to market yourself, develop your personal brand. How else do you expect to be visible in such a competitive job market?</p>
<p>Oh yes, that‚Äôs very regrettable. It makes me angry too. Sadly I can‚Äôt do anything about it: it‚Äôs the market. If I start to promote progressive laws the jobs will go away. Our neighbor CCLand is taxing companies even less than us; we‚Äôll bleed jobs!</p>
<h3 id="so-when-did-the-deconstruction-of-the-statestart">So when did the deconstruction of the state¬†start?
</h3><p>I‚Äôm sure our little trip to BBLand reminded you a thing or two about the real world. But in reality, all four processes are almost concomitant. Only the first one‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe decomposition of the medias‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääseems to be a prerequisite of the others.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs even more surprising is how this process started to unfold roughly at the same time in the most developed countries: in the mid 70s. That could be a good starting date. But, I‚Äôm not here to talk about media concentration, it‚Äôs merely an argument to support my thesis. <a class="link" href="https://www.osce.org/fom/13870?download=true"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"

<h3 id="introducing-the-nation-as-aservice">INTRODUCING THE NATION AS A¬†SERVICE
</h3><p>Going back to BBland for a minute, what‚Äôs left of our state? Barely the minimal business regulatory infrastructure: companies can‚Äôt police themselves. Is there anything alike already in the real world?</p>
<h3 id="welcome-to-e-estonia">Welcome to e-Estonia!
</h3><p>If you‚Äôve never heard about the Estonian e-residency before, <a class="link" href="https://e-resident.gov.ee/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >go have a look</a> you‚Äôll learn a lot. I know most of my dear readers won‚Äôt so here is a screenshot from the official website linked above:</p>

    >Estonian e-residency official¬†website</a></p>
<p>So it seems that there are two essential features offered by the e-residency:</p>
<ol>
<li>A government issued global digital ID available to anyone</li>
<li>It‚Äôs not a citizenship, but you‚Äôre still <strong>enough of a citizen to own and operate an Estonian-based business</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, <strong>close to 30 000</strong> ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù  and other entrepreneurs became e-Estonian residents. Yet the e-residency is just a first step. I wanted to learn more about this intriguing and unique e-country, so I went straight to the source: <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@kaspar.korjus?source=post_header_lockup"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Kaspar Korjus, managing director at E-Residency</a>. Do read any of his article, it gives you an incredible insight on what‚Äôs happening. What follows is simply three insightful quotes:</p>
<p>On Estionia‚Äôs vision for its e-residency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estonia‚Äôs e-Residency programme is also a fast growing startup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalbeit a government startup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää</p>
\[‚Ä¶\]
<p>, often with <strong>best practices that we‚Äôve taken straight from the private sector</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-could-offer-estcoins-to-e-residents-a3a5a5d3c894"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Estonia‚Äôs potential cryptocurrency, estcoin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Estonia‚Äôs perspective, estcoins </p>
\[Estionia‚Äôs cryptocurrency project\]
<p> were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation from more people around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About the <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/happy-3rd-birthday-to-our-global-e-resident-community-7143adc73994"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >return on investment for the e-residency</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deloitte published an independent analysis, which revealed that every euro invested in e-Residency by Estonian taxpayers is projected to return 100 euros to the Estonian economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="defining-the-nation-as-aservice">DEFINING THE NATION AS A¬†SERVICE
</h3><p>Estionia is the perfect transition. When I hit publish, I might be coining the term ‚ÄúNation as a Service‚Äù. But in reality, <strong>Estonia pioneered the concept, I simply gave it a name</strong>. Kaspar pretty much defined it when he envisioned <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/what-is-a-nation-children-born-today-will-grow-up-with-a-radically-different-answer-b31f14403c3c"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >the future world of his three years old son Ruufus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But perhaps governments don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòtax‚Äô Ruufus by then anyway. **Governments can instead earn their main source of income by selling their services globally in the form of monthly subscriptions‚Ää**‚Äî‚Äämuch like how Netflix currently delivers its service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since he wasn‚Äôt looking at it from my angle, allow me to put words on what I see behind this concept. Here are the four cornerstones of the Nation as a Service (NaaS):</p>
<ol>
<li>The concept of nation state, as we use to know it, becomes obsolete. Regular nations are decomposing or powerless.</li>
<li>In the void, ‚Äúdigital nations‚Äù emerge. They might be tied to real nations (like Estonia), entirely virtual, or even raise money (ICO?) to purchase a land.</li>
<li>These digital nations will offer the same services offered by our current nations, on a narrower scope: they will focus mostly on business regulations. Then, the most advanced ones might expand their scope: finance, currency, healthcare, education‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Finally, citizens won‚Äôt be tied to a nation by birth anymore. Citizens will compare the offers from different nations and choose their fit. They might have to pay for the service (Estionian e-residency is 100‚Ç¨ one time cost). Nations will compete with one another to attract citizens, and extreme concentration is possible (winner-take-all market). We‚Äôll observe the birth of **‚ÄúCitizenship portability‚Äù‚Ää**‚Äî‚Äächanging nationality will be easier than changing your internet service provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>It‚Äôs simply a proposal, let me know what your think about the concept of Nation as a Service, and feel free to redefine it. Is this a disparition of the state, or just a transition to a new type of state? Probably a little bit of both.</p>
<p>So where do we go from here? Since Estonia is the most startupy of all the startup-nations, the development of the NaaS is viewed there with a very positive outlook. And indeed why not? So far it seems to have brought wealth and innovation to Estonia. I am the only one to wonder:  is this wealth really created, or simply taken from other countries‚Äô taxes? We‚Äôll know soon enough: <strong>the rat race has already started</strong>‚Äî‚Ää<a class="link" href="http://ereforms.org/news/estonian_press_wrote_on_unbelievable_azerbaijan-246"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Azerbaijan just joined the party</a> with its m-residency.</p>
<h4 id="final-notes">Final notes
</h4><p>My faithful readers know my strong interest for cryptocurrencies and decentralization, I kept myself in check all along the article so allow me to drift of a little bit now. I see many synergies between the NaaS concept and the blockchain: identity verification, taxes, contracts‚Ä¶ Yet despite the synergies, a NaaS is a very centralized institution. I‚Äôm puzzled. Could one really help the other?</p>
<p>Before I give you your attention back (I privatized it a while ago, it‚Äôs mine now, remember?), help me to answer this question: Should I cut the crap and start an ICO to raise capital for the first fully private NaaS? I could be the rattiest rat!</p>
