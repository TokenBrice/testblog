        <description>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/pegged-assets-swap-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Pegged Asset Swap Wars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, it’s been a while! As you likely know, liquidity management is both my passion and profession. In this article, I aim to revisit the basics and offer a brief history through the lens of pegged asset swaps. As we detail the liquidity structure and venues that best support those pairs, we will gain a deeper understanding of key concepts that remain critical to navigating that space today. We also get the chance to cover Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, the two most interesting releases of the year for liquidity-building who definitely deserved more airtime around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-days-of-pegged-asset-swaps-2018-2019&#34;&gt;The Early Days of Pegged Asset Swaps (2018-2019)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, more than half a decade ago, &lt;strong&gt;all we had to swap on the mainnet were Uniswap, Bancor, and some clunky order-book-based DEXes like EtherDelta.&lt;/strong&gt; So, when it came to pegged asset swaps, the options were minimal, and we were using the Uniswap V2 USDC/USDT pool, which was akin to sheer insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom in on this historical trivia to understand &lt;strong&gt;the level of waste that was achieved&lt;/strong&gt; at that time. When it comes to liquidity pools, the key parameter is the relative evolution of the two assets&amp;rsquo; prices: if you have done any volatile LPing, you’re deeply familiar with that. If you LP say LINK/ETH, the max pain for you, in terms of impermanent loss, is, for instance, ETH shooting up while LINK is dumping: your LP position decreases in ETH (which goes up in price), and accrues LINK (which is falling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USDC/USDT is another story, though, as the two assets are deeply correlated, with a maximum price difference ever seen between them of around 10% during a specific event (the USDC SVB depeg); in regular times, the two have a price difference in the basis point range. However, UNIv2 distributes the liquidity across the entire price range, meaning it allocates an equal amount of liquidity anywhere from 1 USDC = 0.0000000001 USDT to 1 USDC = 10000000000000 USDT. To put it simply: 99.9% of the liquidity in a UNIv2_USDC/USDT will never be utilized. I think it’s clearer on the graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/liquidity-structure.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquidity-structures&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only valuable liquidity there (assuming 1 USDC ≃ 1 USDT) is located at the intersection of the two green lines, making up a very minimal share of the entire liquidity distribution curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, note the stableswap liquidity distribution, displayed in blue, on the same graph. For assets at similar prices, the area covered by the curve is much greater than with the Uniswap invariant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stableswap-revolution-for-pegged-assets-swaps-2020&#34;&gt;The StableSwap Revolution for Pegged Assets Swaps (2020)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once StableSwap was available, stablecoin liquidity quickly migrated there, as it was significantly more efficient (we’re talking &amp;gt;100x improvements in efficiency vs UNIv2). It was &lt;strong&gt;the first live instance ever seen of Concentrated Liquidity on mainnet, before UNIv3&lt;/strong&gt;. The two are difficult to compare, as UNIv3 is much more flexible, while Curve-StableSwap is more specialized; however, kudos must be given where due. Along with increased efficiency, Curve provided an incentive model - veCRV+CRV emissions, which has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-wars/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;covered several times on this blog already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives are critical for pegged asset pairs, as they have some specific characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to be overall &lt;strong&gt;low-volume&lt;/strong&gt; (compared to a volatile pairing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**The fees LP can charge are much lower **(up until recently, the convention was 0.3% to 1% per trade for volatile assets, and 0.05% for pegged assets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their volume comes in spikes&lt;/strong&gt; correlated to events associated with the coin (ex, USDC depeg was one of the highest volume days ever for USDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of the above, I thought until very recently that incentivization structures were even more critical for pegged asset pairs than for volatile assets. With the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap, I don’t think it’s the case anymore. However, before we delve into them, we must first address another significant historical milestone in pegged assets liquidity: the release of Uniswap V3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-arrival-of-uniswap-v3-concentrated-liquidity-2021&#34;&gt;The arrival of Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity (2021)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniswap V3 released and delivered customizable concentrated liquidity to essentially every asset type, enabling massive efficiency gains for all liquidity providers. However, since it wasn’t just for pegged assets, it almost meant amplified impermanent losses for volatile assets LPs. Considering the novelty of the liquidity structure, along with the lack of infrastructure in the early days, the launch of UNIv3 was initially slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the customizable concentration delivered tangible benefits, especially for a subcategory of pegged assets I branded “loosely pegged assets”: think of pairs like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wstETH/ETH (correlated, but wstETH is up-only against ETH),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LUSD/USDC (correlated, but LUSD can slightly over/under-peg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such cases, &lt;strong&gt;UNIv3 concentrated liquidity enabled LPs to replicate a distribution similar in efficiency to Curve’s Stableswap but adjusted to the tokens&amp;rsquo; price action particularities&lt;/strong&gt;, and it translated once again into massive efficiency gains. However, the final unlock (as of the current industry state) was only to come years later with the arrival of Fluid DEX and EulerSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debt-as-liquidity-2025&#34;&gt;Debt as liquidity (2025)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t delve too deeply into the models of Fluid and EulerSwap in this post for conciseness, as I want to focus more on what it means for liquidity building. Simply put, Fluid found a creative way to transform debt into liquidity with “Smart Debt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture an average user supplying ETH collateral and borrowing USDC. Does he specifically want USDC? Most likely, he doesn’t care as long as he’s borrowing a safe and stable USD-pegged coin. He’d likely take USDT as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is precisely what smart debt does. In a smart debt vault, our borrower borrows a mix of USDC and USDT, which constantly evolves: his debt now serves as liquidity for the USDC/USDT pair. What that means for the borrowers is &lt;strong&gt;reduced borrowing cost, as he now earns trading fees&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially enabling him to offset the borrowing interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/fluid-smart-debt.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;fluid-smart-debt&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s from the borrower’s perspective, but now let’s switch to a protocol mindset. What does this mean for Circle and Tether? Essentially, &lt;strong&gt;liquidity at virtually 0 costs, with no form of incentivization whatsoever.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing really new there for Circle who has been sponsored by the whole ecosystem for years – but for another stablecoin, say a GHO, BOLD, or FRAX, that is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on Fluid here, but the thought process is similar for EulerSwap, although the implementation is different. EulerSwap is still in testing mode and already printing serious volume on USDC/USDT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand this, you can reach my thesis, which simply states, “I don’t see a DeFi where Euler/Fluid/Similar do not eventually dominate pegged-assets swaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seeing it yet? Remember the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegged assets pairs are usually low volume ⇒ low fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, they require heavy incentivization to maintain on a classical DEX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluid and Euler can sustain this liquidity at close to no cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ If (it already started) there is a race to the bottom in terms of fees for pegged asset swaps, regular DEXes have exactly 0% chances of winning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;0xorb-a-potential-challenger-2026&#34;&gt;0xOrb, a potential challenger (~2026)?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, to give you an accurate picture of the whole pegged asset swap landscape, I must mention another project not live yet, but promising: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://orbswap.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;0xOrb&lt;/a&gt;. The promise is simple: &lt;strong&gt;stableswap, but with n assets, n being able to go up to 1000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance, for stablecoin, you could picture a mega-pool well supplied in USDC and USDT, that then proceed to onboard “alternative” stablecoins and offer them great liquidity against the majors. The approach has merits for the long-tail of pegged assets, but I don’t see such pools dominating the core volume (USDC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;USDT or cbBTC&amp;lt;&amp;gt;wBTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, such pools could be cross-chain, although I think the benefit here is absolutely marginal if not &lt;strong&gt;detrimental&lt;/strong&gt; (⇒ increases the risks and complexity of the infra for no benefits), &lt;strong&gt;since USDC and USDT are increasingly bridgable 1:1 fast between chains thanks to product like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-for-incumbent-pure-dex-players&#34;&gt;What does it mean for incumbent pure-DEX players?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the most significant caveat: we’re discussing pegged asset swaps here. Replicating the same playbook on volatile pairs is much more challenging, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.fluid.io/t/current-issues-with-eth-usdc-pool/1606&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;as seen in Fluid’s Smart Debt+Collateral ETH/USDC vault and the losses its LP incurred&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEXes that generate most of their volume and fees through volatile pairs, such as Aerodrome, are likely not to be impacted by these new entrants. &lt;strong&gt;The reality is, however, much grimmer for DEXes focusing on pegged assets&lt;/strong&gt;, and I want to consider two of these to wrap this article up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curve-game-over-unless-there-are-sizeable-changes&#34;&gt;Curve: game over unless there are sizeable changes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegged assets swaps remain critical for Curve, still seen as the home of stablecoin liquidity. Indeed, there were attempts to capture volatile volume with CryptoSwap, but it proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of Fluid and EulerSwap, I think Curve is the DEX with the most to lose, and I don’t see it maintaining a prominent volume (they have already been kicked out of the top 10 a while ago) unless sizable changes are happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;veCRV revamp&lt;/strong&gt;: harnessing the learnings from newer models like veAERO to optimize the CRV emissions allocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased DEX efficiency harnessing crvUSD&lt;/strong&gt;: for instance, by enabling crvUSD loans to Curve LPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new liquidity structure for volatile assets&lt;/strong&gt; : so that Curve can capture the associated volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ekubo-the-confident-latecomer-rushing-to-its-demise&#34;&gt;Ekubo: the confident latecomer rushing to its demise
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekubo’s situation is arguably even worse, as they came only recently to the party. At face value, Ekubo on Ethereum is a fast-growing DEX printing serious volumes. Ekubo is essentially a UNIv4-alt, with slightly more liquidity structure customization and a DAO that proved less extractive than Uniswap’s (the lowest bar of all, but still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in where the volume comes from: the vast majority (&amp;gt;95%) of it is on a USDC/USDT pair with 0.00005% fees and heavily incentivized. Ekubo is essentially playing a race to the bottom it cannot win because Ekubo cannot sustain extremely low fees in the long term (LPs must eat), while Fluid/Euler can (if borrowers receive even a 0.1% yield on their debt, thanks to smart debt, they are better off than without smart debt and thus happy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokenBrice/blog/refs/heads/master/static/img/2025/pegged-assets-swap/ekubo.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;ekubo-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a $2.6M TVL pool, processing ~$130M volume daily for $662 of fees collected daily, incentivized ~8% in EKUBO, they are already fast approaching the limit of what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amusing aspect of all this is that &lt;strong&gt;Ekubo itself initiated the race to the bottom with the USDC/USDT swap fees and will be spectacularly vainquished at its own game&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi never ceases to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I hope this article was insightful and deepened your understanding of the pegged assets swap game. I look forward to getting my character trashed by the Ekubo community simply for stating an opinion driven by facts: their reaction gave me extreme confidence in my assessment, as I have observed the same response when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced MAI&amp;rsquo;s absurd security practices, and it got hacked + depegged shortly after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I denounced R/David Garai&amp;rsquo;s gaslighting and lies, and R proceeded to get hacked into oblivion &amp;lt;6 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I criticized Prisma’s team behavior, and they proceeded to get hacked and shut down the protocol &amp;lt;12 months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on. Best of luck to all, especially the EKUBO bag holders – try to have some class in your dismay that would serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leverage Like a Sir: Polynomial Gains, No Liquidation Pains</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/leverage-sir/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/leverage-sir/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/leverage-sir-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Leverage Like a Sir: Polynomial Gains, No Liquidation Pains" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Sir Trading, a fascinating novel DeFi primitive was shipped, and I quickly fell in love with it. I’ve also decided to get involved, so welcome to this article introducing Sir Trading, explaining what I found interesting in the model, and announcing my involvement as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sirtrading-explained-like-a-business&#34;&gt;Sir.Trading explained like a business
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand Sir Trading (and it works well with most protocols), we can use a business metaphor: Who are the customers, intermediaries, and stakeholders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-diagram.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-diagram&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start from the bottom up: our “customers” are the APEs who open leverage positions and pay fees. Everything else is a &amp;ldquo;means&amp;rdquo; to that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second population is the “intermediaries”, the liquidity providers on the Sir Protocol, called TEA holders, also called “gentlemen”. They are necessary because the more TEA liquidity exists, the greater APE’s capacity to lever up, and thus, the more likely users are to ape at scale. Maximizing this population is essential, as it helps to address one of the main weaknesses of the Sir model: the &lt;strong&gt;absence of leverage decay can only be guaranteed if the liquidity provided is sufficient compared to the leveraged position opened.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it makes sense to incentivize liquidity providers with SIR emissions to attract liquidity proportional to APE demand. Additionally, continuous SIR rewards provide LPers with stable income, complementing the volatile minting/closing fees they also earn—a critical advantage, as LPers usually prioritize predictability (cf. Aerodrome vs. Uniswap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SIR holders act as stakeholders. They can stake their tokens to receive ETH dividends from fees collected on positions opening and closing and, in the future, could be involved in a mini-governance centered around decisions about resource allocation (⇒ which vaults to incentivize with SIR emissions?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our three core populations defined, we can essentially assemble them into the “business model” of Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-business-model.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-business-model&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIR Protocol aims to maximize its customer base (APE holders), which drives revenue shared with stakeholders (SIR holders). Stakeholders approve SIR emissions to fund intermediaries (TEA LPers) that provide the liquidity necessary to the purpose and allocate it to the vaults most relevant to drive usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zooming-in-on-the-apes-side&#34;&gt;Zooming in on the APE’s side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the protocol&amp;rsquo;s core is the APE—the ability to leverage any asset traded on UniswapV3. But what makes this leverage so interesting, especially compared to the myriad of other options now available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below should answer the most important questions for anyone already familiar with other protocols offering leverage, such as f(x) or Squeeth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Type of Returns
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;polynomial (=/ multiplicative)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Max leverage
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Up to ^5 with no leverage decay given sufficient liquidity, realistically ~ ^2
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Liquidation
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;None
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Rebalancing
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;None
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Fees
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;No funding fees, only set fees paid when opening or closing position
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Assets Supported
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Potentially any traded on UNIv3 + permissionless vault deployment
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Security Considerations
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Protocol to be eventually fully immutable once out of Beta Mode, oracle used is trustless (UNIv3)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, I think the offer is quite compelling even when compared to existing options, although it is a bit “weird” if you are used to other more classical leverage products as you have to wrap your head around a few new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;polynomial-returns&#34;&gt;Polynomial returns?!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let’s tackle &lt;strong&gt;the question of linear (most common) vs polynomial leverage (Sir’s case)&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are not a math buff, I think the first thing to understand about polynomials is that their impact is increasingly more palpable as the price moves farther from the starting price. It is better to be careful, as it works both ways. Let’s illustrate with a hypothetical simplified position started when ETH = $2000 (fees are ignored for simplicity; we’ll come back to them later):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$2500 (+25%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$3000 (+50%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4000 (+100%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;10000 (+400%)
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Linear - ETH x2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;3 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;18 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Polynomial - ETH ^2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;3 125
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 500
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;8 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;50 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Linear - ETH x5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 500
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;7 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;12 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;42 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Polynomial - ETH ^5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 103.52
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;15 187.5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;64 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;6 250 000
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see that last row/column scenario, with our ETH^5 ape reaching a &amp;gt;$6M Valhalla on a mere 1 ETH base position (with a +400% price appreciation)? That’s the power of polynomial returns. What we looked at above is enticing, although it abstracts many factors, including the fees, and assumes no leverage decay for both positions. Picture it as an example of understanding the power of polynomial vs linear in a financial context more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polynomial returns (convex payouts) have historically been overpromised and underdelivered. Delivering them consistently is usually challenging, but they are generally implemented with &lt;strong&gt;corrective factors&lt;/strong&gt; of different natures and names: time decay, volatility decay, leverage decay, etc. The usual model for such a product revolves around &lt;strong&gt;managing loans between traders and lenders&lt;/strong&gt; to keep the leverage as constant as possible. This leads to models where leveragers constantly stream varying fees to lenders and still see their positions often rebalanced. With Sir, this correcting factor is clear and explicit upfront – that is that steep fee, so let’s dive right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fee-structure&#34;&gt;Fee Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the fee model, which is also quite different from the usual. Sir fees are fixed, dependant on your leverage, and charged ½ at position opening (APE minting) and ½ at position closing (APE redemption). At first glance, they might seem quite steep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Leverage
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Total Fees
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;^1.5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;17.35% of principal
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;^5
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;69.13% of principal
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom in on an ETH/USDC^1.5 position to understand better the impact of the polynomial leverage and the Sir’s fees, with a hypothetical position opened at ETH = $2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-calculator.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-calculator&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ETH = $4000 (+100%), such position is up ~17% in ETH terms or ~134% in USD terms. Of course, by this point, you are a polynomial leverage expert, and thus you understand that &lt;strong&gt;the gap between the ETH/USDC^1.5 and raw ETH holding increases the further the price appreciates&lt;/strong&gt;. At ETH = $6000 (+200%), the position is now up ~43% vs ETH or ~330% vs USD. At ETH = $8000, we are now at ~65% gains vs ETH and ~562% vs USD. Again, this works the same way in reverse; please remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this explicits well the “goal of the game” with Sir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, you want to seize a nice dip + reversal to open your position on a favorable price and quickly earn enough returns to cover the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your goal is then to seize the maximal spread between your opening and closing price, knowing that each % you can grab provides exponentially more returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product&amp;rsquo;s design is well-suited for such plays since you do not have to worry about funding fees or time decay. You’re essentially looking to buy low and sell high; welcome to crypto: except this time, you have a tool amplifying your returns the more you manage to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its fee structure, &lt;strong&gt;Sir is geared toward leveragers with a long-term perspective&lt;/strong&gt;, which matches its other key features (no liquidation, no leverage decay). Overall, the fees paid are similar to those that would be incurred maintaining a margin position for a year, striking a balance between potential returns, protocol stability, and upfront costs. When opening a leveraged position, one of the main concerns is getting the timing wrong and chopped by range-bound price action, where the fees accumulate and take away any potential profits; this concern is non-existent in Sir’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to remind you one more time of the main limitation of Sir: the absence of liquidity decay can only be ensured if there is sufficient liquidity to stomach your trade. While it’s pretty &lt;strong&gt;reasonable to assume so for incentivized ^1.25, ^1.5, or even ^2 vaults&lt;/strong&gt;, it becomes much less certain for ^5 vaults, even with strong incentives, because of the maths I shared above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like more data to understand the impact of polynomial leverage in the context of Sir (=fees included), check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.sir.trading/leverage-calculator&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the new calculator on the Sir website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: APE tokens are ERC-20; thus, further composability could be envisioned. It could get interesting as the protocol grows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-the-tea-drinkers&#34;&gt;What about the TEA drinkers?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a decent understanding of the demand side, the APE/leveragers, let’s jump to the other side, the liquidity providers/TEA holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: TEA drinkers are essentially ~counter-trading APEs, as they provide the liquidity APE redeem against if they manage to earn and secure (redeem) sizable gains. When I say “counter-trading” here, I mean it similarly as a UNIv2_ETH/USDC LP is counter-trading the market: when the market is mostly buying ETH (⇒ price goes up), the liquidity providing positions are rebalancing to USDC, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even more simply, &lt;strong&gt;TEA holders are shorter against the underlying asset than if they were just holding it&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding this is all you need to be able to project the impact of price variants on your principal. You also have to &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind the liquidity utilization,&lt;/strong&gt; as if you are supplying to a vault where there is little/no aping, you are counter-trading little to no one, and your principal exposure becomes similar to a naked raw holding of the underlying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TEA holders are “shorter” compared to a naked raw holding of the underlying asset, they remain exposed to its price appreciation.  You can &lt;strong&gt;think of TEA holders as ETH/USD^0-1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the principal cleared out, let’s address the earnings as a TEA holder. It’s pretty straightforward: by default, &lt;strong&gt;TEA holders of a given vault collectively earn all the fees incurred by the APE minters&lt;/strong&gt;. Fees are earned in such (same token as the supplied token) and autocompounded. TEA holders can redeem them when burning their position to recover their principal + all the fees accrued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fees earned based on aping activity, &lt;strong&gt;some vaults are also incentivized with&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;streams of SIR emissions.&lt;/strong&gt; These currently include the most utilized: ETH/USDC1.5, wBTC/USDT1.5, SIR/ETH1.5, and SIR/ETH5. When vaults are incentivized with SIR emissions, ~10% of the fees incurred by the APE are redirected to SIR stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: TEA tokens are ERC-1155, limiting further composability, which is a good thing here, as you want to avoid restaking-type situations on those tokens, which are critical to the protocol&amp;rsquo;s proper functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;noteworthy-features&#34;&gt;Noteworthy features
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above, you should already have a decent understanding of the protocol, so rather than boring you with expansive explanations of each subtleties, I’ll instead zoom in on a few features of Sir I found worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trustlessness-maximization&#34;&gt;Trustlessness maximization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My blog readers will not be surprised to find a section addressing this, as maximal decentralization and trustlessness are my mantras. In that regard, Sir Trading fares quite well, and the design demonstrates the priority given to those two topics by its founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the most important – the potential immutability of the protocol. Considering its novel approach and the risks associated with it, making the protocol immediately fully immutable could be inconsequential. Instead, the approach developed here is a progressive path to eventual immutability with four modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/leverage-sir/sir-beta-mode.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sir-beta-mode&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir is currently in Training Wheels mode, in which some parameters, such as the fees can still be adjusted. From the Training Wheels mode, it can switch to Emergency in response to a bug or exploit and from here to a Shutdown (⇒ Redeploy) if needed. On the other hand, if all goes well, the training wheels can be removed, and the protocol can be switched to Unstoppable mode, where it becomes immutable. I find this approach balanced and interesting, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.sir.trading/protocol-overview/beta-period&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;definitely worthy of studying&lt;/a&gt; for other builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the oracle solution chosen, a critical element for any lending or leverage-based protocol. Here, &lt;strong&gt;the solution is simple and fully trustless: Uniswap v3.&lt;/strong&gt; It, of course, has limits, most notably the liquidity available on Uniswap to ensure the price is not easily manipulated. However, considering the top vaults are majors like ETH or wBTC, it’s not a big concern. It could be more of an issue for SIR-related vaults, but here again, the liquidity is reasonably sufficient compared to the token market cap (TVL in pools &amp;gt; 35% FDV). Further mitigation is implemented on the UNIv3 oracle (30 min TWAP) to resist price manipulation better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature in terms of trustlessness and resilience is the &lt;strong&gt;harnessing of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.sir.trading/protocol-overview/token-auctions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;token auctions&lt;/a&gt; to streamline fee distribution to stakers&lt;/strong&gt;. Sir is far from the only one doing this, as, for instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.euler.finance/developers/periphery/fee-flow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Euler Finance harnesses a similar logic&lt;/a&gt;. Such auctions enable the conversion of many assets into one (in this case, wETH) without adding unnecessary compromises to the protocol. I expect to see even more of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Xatarrer (founder) has self-submitted a DeFiScan review for Sir Trading, which is currently under review. Please check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defiscan.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiScan&lt;/a&gt; once the review is published for more details regarding Sir&amp;rsquo;s decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocol-owned-liquidity&#34;&gt;Protocol Owned Liquidity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is Sir&amp;rsquo;s lifeblood, and the protocol design acknowledges this with &lt;strong&gt;a keen focus on growing permanent liquidity (TEA) reserves&lt;/strong&gt;. Every liquidity provider deposit includes a fee (~8.99% of their principal) retained as permanent protocol-owned liquidity. Thus, incentivizing LPers with SIR isn’t just &amp;ldquo;renting&amp;rdquo; liquidity—it’s also an immediate partial &amp;ldquo;buyout&amp;rdquo; of their deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this, as the protocol grows and can attract more liquidity providers, it builds permanent liquidity reserves, enabling an ever-increasing “minimal guaranteed liquidity for APEs”. It’s essentially a virtuous loop progressively solving one of the main drawbacks of the model: elegant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-token-emission-model&#34;&gt;Continuous Token Emission Model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIR works under a &lt;strong&gt;constant emission model at the rate of 2015M SIR per year&lt;/strong&gt;, with the lion’s share always going to incentivize liquidity providers. There is, however, a switch in the distribution logic, made to give the protocol the means for its early growth in the first three years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first 3 years, 68.13 % directed to liquidity providers, 13.65 % to pre-mainnet contributors, 10 % reserved in a treasury, and 8.22 % to investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that: 100% to liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is efficient, as no vesting is needed for the team/investors/treasury, since the logic is wholly shifted here: you have to think in terms of streams of tokens (X SIR/day) instead of total balance and associated vesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-your-understanding-in-practice&#34;&gt;Putting your understanding in practice
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap things up, we can now articulate our shared understanding of the protocol by studying three different market hypotheses articulated into strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bullish-eth-or-btc-over-a-midlong-time-frame&#34;&gt;“I am bullish ETH or BTC over a mid/long time frame”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is the most straightforward; it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as minting the ETH/USDC^1.5 APE token. The absence of liquidation and funding fees will allow you to set this position and forget about it. &lt;strong&gt;Your primary metric to watch for here is the opening+closing fee at 17.35%: you need to seize a ~26% price appreciation on ETH to enter profit territory&lt;/strong&gt;, with your gains increasing in a polynomial fashion from thereon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish BTC: all the same, except using the wBTC/USDT^1.5 APE (main vault: good amount of liquidity available).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish ETH against BTC and looking for adrenaline: all the same, except using the wETH/wBTC^5 vault (careful, low liquidity right now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am bullish SIR against ETH: you have several tiers of leverage available to express that conviction onchain (SIR/ETH^1.5 and SIR/ETH^5 being the most liquid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bearing-eth-over-a-midlong-time-frame&#34;&gt;“I am bearing ETH over a mid/long time frame”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really?! No judgment; there is also a vault for that, in the name of USDC/wETH^1.5! Because this vault is USDC based, against ETH, opening an APE position there means going short ETH with polynomial leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inversely, supplying that vault as a liquidity provider (TEA) means counter-trading the (potential) shorters ⇒ being long ETH (if there is utilization), but from a USDC base this time. However, this vault is not incentivized with SIR emissions currently, so your earnings will stem only from APEs opening positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-bullish-sir-but-not-really-a-leverage-hungry-ape&#34;&gt;“I am bullish SIR, but not really a leverage-hungry APE”
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s understandable; not everyone is a thrill-maxxer. Here, you could consider &lt;strong&gt;harnessing the constant emissions to liquidity providers to build your SIR stash over time and only at capital opportunity cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Considering the LP supply fee, you are “forced” to sustain the position for a few weeks/months to reduce the fee&amp;rsquo;s impact. If you are worried about principal depreciation in the case of a significant market reversal upward, you could consider splitting your deposits over several incentivized vaults to hedge for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you initially farm with an ETH or wBTC deposit, you have a compounding option with your freshly farmed SIR: supplying the SIR vaults. Also, consider staking your SIR to maximize a mid/long-term SIR position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussing-my-involvement&#34;&gt;Discussing My Involvement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you, I’d like to give you more context on my involvement with Sir: I am advising the Sir team to help them with my core topics: growth, tokenomics optimization, and BD. I am compensated for this endeavour, and I am also an APE and TEA holder and, therefore, a SIR farmer – &lt;strong&gt;I am long SIR in all possible ways&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered Sir somewhat recently (the protocol is still just a few weeks old), but the timing was excellent. As those following me on Twitter probably already know, I have been profoundly disappointed with f(x), where I suffered from an abusive liquidation stemming from infrastructure shortcomings on their end (RPCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was, since then, on the hunt for an alternative solution to f(x) and stumbled upon Sir, which delivers some similar features (“real” no liquidation, no funding fees) but also brings welcome additions to the mix, such as the polynomial leverage vs linear: both the protocol and the timing were perfect, so going the extra mile to help it succeed happened very spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not approach advisory as a collectible to add to my wallet, show in 2 monthly calls, collect the payout, and call it a day. I am on the opposite side, equally maximally committed, involved, and selective with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Sir, considering the recency of the protocol, my current contributions revolve around raising awareness for the protocol, helping it get well integrated into the ecosystem, and expliciting its benefits to as many people as possible, as done with this article. I harness my extensive DeFi experience, network, and presence to support the team in all relevant ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-valhalla-or-hell-nothing-in-between-position&#34;&gt;My “Valhalla or hell, nothing in-between” position
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5f9038d9004b53501bdf05b3f30d8fc8fd2d8da6a89299a624276c7605bf4ea7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;I opened a ^5 SIR position on my public wallet tokenbrice.eth&lt;/a&gt; – feel free to track it: 500K SIR levered ^5 ⇒ redeemable for ~155K SIR at inception (~69% fees), opened on Mar-04-2025 08:34:47 PM UTC. If all goes well, I hope to eventually redeem this for ~8M SIR (⇒ SIR at 2x my starting price, assuming sufficient liquidity) and do something fun with it. &lt;strong&gt;I want to remind you that such leverage is the closest you can get to onchain insanity; this position is now known in the community as “Valhalla or hell, no in-between”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: As a protocol built for resilience, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/DeFiCollective_/status/1897575989032497390&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Sir is also supported by the DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;, which received a SIR donation, matched it with ETH, initiated and supplied the UNIv2 LP, and locked the LP token for one year to secure a liquidity baseline on the token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article and the above strategy are not investment advice but practical illustrations of what the protocol can do. You make your own decisions, and you are responsible for them. In case that wasn’t clear enough with the previous warnings: I am exposed to SIR as a token and protocol and stand to benefit from its growth; in other words, I am maximally aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeFi’s UX Disaster: Curation Could Save Innovation</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-ux-disaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-ux-disaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2025/defi-ux-disaster/defi-ux-disaster-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post DeFi’s UX Disaster: Curation Could Save Innovation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone worries about the infrastructure and app layers, and that’s cute, but what about the curation layer? Without it, the two others are nearly useless, as the complexity of the space is already far too great for most of the population to handle. So today, I want to plead to address the most significant lack in DeFi, informed by my experience with over six years spent educating people about it, onboarding pretty much anyone willing in my surroundings and online, and following up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-the-infrastructure-application-and-curation-layers&#34;&gt;Defining the infrastructure, application, and curation layers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move forward, we need to align on the key terms – those three layers. An image is worth a thousand words, so let’s study an interesting example taken from the wild that features bits of each of the three layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2025/defi-ux-disaster/jumper.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;jumper-exchange&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty dense flow involving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereum mainnet (infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wBTC (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayan bridge (infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave on Optimism (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USDC (application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumper (application + curation), powered by Li.FI (infrastructure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this “manually” would represent a hefty sequence of operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve wBTC on exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap wBTC to USDC on mainnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve USDC on bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge USDC from mainnet to optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve USDC on Aave/Optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit USDC on Aave/Optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurray! Here’s for the application layer working its magic! But I’d like to focus on another even more critical dimension here - the curation dimension of Jumper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumper auto-detected the tokens I had in my wallet as soon as I connected, allowing me to find my wBTC quickly. It found two potential bridges and “recommended” one by placing it first (because it has the best returns). It found the respective token contracts and protocol I needed. It also provided me with an interface to execute all this without worrying if I was about to send my tokens to a scammer — that might not seem much to you or me, but to a normie, that is close to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from that example, let’s take a minute to settle the definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure layer: the base layer&lt;/strong&gt;, which can include blockchains (Ethereum), but also pieces of infrastructure that are built upon at the next layer (Li.Fi&amp;gt;Jumper scenario).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo; Application layer: the end-user layer&lt;/strong&gt;, where they actually interact with DeFi – these include all the protocols, frontends, and toolings (DeBank, DeFiSaver, Jumper, etc.) you are aware of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;raquo; Curation layer: the “guidance” layer&lt;/strong&gt;, helping users navigate the options available at the application layer. While it exists independently, its insights can and should be integrated into the application layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective is essentially a simplified version of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Decentralized-Finance-DeFi-Stack_fig4_340061422&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Schär&amp;rsquo;s DeFi Stack&lt;/a&gt; where his Settlement and Asset layers are merged into my Infrastructure layer, his Protocol+Application layer into my Application layer, and his Aggregation layer is broadened and rebranded into my Curation Layer:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Schar-defi-stack&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Curation layer champions, others than widely used tools with a curation/directory element such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://coingecko.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CoinGecko&lt;/a&gt; (helping users to validate token contract &amp;amp; protocols front end URLs), &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jumper.exchange/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Debank&lt;/a&gt; currently are websites/frameworks providing essential and verifiable insights on key verticals such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://l2beat.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Curation can include various endeavours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation&lt;/strong&gt;: Helping users verify the validity of information, such as CoinGecko acting as a source of truth for contract addresses or DeFillama for protocol frontend URLs, or Rabby various warnings helping users to realize if they are interacting with a spoofed version of a given protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation&lt;/strong&gt;: Curation is provided on top of the aggregation (“here is the best route”). This includes all DEXes and bridge aggregators (ParaSwap, CowSwap, Bungee, Jumper, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifiable Insights&lt;/strong&gt;: Information service providers like L2Beat, DeFiScan, or Bluechip enable users to access contextualized and verifiable information (onchain and against their respective framework) in their given vertical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-curation-layer-defis-achilles-heel&#34;&gt;The Curation Layer: DeFi’s Achilles’ Heel
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unconvinced about the urgent need for a better curation layer, I beg you to onboard your mom to DeFi, explain the basics of a wallet, send her some ETH, and watch her scratch her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna swap? Sure, we have 200 DEXes, 20 aggregators, aggregators of aggregators, and also those new bridge aggregators that now handle swap, ah and let’s not forget the intent-based protocols; by the way, do you know you can also indirectly swap by supplying a UNIv3 pool? So which one is it gonna be? Oh, you heard of Uniswap? Right, let’s try this. No, Mom, don’t click that first link on the search results; it’s not the real Uniswap. “But it’s written Uniswap”&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curation-is-the-missing-piece-to-mass-onboarding&#34;&gt;Curation is the missing piece to mass onboarding
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the biggest helper when onboarding people? It’s not Aave, Eigen, or the latest shiny chains like Bera or Abstract. It was simple, straightforward, and easy to use tools such as DeBank or Jumper.&lt;/strong&gt; On top of the utility, both also act as a mini curation layer: DeBank helps users know their positions and provides them with a safe and verified link to the protocol frontends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumper essentially made bridging something a normie can handle. Before Jumper, they needed to know about the various bridges available for a given route, safely find their website and not a phising copy of it sitting at the top of the associated query thanks to Google Ads; and if their token was just a little bit “exotic”, they also needed to be familiar with the contract address find, copy and paste flow. All of this was abstracted in a simple and safe-to-use UI, making DeFi newcomers immensely more comfortable with the multichain world. I’ve witnessed it firsthand with my trainees; there was a before and an after Jumper in how much they could accomplish independently without worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both DeBank and Jumper have curating components, it’s not their primary focus. If we want to broaden the base that can harness DeFi, &lt;strong&gt;we need to double down on curation&lt;/strong&gt;, with dedicated apps and services well integrated with the main gateways users already harness (wallets, portfolio trackers, aggregators, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-we-get-there&#34;&gt;How did we get there?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the lazy readers, I’ll give it straight: &lt;strong&gt;the DeFi staples failed us&lt;/strong&gt; – that is, the top protocols, institutions, and other well-funded actors of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about those prominent protocols like Aave, Uniswap, or Maker and their associated DAOs: have you ever seen them fund something remotely close to a DeFi public good?&lt;/strong&gt; Think about the big layer 2 or layer 1 foundations; do you see them entertaining such endeavours? The closest we got was maybe with Uniswap and the DeFi Education Fund, but it has limitations; its scope is mainly lobbying for regulations, and there remain &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.uniswap.org/t/demand-for-transparency-from-defi-education-fund/13299&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;unaddressed concerns about its funding and transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception here would be that DeFiLlama was initially funded by ex-Curve team members. However, it was done at a personal level, not in the name of Curve Finance: still, &lt;strong&gt;it is worthy of praise, as it shows genuine concern for the overall good of the space&lt;/strong&gt;, and not just Curve’s success — an endeavour usually direly lacking in DeFi, and the main driver behind our current predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this better, let me tell you a story. When the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt; was still an idea, we contacted various teams that we thought were value-aligned to offer them to donate to the Collective. Our core idea and pitch were that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFi Collective will help genuine DeFi thrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are a top protocol, you benefit from having a strong ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, even if you do not directly benefit from the existence and success of the Collective, you will benefit indirectly over a longer timeframe, and you might consider donating nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few resonated with the project, and we can’t thank them enough (they are listed on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the homepage&lt;/a&gt;). But for most, the conversations went essentially like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Hello, TokenBrice here, /insert_pitch/”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “Nice idea! So our protocol, where would it stand on the framework?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me, being honest: “Well, it depends; it could be stage 1 or 2, but even if that is, we will most likely not allocate funds to it at least early on, as we have to demonstrate the positive impact the Collective can have with smaller projects first.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “So there’s nothing in it for us?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Not directly, but you will benefit from having the DeFi ecosystem thriving: that means more resilient protocols and tokens for your protocol to integrate.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Them: “Not interested.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it is just us, but it is not! Let’s look at the situation with the other curation-layer projects mentioned before. We have two oddities, DeFillama and L2beat, which, although they struggled initially, are now well-funded and often receive donations. Apart from that, it’s pretty much a nightmare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluechip initially explored a non-profit structure funded by donations but could not get sufficient funding, so it had to evolve into a for-profit venture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFiSafety is carried by only one chad, Rex, and had to introduce &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defisafety.com/pricing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;payments&lt;/a&gt;. Despite delivering high-quality and actionable reviews harnessed by many for years, it still barely stays afloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-curation-layer-projects-struggle-to-emerge&#34;&gt;New curation layer projects struggle to emerge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, the core issue is not so much about the funding of already successful and well-known curation layer projects but &lt;strong&gt;about smaller and newer projects not being able to source the funding they need to grow in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a project reaches an L2Beat / DeFillama size and awareness, supporting it can be seen as a “marketing cost” for adjacent projects. For instance, several L2s allocated a share of their token supply to L2Beat: it made economic sense for them, as it raised awareness of their L2. It achieved support for a public good simultaneously – a win-win! Thanks to their awareness and reach, these two curation layer projects also usually perform well on donation platforms such as Gitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cost-of-free-to-access-information&#34;&gt;The cost of free-to-access information
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is that these &lt;strong&gt;curation-layer services have serious costs&lt;/strong&gt;, costs they cannot recoup with their readers if they want to keep the information they produce maximally available – that is, free and open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give you insights on DeFiScan. Discounting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The months we spent researching and iterating on the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All DeFiCollective members who are seriously underpaid ($1500-2500/month for a half time) for their expertise and commitment (a.k.a. proper value-aligned Chads, I can’t thank them enough), are also supporting DeFiScan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many contributors, myself included, work closer to full-time for DeFiCollective/DeFiScan (for a half-time pay).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeFiCollective covers all infrastructure and service costs incurred by DeFiScan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; the effective cost of a review in the $3000 (small immutable protocol) to $10 000 range (large codebase, mutable protocol), and potentially even more (hello Aave and your infinite codebase). Mind that each review is not only written by the initial submitter (who can be one of us or someone tied to the reviewed protocol) but also carefully discussed and reviewed by other team members. With 14 reviews already published, that’s essentially &lt;strong&gt;a “burn” of $91k already in about five months&lt;/strong&gt; of existence. &lt;strong&gt;If we account for the review in progress (total including the live ones = 35), this cost jumps to $227,500, or a ~$45,500 monthly burn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that the above is an estimation, as no one is paying for DeFiScan – not you, the readers/users, or the projects reviewed. For some perspective, let’s look at Bluechip since Ben agreed to share their pricing – what projects pay to get reviewed: $15k for a holistic evaluation and a $5k annual maintenance fee, starting after a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not writing this to beg for your money – we are figuring it out on our own, thanks to the unique situation of the DeFiCollective, and exploring all other relevant options. This is a reminder that information (curation, in our case) has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-you-dear-reader-do-about-this&#34;&gt;What can you, dear reader, do about this?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I’d like to stress that the goal of this article, the message it carries, is not “donate to your curation layer services”. However, you are welcome to, and at our level, you already have. When we offered our community the opportunity to donate for the first anniversary of the DeFi Collective, you &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org/blog/first-anniversary-nft/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;jumped at the occasion&lt;/a&gt;. You contributed the maximum possible (10 ETH) in not even three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the message I would love to spread is more about &lt;strong&gt;1) the critical importance of the curation layer, 2) realizing the costs of the valuable information they provide, and 3) the need for you, me, and essentially everyone to be much more proactive in advocating for its funding.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty clear that big DAOs and other well-funded institutions are not too eager to fund this, so it is up to us to help them see the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thanks to the unique situation at the DeFi Collective, we’re not worried about our short/mid-term survival; however, I think it’s a necessity for the long-term survival of DeFi to see DeFiSafety, Bluechip, and other projects yet to emerge and thrive. We are, of course, all three chatting to one another already and contemplating a “DeFi Information Service Provider Alliance” (name is a work in progress), in which we would love to see more significant projects like DeFiLlama and L2Beat as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read my plea and heard my call, the next step is simple: &lt;strong&gt;go to the DAOs you are active on and ask them what they are doing to support the space beyond their immediate benefits.&lt;/strong&gt; The current situation, with its seriously undersized curation layer, has severe consequences that should be obvious to all: &lt;strong&gt;newcomers are getting butchered&lt;/strong&gt;, rugged, scammed, etc. As a result, our whole industry looks like a circus from the outside. &lt;strong&gt;DeFi can only go mainstream once the average new user is reasonably safe&lt;/strong&gt;; that is currently not the case. Moreover, curation tools are also a big ask from institutional clients actively seeking such resources: &lt;strong&gt;an enhanced curation layer means we will be better at attracting and retaining both individuals and institutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go nudge public and well-known whales and other well-funded institutions to do more. Protocols of the size of Aave, Maker, Uniswap, Eigen, and more have a responsibility to support the broader ecosystem. Since they are currently barely/not doing it, &lt;strong&gt;it’s our job to remind them and advocate in that direction&lt;/strong&gt;, as that’s the beauty of DeFi: if they fail to do it because they see no immediate benefits for them, I’m convinced that they will suffer long-term and face real costs because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/lending-protocol-renaissance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/0-lending-protocol-renaissance-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we’ve seen a flurry of novel and exciting lending protocols come to market, such as Morpho, DYAD, Fluid, or Tapioca; even more are expected in the coming months, such as Liquity V2 (Bold) or Euler V2. All are innovative, in the arena, trying things to the point that I wonder if we’re not experiencing a lending protocol renaissance after a few years of rehashing the same concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this article, I’d like to give you a tour of the interesting ideas I’ve seen being explored — we’ll go through some of the protocols mentioned above and, for each, focus on understanding their main innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collateralized-debt-position-cdp-protocols-vs-money-market&#34;&gt;Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocols vs Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, starting with a primer on the differences between CDP protocols (e.g., Maker or Liquity) and money markets (e.g., Aave or Morpho). It will come in handy as we will discuss both in this article and even finish with a project merging the two models into one protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDP (ex: Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Market (ex: Aave)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borrower Interest Rate&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Predictable, can even be fixed or initiation fee only&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volatile, entirely dependent on pool usage&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral accepted&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually limited options, cannot mix collateral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various collateral: a given position can mix several collaterals at once&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assets that can be borrowed&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the protocol stablecoin (DAI on Marker, LUSD on Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse – any asset enabled as a borrowable asset&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral re-hypothecation&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral are deposited in a pool and thus potentially re-lent to other users&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol core challenge&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stabilizing the stablecoin outputted &amp; securing enough liquidity on it&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attracting sufficient borrowable assets (USDC, ETH) to fulfill borrowing demand&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol main risk&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ stablecoin death spiral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ all borrowable assets are drained&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols stand out for their ability to facilitate cheaper borrowing costs, thereby stimulating more borrowing-side demand, a challenging feat to achieve. This is due to the unique feature of CDPs, where the user directly contracts debt against the protocol, eliminating the need to source and pay an external stablecoin depositor demanding a competitive interest rate, as is the case with a money market like Aave. The primary challenge with CDPs lies in the stability and liquidity of the stablecoin that is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money markets tend to be more flexible. Thanks to their structure, they allow users to mix and match collateral and can quickly onboard new ones. Yet, they tend to require more maintenance, as collateral parameters must be constantly adjusted to reflect the realities of the market. This creates quite the load for governance, as seen on Aave, where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://boardroom.io/aave/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;over a thousand proposals&lt;/a&gt; were already processed in four and a half years: approximately 22 per month. It works, but it seems overengineered; surely there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dyad-flirting-with-the-endogenous-collateral-taboo&#34;&gt;DYAD: Flirting with the endogenous collateral taboo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyad is a CDP protocol that implements several novel ideas, such as delivering free borrowing to its users, who must own an NFT to partake (Note). It also serves as the protocol&amp;rsquo;s base coordination layer. I invite you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyad.gitbook.io/dyad-docs-v2/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the documentation&lt;/a&gt; to become more familiar with it. Let’s zoom in on Dyad’s novel approach to handling a key topic for CDP protocols: overcollateralization.&lt;/p&gt;

To quickly tell, ask yourself this question: if the stablecoin fails, does the collateral also fail? If yes, your collateral is endogenous (ex: my beloved &amp;amp; defunct &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage-based stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;); if not, it’s exogenous (ex: ETH for Liquity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins harnessing endogenous or no collateral can scale quickly, as seen with ESD, Basis Cash, or Terra/UST. However, they can and usually do explode even faster. For this reason, harnessing endogenous collateral is considered a risky practice – worthy of an instant Red Flag / F on the stablecoin rating agency &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bluechip.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bluechip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/1-endogenous-collateral-bluechip.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to focus on today regarding Dyad is its utility token, KEROSENE, which is a mechanism for allocating the right to mint against existing surplus collateral in the system. By default, the system&amp;rsquo;s minimal collateralization ratio is 150%. However, KEROSENE holders can deposit it into their Notes to reduce their exogenous collateral ratio to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, KEROSENE is not technically an endogenous collateral but a mechanism to price and enable users to harness the protocol&amp;rsquo;s exogenous over-collateralization. KEROSENE’s utility gives it a “deterministic value” corresponding to its utility while deposited into a Note. Since KEROSENE is mostly farmed by supplying liquidity on DYAD, it could entertain an interesting flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/2-dyad-defillama.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;2-dyad-defillama&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the year, the protocol has seen gentle and steady growth, although still limited. The rollout is progressive: the base functionalities are live (Note, DYAD minting, LP incentives, KEROSENE utility), yet much more is coming: sDYAD, momentum (a mechanism to better align protocol participants), a lending market, etc. It’s worth following for any stablecoin enjoyer such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-v2--the-base-rate-of-defi&#34;&gt;Liquity v2 – The base rate of DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity’s LUSD remains one of the most successful genuinely decentralized stablecoins on the mainnet, so when v2 was announced, it gathered a lot of attention. After researching a novel approach harnessing a reserve model, the team pivoted back to a CDP protocol, growing from learning the first iteration. V2 is expected to be released by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to focus on one, in particular, on interest rate management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate management is crucial for all lending protocols, even CDP protocols. The rate can be easily defined based on the market utilization rate in money markets. For CDP protocols, replicating a similar approach is impossible, and other venues must be explored; several were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance-defined (ex: Maker / DAI): while this approach provides flexibility, it generates uncertainty for borrowers and challenges in governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithmic (ex: Liquity / LUSD): no governance is always better, when possible; however, it doesn’t come without shortcomings either. In the case of Liquity, the set initiation fee proved inflexible, which led to the protocol adjusting to a higher interest rate environment with redemptions and, thus, through a lowering of the overall LUSD supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v2, the protocol switches to an interest rate model (no more initiation fee), which should already provide more agility. What’s more interesting is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/liquity-v2-why-user-set-interest-rates&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how this interest rate is decided: directly by the users&lt;/a&gt;. The team introduces another protocol-level game with straightforward parameters: redemptions will be processed based on the interest rate paid by the user, from lowest to highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, users who choose a very low interest will put themselves first in line for redemptions, while those who pick the highest interest will be maximally protected. To make it easy for any user to partake, interest rate delegation will be possible, with various delegates delivering different mandates expected at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the protocol to rapidly adjust to all kinds of market environments, from low interest rates to high, avoiding the long redemption phases as seen in v1 while remaining immutable and delivering greater predictability to borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/3-bold-stability.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3-bold-stability&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the protocol gains adoption, the average interest rate observed could even inform beyond Liquity v2 itself, as it will correspond to a base rate borrowers are willing to pay on a risk-minimized and immutable protocol. Riskier protocols will have to offer a lower interest rate to attract borrowers. The v2 packs many more interesting innovations. To get up to speed, I recommend checking out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/bjnpck/status/1772227278606389496&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bojan’s thread of threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tapioca--cdp-x-money-market-convergence&#34;&gt;Tapioca – CDP x Money Market Convergence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapioca was launched just a few weeks ago and is still being progressively released, as some protocol components still need to be made live. In today’s highlight, I’d like to focus on two main items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of the CDP and Money Market model with Tapioca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The innovative token lock model harnessed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in. For more context about Tapioca, as often, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.tapioca.xyz/tapioca&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convergence-of-cdp-and-money-market&#34;&gt;Convergence of CDP and Money Market
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols face a challenge: they must deliver competitive yield on the stablecoin they output to drive demand. Liquity v2 will redirect most of the fees collected, thanks to the interest rate, to BOLD stakers, Maker has the DSR / sDAI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, another way to ensure stablecoin minters can access competitive yields is to build a money market on top of the stablecoin: that’s precisely what Tapioca is doing. Indeed, Tapioca is essentially a double protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the CDP—branded “Big Bang,” where users can mint USDO against selected collateral: gas tokens and LSDs. The collateral selection is purposely restrictive, as tokens accepted here directly affect USDO backing. Borrowers pay an interest rate and, depending on USDO’s peg situation, potentially an initiation fee of up to 1% (if underpeg). It enables users to loop-leverage their ETH / LSD exposure or simply harness their ETH / LSD as collateral to borrow some USDO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the money market — branded “Singularity,” which provides isolated markets where users can supply various types of collateral to borrow USDO, supplied by borrowers on the CDP side. This creates a native yield for USDO holders that is decorrelated from the CDP side, as well as offering an elegant approach to handle all types of collateral:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship resistant majors ⇒ CDP collateral =backing USDO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivatives / more risky tokens ⇒ Singularity = yield to USDO holders without compromising USDO’s backing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual structure allows Tapioca to host various collateral, with appropriate risk-mitigation measures for each. Since singularity harnesses isolated markets, the risk for each collateral onboarded there is isolated, and it can be further managed with its parametrization (LTV, interest rate, and liquidation bonus) and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twaml-an-innovative-token-locking-model&#34;&gt;twAML: an innovative token-locking model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After following and commenting on the DEX evolutions, starting with veCRV and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-vs-velo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the improvements we observed with Velodrome (veNFT)&lt;/a&gt;, I anticipated seeing token lock models harnessed on lending protocols too. It has been, but only in a primitive manner, with gauge-based emissions &amp;amp; governance token locking to allocate them, such as seen on Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca finally delivers with an exciting approach harnessing a new type of token locking (twAML), both for their governance token TAP and for the suppliers of the money market, to secure the supply side and thus drive more borrowing demand. Hence, after Velodrome improved the veCRV model and delivered the first credible improvement over veCRV, we might see its third iteration come to fruition. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td colspan=&#34;4&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Locking Model Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veNFT (ex: veVELO)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;twAML (ex: twTAP)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locked Position Transferable&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;TKN &amp;lt;&gt; veTKN ratio&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solely dependent on time duration, one veTKN per TKN if 4-year lock&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depends on twAML – the average lock duration of other lockers: if equal/above, then one veTKN per TKN&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veTKN &amp;lt;&gt; TKN Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, linear over time (ex, after 2 years of lock, only 0.5 veTKN per TKN)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Interest Accrued &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquidation Profit Shares&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Creation Fees&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Mint Fee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main innovation lies in the flexibility and additional game theory layer this model implements. Instead of a linear veTKN to TKN correspondence, depending on the time locked and maxing at four years, like with veCRV and veAERO, twAML looks at other lockers&amp;rsquo; average lock time (magnitude weighted). In practice, achieving a 1:1 TKN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;veTKN correspondence no longer requires a four-year lock but simply to lock for as much / longer than the existing locks. Thus, the lock time will rapidly increase during the first epoch, ramping up from the 4-week maximum initially set up until it finds an equilibrium point and potentially starts to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/4-twTAP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;4-twTAP&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released for the first time with dynamic adjusting, the twAML was met with excessive degeneracy and quickly ramped up over four years. Thus, the team has returned to work and switched the adjustment to epoch-based. The new iteration is expected in the coming weeks, another development worth monitoring for stablecoin and lock tokens enjoyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca is quite the beefy protocol, two years in the work. I’ve barely scratched the surface there, as there are many other components worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s natively omnichain harnessing Layer 0&amp;rsquo;s omnichain fungible token standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapioca, like Liquity, will be one of the few CDP protocols redirecting fees generated from stablecoin minting to its token holders through the twTAP model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewards for USDO lockers are distributed in oTAP, an option token connected to the twAML logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol is keen on accruing Protocol-Owned Liquidity, both for TAP and USDO, which will enable it to lower its liquidity maintenance costs and potentially turn it into a profitable endeavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cover more protocols, but this article is already beefy, so I’ll keep it there for today. There are many exciting developments for lending protocols worth discussing, such as the growth of isolated markets with protocols like Morpho or Silo. All of this and more leads me to believe that after years of Aave &amp;amp; Maker dominating the lending protocol landscape, we might see some challengers rising to a similar size, if not overtaking them in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be watching, and so should you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Gray for the cover image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Subtles nuances with great consequences: a cross analysis of Curve and Velodrome" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to address Velodrome/Aerodrome, a genuine success story in DeFi. I’ve covered DEXes extensively on this blog, especially Curve: this article will compare the two models and explain how Velodrome improved on the veCRV template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me start with a disclaimer: there are two core components to a DEX that everyone needs to be aware of to understand what follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The liquidity structures it provides (x*y=k, stableswap, CL, stableswap-NG, curve V2, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incentives model, which for a DEX is synonymous with its tokenomics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on the latter, the core of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s innovation. This post assumes basic familiarity with Curve’s veCRV tokenomics; if not, I urge you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/fr/crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read my previous writing about it&lt;/a&gt;, posted three years ago but still helpful to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vecrvvevelo-fees-collection--distribution&#34;&gt;A/ veCRV/veVELO Fees Collection &amp;amp; Distribution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fee collection and redistribution are the lifelines of a decentralized exchange. Here, simplicity is usually good, as the DEX segment leader Uniswap is still operating under an extremely simple yet brutally efficient model, where 100% of the collected money goes to the liquidity providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of its CRV token in August 2020, Curve explored an alternative path, where 50% of the fees collected on a given pair go to liquidity providers and the remaining 50% to the “DAO” (admin fees), meaning the veCRV holders. Curve introduced the concept of “liquidity gauges,” where locked token holders (veCRV) can direct emissions to be received by liquidity providers, creating an incentive baseline independent of the volume processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome launched two years later, at the end of May 2022, and explored yet another split, inspired by a previous project iterating on the Curve model: Solidly. Here, &lt;strong&gt;LPs get no exposure to the fees collected on the pairs they provide liquidity for and are fully incentivized by token emissions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core difference between veCRV and veVELO lies in how they handle the fees collected at the DEX/DAO level, where we observe differences in the amount of fees collected and their distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the nuances of this topic: they are key to understanding the pros and cons of each mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a1-amount-of-fees-distributed-velo--2-x-curve&#34;&gt;A.1/ Amount of fees distributed: VELO = 2 x Curve
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve and Velodrome operate under the same base logic: every week, a given amount of CRV/VELO tokens are emitted and distributed to liquidity providers. Each pool has an associated gauge for which veCRV/veVELO holders can vote, and the weekly budget allocation follows the proportion of the “gauge vote”: if a gauge receives 1% of the total veCRV/veVELO vote, 1% of all the emissions produced that week will be directed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emissions are essentially the main cost for the DEX: the price paid to attract and retain liquidity. What matters then is what comes on the other side of the balance sheet – the revenues: in our case, it’s the fees collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, revenues stem from the “admin fees” of each pool, which are usually set at 50%. This means the fees collected on a given pool are split 50/50 between the LP and the DAO/veCRV holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/curve-revenues.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-revenues&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward: liquidity providers get no exposure to the fees collected on the pool they supply; they are incentivized through $VELO emissions only, meaning that the DAO/veVELO holders get 100% of the fees generated on the DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this core difference already has a massive impact, the following one is even more meaningful as it pertains to how those fees are distributed to veCRV/veVELO holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a2-model-for-the-distribution-of-fees-a-fairer-and-more-efficient-approach&#34;&gt;A.2/ Model for the distribution of fees: a fairer and more efficient approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve harnesses a model that could be described as &lt;strong&gt;a fee mutualization system&lt;/strong&gt;: the fees veCRV holders receive depend only on the amount of veCRV they control. Without getting too technical, those fees are collected in the various tokens involved in the pool (such as USDC/USDT/DAI for the 3pool), and every week, harvested, swapped for 3pool LP token, and then made available for claiming to veCRV holders – as you can see, this means somewhat of an infrastructure to operate, the cost of which scale with the number of pools on the Curve DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Velodrome provides a superior model on all dimensions, as it achieves better DEX/LP/token holder alignment without any infrastructure required. Let’s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome connects gauge-voting activity with fee distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, the amount of veVELO one controls matters, but even more important is which pool one votes for since the &lt;strong&gt;voters are exposed to the fees collected on the pairs they vote for only.&lt;/strong&gt; They collect the fees as such (i.e., a voter of the ETH/USDC pool gets ETH and USDC), meaning the infrastructure required is much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome ties fee distribution to the gauge-voting activity: veVELO holders receive the fees collected on the pool they vote ONLY, paid as such every week. It enables the better alignment of veVELO holders with the best interest of Velodrome as a DEX compared to Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple twist creates an interesting voting flywheel. High-volume pairs collect lots of fees, meaning high incentives for voters. This leads to many votes, which direct sensible emissions to the pair, attracting more liquidity providers, enabling more volume processing, etc., until an equilibrium point is reached. This means that high-volume pairs sustain themselves without bribes or a benevolent profit-minimizer whale-voter needed, which is not the case with Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a3-what-it-means-in-practice&#34;&gt;A.3/ What it means in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough with the explainer; let’s illustrate by considering the case of a veCRV/veVELO voter, who decided to vote for a pair processing minimal volume (the situation is common).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veCRV holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Curve as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives the same amount of 3CRV as a more Curve-aligned voter with an equivalent veCRV bag trying to direct incentives to maximize volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Velodrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A significant veVELO holder votes for a pool processing a marginal amount of volume compared to its TVL, either to collect a bribe or because he wants to support the tokens involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His voting activity is detrimental to Velodrome as a DEX because he directs emissions where they are unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He receives a marginal amount of fees since the pool he is voting for is processing a marginal volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is the same in reverse for voting on a high-volume pool that would be of interest to the DEX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Curve, this DEX-aligned voter will receive the same amount of 3CRV as anyone holding the same bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Velodrome, this DEX-aligned voter will be well rewarded, as he will be a majority voter on a high-volume pair: an ideal situation to maximize fees earned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both sides, bribes are paid to voters and can lead to situations where votes are directed to pools that are not optimal in terms of volume processed. However, on Curve, there is no penalty for doing so. On Velodrome, bribers of such pools compete with high-volume pools offering attractive APR to voters, with or without bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing, from another angle: on Curve, the cost of bribes depends only on the value of CRV emissions. On Velodrome, the baseline price a project must pay to gather votes depends on the total bribes + fees collected on other pools. This means that high-volume pools push the cost of bribes upward, entertaining yet another flywheel in the flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the above means understanding the core difference between the Curve and Velodrome models. However, to get the full picture, more elements must be considered. Let’s discuss the LP boost now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;b-lp-boosts--its-impact-on-the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;B/ LP boosts &amp;amp; its impact on the ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LP boost, as it is called, is a Curve-specific feature. Many protocols forking the veCRV tokenomics, such as Balancer with its veBAL, also use it. It enables veCRV holders to earn more CRV rewards on their LP, factoring in several elements, including the size of their veCRV bag and the size of their various LPs. Thus, with appropriate veCRV ownership, an LP can get an “LP Boost” of up to 2.5x compared to the base emission rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b1-lp-boost-explained&#34;&gt;B.1/ LP Boost explained
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize the boost obtained, up to 2.5x maximal, one must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own as much veCRV as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have LP positions in as many pools as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a proportionate/balanced amount of TVL in those various pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simply put, LP Boost is a rugged game from the get-go&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not designed to benefit individual veCRV holders over their LP but to attract meta-protocol, such as Convex, who can achieve 1+2+3 consistently. &lt;strong&gt;The growth of Convex is not a success story; it is by design (Curve’s design)&lt;/strong&gt;. If it were not for Convex, another similar protocol would own most of the veCRV supply. We observed similar patterns with other protocols that adopted LP Boost: Balancer has Aura. Convex and Aura control &amp;gt; 50% of the veCRV/veBAL supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome and Aerodrome completely avoid the possibility of a new protocol to gobble up the supply by not having any boosting mechanism. As we’ve seen with Curve, Convex emerged and captured most of the supply; now, all LPs are earning with a boost, and none are benefiting from any disproportionate amount of CRV. The system has converged to everyone earning about the same effective boost, or in Velodrome/Aerodrome’s case, no boost since the future outcome would’ve been LPs earning the same effective boost. The other fact remains that since Convex has a majority of CRV locked, they control the future governance of CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;b2-consequences-of-lp-boost&#34;&gt;B.2/ Consequences of LP Boost
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the LP-Boost calls for a Convex-like layer on top of the DEX; there is no avoiding it. At this point, some could think: &amp;ldquo;So you have a protocol gobbling most of your emissions and locking them forever; what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s simply inefficient design since those meta-layers provide features that could be delivered less convoluted at the base level (by the DEX itself) and without the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve needs Convex and the bribe marketplace: Votium, Warden, and Hidden Hands. But also the auto-compounder/vote delegation manager: Airforce Union, Concentrator, etc. You end up with dozens of protocols taking some fees here and there to deliver something that Velodrome manages to pack in natively. This makes the experience more complex for the users, who must know about these dozens of protocols and their subtleties to make the most of Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember how, while discussing the fee distribution, we mentioned that Curve required a much more dense infrastructure to operate? Well, imagine the mess that veCRV+LP Boost is in the backend. There is a reason why both Curve and Balancer are taking ages to ship on a new L2, and often with partial functionality (such as no LP boost, surprise surprise.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;seamlessly-expanding-beyond-what-curve-offers&#34;&gt;Seamlessly expanding beyond what Curve offers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Velodrome, the bribe marketplace is built-in: projects can post their bribes directly on the Velodrome frontend, and voters can check available bribes and vote in the same place. New features keep being delivered and added to the same interface used by all participants: LPs, projects, and tokenholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;velodrome-relays&#34;&gt;Velodrome Relays
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go from quality-of-life / gas-saving upgrades, such as the “auto-max-lock”, saving lockers for those who wish to remain max-locked to maximize their gauge-voting power the hassle of doing it manually, to much more extensive features, like Relay, a veVELO position management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/relay.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;velodrome-relay&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tool catering to projects using Velodrome to grow liquidity on their pairs. It enables them to set up their voting and bribing strategy and implement it automatically: no need to submit weekly transactions anymore. Relay has another benefit, since currently, the strategy available is a veVELO-maxi one, compounding all fees &amp;amp; bribes collected into VELO and relocking it to maximize voting power: it creates a sizeable VELO sink, directly indexed on the fees distributed by the exchange. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1762908204894445834&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Almost 1/5 of all veVELO are already there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Relay feature matures, more strategies will be available to its users, including some that compound all the fees and bribes earned into veVELO but, for instance, make them claimable in ETH or USDC. It will prove very convenient for veVELO holders that are not looking to support a project in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;venft-tokenized-locked-positions&#34;&gt;veNFT: Tokenized locked positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velodrome has other neat innovations packed in, such as the still under-appreciated veNFT: with Curve, veCRV is non-transferable, making their management painful. Velodrome can achieve the same alignment but enables transferability: veVELO positions are represented by a veNFT that can be transferred. There is no way of redeeming a given veNFT for the underlying VELO tokens apart from waiting for the lock to expire. However, it eases the management of such a position by enabling its transfer. There is also &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decode.market/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an OTC market for veVELO veNFTs&lt;/a&gt;, where holders can sell their position to interested buyers at a fluctuating discount compared to the value of underlying VELO tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-deep-understanding-of-the-nature-of-the-game&#34;&gt;A deep understanding of the nature of the game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges like Curve or Velodrome are a particular product type in the DeFi landscape. In regular business terms, &lt;strong&gt;they could be described as B2B2C: Business to Business to Consumer&lt;/strong&gt;. They are B2B because their first customers are other projects – the various protocols looking for liquidity. If they successfully service this market, the projects they onboard to their DEX will do the B2C work for them, as their liquidity pools present opportunities to their respective token holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, I feel like Curve utterly failed. With its pyramid of solutions nested on top of one another, Curve is particularly unfriendly to onboard for projects. They wanna bribe? All right, decide between veCRV or vlCVX bribes on Bribe.crv, Votium, Warden, or StakeDAO. Do they want to manage their own CRV? Fine, just pick between veCRV, aCRV, cvxCRV, sdCRV, vlCVX, uCRV, etc. While this myriad of options might ravish Curve-enthusiasts, it turns, in my perspective, into a negative quality for the B2B side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the experience with Velodrome is seamless: one place where everything happens, one option for each – without needing to compare between half a dozen cryptic and sometimes misleading alternatives. Coupled with the previous characteristics of the veCRV games discussed before, especially the LP Boost, it makes the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/farewell-glc/#the-case-of-the-crv-wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve ecosystem particularly unfriendly to new entrants&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;who would want to enter a race rigged in favor of the first entrants three years after it began&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/crv-vs-velo/tour-de-op.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tour-de-op&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Velodrome BD efforts are remarkable; the team is broadly available to help onboard new projects, and several programs are designed to make the experience as simple and compelling for new entrants, regrouped under the “Tour de OP” umbrella, which includes a bribe matching program, lock bonuses and vote boosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;PARTING WORDS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might have seen, both Velodrome &amp;amp; Aerodrome have attracted much attention lately, thanks to their token seeing positive momentum: I think it&amp;rsquo;s well deserved. The release of Slipstream, Velodrome’s implementation of Concentrated Liquidity, will increase the volume processed per unit of TVL, unlocking the flywheel&amp;rsquo;s next growth phase. Aerodrome, Velodrome’s fork on the Base network, has seen spectacular growth since it launched six months ago, further demonstrating the model&amp;rsquo;s viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the Velodrome team is starting to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-metadex-48e4af1ef9a4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;refer to Velo as a &amp;ldquo;MetaDEX&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at Velodrome becoming the base liquidity hub not just of Optimism but for the whole Superchain: all chains built on the OP stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell, but Velodrome is already a resounding success on Optimism, so managing a cross-chain DEX properly would be a game changer. This is especially true considering how much Curve &amp;amp; Balancer has failed there—not because they did not try, but simply because their convoluted infrastructure with LP boost makes cross-chain deployment painful (Hello AuraFinance distributing AURA on chains where&amp;hellip; there is no liquidity for $AURA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I’m addressing the DEX part of the product suite here, which is the complete product for Velodrome but not for Curve, which now has crvUSD and Llamalend. Still, even with crvUSD included, Aerodrome is now collecting and redistributing more fees than Curve, all of this while being present on one chain only vs 13 for Curve. While Curve-DEX has been sub-par for a while, the team has repeatedly proven innovative and able to bounce back. crvUSD revenues have already flipped those of Curve-DEX, and who knows what Llamalend could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game on: let’s wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Farewell to the GHO Liquidity Committee and reflections on the rise of DeFi newspeak</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/farewell-glc/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/farewell-glc/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve resigned from the GHO Liquidity Committee and would like, in this blog post, to share more context on its adventures and the learning we can draw from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/verifySig/35543&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Signer removal transaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those whose first reaction will be “ain’t ready all of that,” here is a recap of the main shortcoming I see in the committee that led to my decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s operating model is inefficient and prevents a coherent vision from emerging and being delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s scope of responsibilities is unclear, leading to a passive attitude (towards governance mishaps) assumed by most members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The committee mainly comprises governance professionals who lack any serious expertise in the topic at play – liquidity management. It results in inefficient operations, conflicts of interest because of their numerous other commitments, and subpar use of the Committee’s resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance is always a challenge. Indeed, it can seem insane to give power to random people on the internet, and it often is. There is a built-in democratic assumption in governance operations – although most governances are purely plutocratic – that severely hinders any serious structuration that would enable delivering upon commonly agreed goals. The GHO Liquidity Committee was appointed by the Aave governance precisely because it recognized – in a flash of lucidity – its incompetence and ineptitude in directional liquidity management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I’ll tell you what’s even crazier: giving power to people that the crowds perceive as “experts” on a topic. It’s all a show: the most recognized and mediatic expert of a given field is never the one actually the most informed on the topic. I, for one, would know quite a bit on the matter, with my own field of specialization — liquidity management, shaping, and incentivization — a topic prone to public perception manipulation more than any other because of the financial stakes inherently associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-case-of-the-crv-wars&#34;&gt;The case of the CRV Wars
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s illustrate: regarding liquidity, the word on the street is that Curve is the best model, and all pros and experts use Curve, right? &lt;strong&gt;It’s so good that over the last round (62), projects are spending $1 to receive $0.7 of incentives to their pools&lt;/strong&gt;: an instant donation of 30% of the amount they spend on bribes to veCRV/vlCVX holders. It means that if projects which bribed would have allocated the same amount to direct liquidity mining instead, they would have delivered 30% more $ to their LPs and thus attracted more liquidity for the same cost, all of which without assuming the price risk associated with CRV fluctuations for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s happening there? Quite a few things, and it’s not the main course on today’s menu, just the appetizer, so I’ll go over this quickly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most projects have no one internally competent with liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;, so they often do random wastes like these. Many prominent DeFi projects recognized for the liquidity games are big spenders but not exactly savvy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curve Wars have been a meme for a while&lt;/strong&gt;: there have been no genuine new entrants in these wars for ages – simply because it’s not worth it financially for most players, especially those without ties to the Curve ecosystem. Moreover, the liquidity structures available on Curve (stableswap and V2) are suboptimal compared to Uniswap or Maverick for many very common types of DeFi tokens – LSDs, LRTs, loosely pegged stablecoins, and liquid wrappers. You can confidently mark any protocol outputting a token of this type building liquidity primarily on Curve as inapt in liquidity management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you are left with are &lt;strong&gt;“insider protocols,”&lt;/strong&gt; teams building on top of the Curve ecosystem who usually own sizeable veCRV/vlCVX positions, allowing them to recoup a large share of their bribes (1. Own veCRV/vlCVX ⇒ 2. Post a bribe ⇒ 3. Vote on the pool you just bribed ⇒ 4. Collect and repeat next round). This tactic manipulates public perception into thinking that real money is being spent on these Curve wars. Some of these now insiders are originally external protocols, such as Inverse or Alchemix, which decided to kiss the llama ring for the better and the worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take my word for it; simply look at the top spenders: Frax, Convex, Alchemix, CLever (Aladin), Prisma, Conic, Inverse, etc. &lt;strong&gt;To make it easy to visualize, here are the top spenders of the last round, ranked by amount spent, with the insider protocols highlighted in red&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with Curve, llamas already hate me; I just wanted to highlight the example of Curve, “the king of liquidity,” being a poorly efficient venue to build and sustain liquidity. Curve, “maker or breaker of stablecoins,” as the DEX with arguably subpar liquidity structures for most stablecoin pools: &lt;strong&gt;Newspeak arrived in DeFi, and public perception/words used are often entirely at odds with the onchain observable reality&lt;/strong&gt;. Sadly, a similar pattern has been observed with the GHO Liquidity Committee, today&amp;rsquo;s topic, so let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-case-of-the-gho-liquidity-committee&#34;&gt;The case of the GHO Liquidity Committee
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GHO Liquidity Committee is a prime example of expertise misplacement&lt;/strong&gt;, as it was composed of an unhealthy mix of professionals “DeFi politicians” (more on this below), people with low expertise and vested interest in a given DEX, and people close to the Aave’s DAO / ex Aave team but devoid of any expertise on the topic of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It led to a waste of resources, baseless struggles, and heavily misinformed decisions. At the end of the day, the &lt;strong&gt;GLC is like a big bag of cash everyone was trying to pull from to direct to protocol they have an interest in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive in: what were its limitations, and what anyone interested in governance, whether committee-based or not, can learn from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;operating-model-of-the-glc&#34;&gt;Operating model of the GLC
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first months, the GLC operated erratically, sometimes leading several initiatives that were at odds with each other and needed a more coherent vision. It was simply a bunch of degens with a large amount of GHO in a multisig &lt;strong&gt;spraying and praying&lt;/strong&gt;. The pinnacle was reached when bribes were allocated to a pool whose liquidity shape was detrimental to the repegging efforts, which, luckily for the Committee, ended out of range before the emissions began, enabling its prompt termination: a net burn of GHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eventually elected head of the committee and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/TokenBrice/status/1719328410479059227?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;assumed a temporary and objective-based dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;. It enabled the committee to stop allocating resources on liquidity support that were doing a disservice to the cause of repegging GHO and &lt;strong&gt;focus the energy, resources, and efforts where it actually mattered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the story also raised eyebrows and attracted media attention (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/28/aaves-gho-stablecoin-nears-elusive-dollar-peg/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/benevolent-dictator-succeeds-in-bringing-aave-s-stablecoin-gho-near-parity-with-usd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiant&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) as it highlighted the failure of governance by itself – at least from the perspective of said media. &lt;strong&gt;During my two mandates, two targets were set: the first was missed by a few basis points (after an increase of ~200 bps), and the second was missed by a few days&lt;/strong&gt;. My targets were ambitious, especially considering that they relied as much on deliverables external to the liquidity committee (interest rate management, single-sided staking for GHO, etc.). After two terms, I let go of the leading role early in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ When governance elects a committee to handle a specific task, it acknowledges its inefficiency on the matter. &lt;strong&gt;Such committees should not shy away from appointing a leadership, as ownership and responsibility can be very healthy,&lt;/strong&gt; especially in “decentralized” governances where the eminences are often gray, and thus ownership and responsibility often lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scope-of-the-glc&#34;&gt;Scope of the GLC
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLC inherited several “governance debts”: decisions made by the governance that prove absolutely indefensible in the current state of affairs and operations. It failed even to find the will to challenge them and instead decided to enforce them despite the warning of a couple of committee members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Mobilizing the CRV of the committee as sdCRV, a subpar option at the technical level, as it requires weekly voting of the committee (no vote carry-over), has low liquidity, and strips the committee of its due CRV gauge voting power unless it owns veSDT / benefits from a veSDT boost delegation, all of that in a lovely ethical mess, as it strengthens ties with a protocol/team that operates with many questionable practices and several committee members are veSDT holders and in proximity with the said team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-professionalism-means-in-defi-newspeak&#34;&gt;What “professionalism” means in DeFi newspeak
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in groups such as the GHO Liquidity Committee are expected to be “professionals” — you, dear readers, and I would understand by that: master of their topic, accurate, always trying to serve the committee&amp;rsquo;s purpose, and available for their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re misplaced, as in DeFi newspeak, “professionalism” has an entirely different meaning; it’s actually the opposite, as DeFi “professional” profiles tend to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make no waves, and avoid anything perceived as “political”, even if that means associating with scammers: you cannot put business partners in a tough spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence truths that are hard to swallow but would be of public interest to enable the community to learn from previous mistakes. For instance, &lt;strong&gt;the failure of the developers of GHO to anticipate the depeg is never discussed&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it had been expected by many – myself included — up to one year before GHO’s launch. The interest rate model and the absence of a GHO single staking option at the launch were both apparent lacks that any competent stablecoin developer should have anticipated and resolved &lt;strong&gt;before launch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harness structures such as the GLC to promote the protocol they have vested interests in by all means possible, even if that means arriving at situations that, if described honestly, would qualify as conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate, by their onchain initiatives and the communication they share in private groups, an approximate, if not missing, understanding of the topic of their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⇒ Participants in governance should learn how to place their trust better. Thanks to their existing platforms, the most publicly visible figures are usually selected when committees are elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presence in this committee was an oddity that emerged out of necessity, as governance knew that a deep understanding of liquidity shaping, especially Maverick, was needed to give the GLC the best chances of success. Many actual experts hanging around governance forums and Discords remain powerless despite their knowledge and good intentions simply because they are not well-known figures in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rise-of-defi-politicians-and-its-consequences&#34;&gt;The rise of DeFi politicians and its consequences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance is a theater. Anyone involved in DeFi knows that, but even myself was surprised to realize the extent of the scenarization of governance interactions. Just like IRL politics, where we have professional politicians devoid of expertise about the topics they are handling, we’re observing the same phenomenon in DeFi, where a caste of politicians is assuming an increasing responsibility over various DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such profiles specialize in governance-related operations and operate exactly like the IRL PR specialists: their primary care is about public perception and how to manipulate it to achieve their purpose&lt;/strong&gt; (usually obtaining the allocation of a sizeable budget from the DAO to their governance structure). Governance discussion is not happening publicly on the forum — the forum is just a stage. The actual discussions are happening backstage: in calls, IRL meetings, and DMs. Discussions on the forum are avoided as much as possible, especially if they are anticipated to be controversial. The forum is simply here to record previously and privately discussed matters: look at the conversations on most proposals: they look so fake that, at this point, one could suspect bots are talking to one another, which once again reminds me of IRL politics. It happened to me several times that such a profile contacted me as I was typing an answer to their governance post, trying to avoid any form of public discourse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⇒ Confirmed DeFi politicians (= those who earn their money mostly/only through governance-related activities) should simply be banned from participating in any structure having even a remote power – as they are the bane of decentralization, the devil in Prada of DeFi. The professionalization of governance is synonymous with its capture and thus centralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1710510768469237827?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hayden puts it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;governance stands at the bottom of the tier list in terms of decentralization and thus should be a solution of last resort.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only is it inefficient, but it’s also simply too prone to be manipulated, and the probability of it happening increases with the power and resources the governance manages. &lt;strong&gt;Once a given governance has grown enough, its corruption is simply unavoidable&lt;/strong&gt;, at least under the current dominant plutocratic governance model: 1 token = 1 vote, hello stone age of governance we’ve been seemingly stuck at for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, allow me one last analogy with IRL politics since we’ve established that similar actors participate in DeFi’s governance. Governance professionals love to dismiss ideas because they deem them “too political.” It enables them to appear as reasonable, non-aligned figures. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;non-alignment does not exist: every decision is political&lt;/strong&gt;. Those who say otherwise usually tend to be positioned at the “extreme-center” end of the spectrum: a brutal profit maximalist alignment wrapped in a costume of gentle neutrality, aka the DeFi equivalent of an Emmanuel Macron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to committees appointed by governance, I am unlikely to participate in any other after this one – unless its scope is clearly defined and it&amp;rsquo;s given the means to challenge governance&amp;rsquo;s suboptimal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing my next step: contributing to a DeFi mastermind geared to support trustless and unstoppable DeFi: The DeFi Collective</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-collective/</link>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-collective/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/defi-collective/twitter_banner.png" alt="Featured image of post Introducing my next step: contributing to a DeFi mastermind geared to support trustless and unstoppable DeFi: The DeFi Collective" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://deficollective.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Proudly introducting The DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, financial systems have been mismanaged by states, corrupted by entrenched private interests, and unable to deliver an equitable, fair, and transparent baseline to enable unfettered value exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over five years ago, I discovered the (back then) nascent decentralized finance ecosystem and was promptly convinced it embodies a credible attempt to deliver a neutral value exchange layer, freed from the influence of states and able to resist the corruption attempts of private actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Ethereum network provides a neutral ledger, enabling users to transact in a purely peer-to-peer fashion. Its ability to support smart contracts allows for the creation of various protocols for more advanced use cases — some of which can approach the network&amp;rsquo;s resilience level, such as Uniswap, a financial primitive providing infrastructure for the permissionless exchange of any token that will operate as long as the Ethereum network synchronizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I progressively became more engaged and committed to upholding and delivering on this vision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2018, I started to write and share about DeFi on various mediums, and eventually launched this blog a couple of years later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In late 2019, with friends, we launched &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/defi_fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi France&lt;/a&gt; to nurture a supportive environment to broaden adoption and involvement in DeFi amongst the French-speaking communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2020, I started to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@DeFiFrance/featured&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;host live shows in French&lt;/a&gt; to document the most relevant DeFi protocols and deepen the users’ comprehension of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, in 2022, I joined the Liquity team, to help grow the adoption of LUSD, a critical piece of infrastructure in my perspective, as it remains the most resilient stablecoin available to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proudly-introducing-the-defi-collective&#34;&gt;Proudly introducing The DeFi Collective
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to introduce my latest commitment to help the DeFi ecosystem deliver on its initial promises: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DeFiCollective_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The DeFi Collective&lt;/a&gt;. The DeFi Collective attempts to solve a structural imbalance that could ultimately lead DeFi to fail to deliver on its core values. DeFi suffers from an inherent tension between delivering on its base values and the concessions some think are needed for growth and adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widely adopted protocols are rarely the most resilient, and we at the Collective believe it stems from an incentive misalignment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams who tightly control their protocol (usually through multisigs) and harness aggressive tokenomics models tend to have more firepower to attract capital and promote themselves than those who value security and sturdiness above all else. We picture the Collective as a critical resource in reverting this imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nonprofit-association-to-support-the-sturdiest-defi-protocols&#34;&gt;A nonprofit association to support the sturdiest DeFi protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? It’s straightforward; you’ll see that the &lt;strong&gt;DeFi Collective delivers a competitive edge, allocated only to the highest-quality DeFi protocols.&lt;/strong&gt; Protocols that ensure open, transparent, and resilient public infrastructures will receive the support of the DeFi Collective, free of charge and without conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeFi Collective is a Swiss nonprofit association incorporated in Zug, bound by its status to use its resources to support the most resilient and relevant DeFi protocols. What does this entail? The Collective will clarify and publish its “protocol guidelines” shortly after launch: any protocol that matches them is eligible for its support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what kind of support are we talking about? About all the critical expertise a protocol needs to harness to grow and thrive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness and education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrations and networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal &amp;amp; self-policing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Collective is &lt;strong&gt;a group of experts that cannot be hired; instead, it self-appoints on protocols that match its demanding guidelines.&lt;/strong&gt; Embodied by the ants, The Collective intends to demonstrate that social coordination is paramount. Together, ants will build an ever-growing colony, acting as an organic mesh network nurturing an ecosystem where trustless DeFi can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ants-like-and-harness-liquidity-driving-tokens&#34;&gt;Ants like and harness liquidity-driving tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deliver on its vision, The Collective received support from top-notch teams that align with it, including Liquity, Maverick, CatInaBox, Diva, DYAD, Zero &amp;amp; Retro. &lt;strong&gt;It enables the Collective to be self-sustainable from day one, and able to direct and sustain over $25M of assets in liquidity pools of relevant DEXes across various layers,&lt;/strong&gt; including mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM &amp;amp; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Collective controls sizable liquidity-driving positions, including veVELO, vlLIQ, vlAURA, veRAM, veZERO, veRETRO &amp;amp; more, and manages treasuries on all the networks mentioned above, to support the liquidity of relevant tokens through liquidity-driving votes and liquidity-providing activities. The Collective adheres to extremely risk-averse treasury management practices intended to preserve and grow its capital in a manner that is synergistic with its goals and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-liquidity-management&#34;&gt;Beyond Liquidity Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management and support is a critical area of expertise for the Collective that I will champion, along with governance-related activities to increase the adoption of the tokens from the supported protocols across the broader DeFi ecosystem. However, the DeFi Collective is an adventure much bigger than myself, and I am blessed with the support of two equally critical founding board members – Nils Bundi and Florian Prantl, who deliver on their expertise in their respective areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-bundi-6246b998/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nils Bundis&lt;/a&gt; is a DeFi protocol architect and developer with a background in financial engineering. As an experienced DeFi builder, he knows the challenges of building “truly decentralized” protocols. Apart from the technical depth, Nils will also support the Collective with his expertise in the operational requirements, ensuring secure and trusted DeFi services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/floowp_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Floria Prantl&lt;/a&gt; is a lawyer and policy specialist with a background in advising DeFi and CeFi projects, navigating the legal and regulatory pitfalls in setting up and expanding their services. He also brings valuable experience advocating with authorities for progressive and balanced regulations. At the Collective, he particularly lends his expertise to operational compliance, offering guidance to supported protocols and contributing to the Collective&amp;rsquo;s self-policing, networking, and other vital initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their skills and knowledge will help the Collective to conduct research, establish and promote self-policing guidelines, and entertain any other relevant activities deemed necessary to deliver on &lt;strong&gt;its vision of supporting the existing resilient and DeFi-aligned protocols and foster an ecosystem where protocol builders have increased incentives to walk the path of sturdiness, immutability, and resilience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-streamlined-infrastructure-kept-in-check&#34;&gt;A streamlined infrastructure, kept in check
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All board members and contributors to the Collective are capped to a commitment accounting for at max 50% of their working hours. This policy was designed to keep the structure in check and avoid situations where the preservation/growth of the structure is given more priority than achieving its end goals, which is often seen in public institutions and associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors have agreed to compensation well below the market rate for their efforts. Boardmembers are not compensated for their activity. This enables the Collective to minimize its starting expenses and aggressively compounds its earnings to grow its onchain treasuries, giving it more means to deliver on its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DeFi Collective is now my main focus and commitment&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that I will sadly no longer be able to contribute directly to Liquity as a team member. It was not an easy decision to make. Still, it was necessary to enable me to keep focusing on my areas of expertise (liquidity management and governance) and keep growing them. As one of the most resilient lending infrastructures available, the Liquity protocol matches the Collective guidelines and will be part of the supported protocols amongst several others to be introduced shortly. The Collective will thus be able to support Liquity’s growth and expansion with liquidity-management-related activities and help LUSD get more broadly supported across DeFi protocols and L2.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/stablecoin-marauder-map/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/stablecoin-marauder-map-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Maurauder&#39;s Map of Decentralized Stablecoins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild new stablecoins are constantly appearing, and with the multiplication of chains, layers, and viable stablecoin models the trend is not stopping anytime soon. &lt;strong&gt;Navigating the stablecoin landscape is turning into a critical skill for DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized stablecoin models are easier to evaluate, decentralized stablecoins harness various complex mechanisms, making it harder to compare their data face to face. Yet, dozens of relevant new decentralized stablecoins are appearing yearly, and I don’t expect the trend to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, this article intends to provide a marauder map to help navigate the landscape of decentralized stablecoin designs. Before combing through the innovations for decentralized stablecoins, allow one more minute to the context: why do we care so much about (decentralized) stablecoins in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;size-matters&#34;&gt;Size matters
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins are cryptocurrency’s top product-market fit by a wide margin&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi is cool, right? We love it on this blog. Yet size-wise, there are about 3 times more value locked in stablecoins than in DeFi protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the total TVL in DeFi is around $38B for $124B of stablecoins circulating, serviced mainly by centralized options: USDT makes 66% of the total, and USDC is another 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dive in! As we consider the various designs harnessed to deliver decentralized stablecoins, I’ll illustrate the mechanisms discussed using examples from live projects: picture this article as recipe book meets marauder map on the topic of decentralized stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-decentralized-stablecoin&#34;&gt;HOW TO BUILD A DECENTRALIZED STABLECOIN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a virtually infinite range of designs that can be harnessed to output decentralized stablecoins; however, they all rely on two essential core needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Price Stabilization&lt;/strong&gt; | Finding an effective way to stabilize the stablecoin price without too much compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; | The active management of the liquidity on the stablecoin to maximize its effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both themes address the same need: ensuring that the stablecoin can be traded at peg whatever the circumstances, they operate on different time frames. Stabilization mechanisms are built so that stablecoins tend to their peg over the mid/long time-frames. Liquidity strategies are here to ensure even sizable amounts of the stablecoin can be bought/sold as close as possible to the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are two prerequisites for a stablecoin design to be relevant and have a chance at gathering traction. Faults on those two dimensions jeopardize the whole design, so let’s look at the leading price stabilization mechanisms harnessed and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;price-stabilization-mechanisms&#34;&gt;PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISMS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with sizable demand, decentralized stablecoins can depeg - that is, divert from the peg, usually $1, either upwards or downwards. While similar, the two depegs stem from vastly different design challenges. Let’s start with the most common, the depeg when a $ stable is worth less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;underpegging-illustrated-with-gho&#34;&gt;Underpegging illustrated with GHO
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually happens when the stablecoin is mainly used for leverage and lacks significant direct use cases – &lt;strong&gt;a current prime example is Aave’s GHO, trading around $0.97&lt;/strong&gt;. GHO is one of the cheapest stablecoins to borrow (1.5% max APY), creating a lot of initial demand for it. Yet, there is not much to do with GHO directly apart from providing liquidity. Thus, many borrowers swap their GHO for something else, for instance, DAI, to harness the 5% yield from the DSR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the AaveDAO has been slow to take action to support GHO. Despite the stablecoin being live since mid-July, there are still very few incentives directed to growing GHO’s liquidity, and they are poorly allocated as most of them focus on stableswap pools where GHO is overweight because of its price. Since these pools are 80% composed of GHO, they provide little adequate liquidity at the current price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/gho-balancer-pool.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gho-balancer-pool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the only pressure for GHO to repeg comes from the existing borrowers who could consider repaying their debt with a ~3% discount if they could borrow and swap GHO around $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GHO will need attractive earning options directly available in GHO to approach the peg again, such as liquidity-providing options. Still, a GHO-based staking module with revenue sharing would fit the task nicely. Overall, we need more GHO-sinks: mechanisms resulting in GHO being minted and held as such for long periods. Right now, it seems like governance is pushing forward increased support for GHO’s liquidity incentives and a potential GHO PSM (Peg Stability Module): more on this design is below while we address Maker/DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was launched a few weeks ago, most of GHO’s current challenges come from its young age, coupled with a lack of preparation for the launch on the DAO side. The DAO is improving in that regard, with many propositions pushed forward to address the situation, including establishing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a liquidity committee for GHO&lt;/a&gt; I should contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overpegging-illustrated-with-lusd&#34;&gt;Overpegging illustrated with LUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; utilizes a unique mechanism called Redemptions to maintain its price stability. In Liquity, users deposit their ETH as collateral to borrow and mint stablecoins (LUSD). The key innovation lies in the redemption mechanism, which enables users to redeem LUSD for the underlying collateral (ETH) at a fixed ratio, even if the market price of ETH drops significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism incentivizes users to stabilize the price of LUSD by redeeming it when ETH prices are low, thereby reducing the circulating supply of LUSD and supporting its peg to the USD. It provides &lt;strong&gt;immediate and immutable access to LUSD’s collateral to LUSD holders&lt;/strong&gt; without the need for liquidity on a decentralized exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemptions provide an additional layer of guarantee to LUSD holders but add complexity on the borrowing side, pushing borrowers to monitor and adjust their LTV against other protocol users and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral redemptions provide the most direct access to the underlying backing of a stablecoin. Centralized stablecoins like USDC or USDT use a similar, although permissioned, mechanism to enable redeemability to USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD traded at a premium for most of its existence, even though the situation has improved recently. Indeed, several factors contributed to enhancing the liquidity and the peg pressure: the success of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chickenbonds.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chicken Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, advanced liquidity strategies on novel DEXes like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mav.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, or the accumulation of LUSD by DAOs and treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The why of the premium still needs to be pinpointed precisely. One of the likely main factors is that &lt;strong&gt;LUSD is servicing a unique niche&lt;/strong&gt;, the resilience-maximized stablecoin, where there is usually more demand (people wanting to hold LUSD) than offer (ETH holders borrowing LUSD and selling it). &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency#:~:text=LUSD%20is%20a%20stablecoin%20fully,also%20comes%20with%20scalability%20challenges.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This topic was covered in depth last year on Liquity’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While underpegging is usually more concerning, overpegging can have real consequences, too, as it can make effective borrowing costs less predictable for the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD’s overpeg stems from mostly psychological mechanisms: the worst case of sustained overpegging was observed during movements of market panic, especially when a prominent centralized stablecoin is perceived at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, thanks to its resilience, LUSD is seen as a &lt;strong&gt;safe haven stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. A remarkable feat, but it comes with a price: crowds rush to LUSD when other stablecoins are at fault, such as when USDC depegged 10% following the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank. LUSD saw an incredible trading volume that day, with sizeable purchases above $1.03, $1.04, and $1.05 as the market panicked. Amid the panic, some users are willing to pay a high price to fly to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dai-and-the-psm-solving-overpegging-for-a-price&#34;&gt;DAI and the PSM: solving overpegging, for a price
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its early days, before the Mutli Collateral Dai update, DAI had similar challenges to LUSD: it tended to overpeg. With the update, Maker introduced the Peg Stability Module (PSM) to manage the price stability of its stablecoin DAI. The PSM acts as a buffer between the market and the DAI ecosystem. It allows users to swap stable assets like USDC for DAI at a fixed exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the exchange rate in response to market dynamics, MakerDAO can influence the supply of DAI in the market and keep its price close to the USD peg. It helped MakerDAO resolve the DAI problem over pegging, observed before the PSM. Still, it came with a cost: an accumulation of USDC and other centralized stablecoins as DAI’s collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fraxs-amo-algorithmic-market-operations-scale-liquidity-and-risk-to-infinity&#34;&gt;FRAX&amp;rsquo;s AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations): scale liquidity and risk to infinity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRAX is a decentralized stablecoin that utilizes Algorithmic Market Operations to maintain its peg. FRAX employs an adaptive mechanism that adjusts its collateralization ratio based on market conditions. When the FRAX price trades above its peg, the system mints new FRAX and buys back collateral, increasing the stability of the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the FRAX price falls below the peg, it reduces the collateralization ratio to encourage users to mint FRAX, which helps restore the peg. AMOs come with additional risks, mainly depending on the usage of the assets minted without collateral: the riskier their exposure, the bigger the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal risks of such a design manifest when an issue with one of the services harnessed (usually money markets or DEX) arises. Say 10M FRAX are minted by the AMO and deposited into a money market to be borrowed by users. Now, the money market suffers an issue with one of its collateral and gets drained: there are now 10M more FRAX in open circulation with 0 collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigating this requires very active management of the AMOs - by humans, through a multisig, which is not ideal from a security perspective, as AMOs can mint FRAX at will with no backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crvusd-pegkeeper-a-better-psm&#34;&gt;crvUSD pegKeeper: a better PSM?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the peg-stability of crvUSD, Curve explored a path similar to the PSM, but slightly improved. Indeed, here, the need for users’ input is removed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker PSM, it’s still user-driven: when overpeg, users supply USDC as collateral to Maker PSM and mint DAI, helping to push its price back. If DAI was to underpeg, users could similarly buy DAI (below $1) to redeem it for 1 USDC, helping to restore its price to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crvUSD works similarly at a high level (if crvUSD&amp;gt;$1 =&amp;gt; mint, if crvusd&amp;lt;$1 =&amp;gt; burn) but does not require any input: the system stabilizes itself thanks to its pegKeepers contract. These special contracts can mint non-collateralized crvUSD under certain conditions and for specific use cases only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 pegKeepers, each plugged into a different pool of crvUSD paired against a redeemable centralized stablecoin: USDC. USDT, USDP &amp;amp; TUSD. When crvUSD is overpeg, they can mint crvUSD to trade into the associated pool, helping to push crvUSD price back to $1. When crvUSD is underpeg, the pegKeeper can repurchase crvUSD on their associated pool (using centralized stable balances accumulated during overpeg) and burn it to push crvUSD’s price back to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, pegKeepers accumulate a crvUSD debt to the protocol when the stablecoin is overpegged, to be ideally resorbed once crvUSD is underpeg. The key here lies in the balance, ensuring that the spread between the supply of crvUSD (incl. Pegkeeper debt) and the borrowed supply does not grow too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pegKeepers still pose a decent threat to the protocol, just like the FRAX’s AMO or Maker’s PSM, the risk seems more mitigated there. Yet, crvUSD is still quite a young stablecoin, and only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-management&#34;&gt;LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management, even just for a stablecoin, could be a good topic for a thesis. It’s one of the most misunderstood topics across the space. I wanted you, dear reader, to be aware of its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;liquidity-management-as-a-non-topic&#34;&gt;Liquidity management as a non-topic
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read this blog, you’ve likely already internalized that &lt;strong&gt;liquidity strategies are the heart of the storm of the stablecoin wars.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet, many teams have yet to attain this realization. They picture it as something of low criticality that the DAO will handle later, which is incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DAOs are not the best structure to manage liquidity, they tend to harness suboptimal solutions, overpay, and simply need more velocity to match the fast pace of the liquidity games. No surprise here; we’ve already established ages ago that &lt;strong&gt;DAOs/governance are a good fit for strategical (long-term) orientations but inapt at mid/short term (tactics) management,&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to the example of MakerDAO (where, despite the absurdity of it, MKR holders are still voting on the vault’s interest rate, a purely operational parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution would be for the DAO to &lt;strong&gt;appoint a liquidity committee&lt;/strong&gt; - a small team of liquidity specialists provided with a budget they can mobilize autonomously. The committee could be hired for a set term, while the DAO retains the right not to renew the committee or even revoke it similarly to other service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to look at the main stablecoin projects run by DAOs and see which one has a committee yet. As far as I know, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only Aave is finally considering it for GHO&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the increased agility and operational capacity provided by the committee, it also enables the DAO to be more structured and forward-planning in its liquidity approach, allowing it to explore partnerships and collaboration with more relevant actors, such as supporting an innovative DEX from day one at launch, instead of the many months required to explain the relevancy of the innovation to the DAO’s stakeholders and have a budget being voted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;competence-is-scarce&#34;&gt;Competence is scarce
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard truth about liquidity management is that competence is extremely scarce. This could explain why the topic needs to be better understood and rarely prioritized at the project&amp;rsquo;s design stage or later in the governance discussions. An apt liquidity manager must have an accurate understanding of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base liquidity structure model, x*y=k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom liquidity structures like stableswap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic concentrated liquidity, UNIv3 style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap liquidity management layer (Bunni, Merkl, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CL liquidity manager model (Gamma, Arrakis, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veCRV tokenomics &amp;amp; ecosystem // veBAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote marketplaces and bribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced concentrated liquidity, Maverick style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick incentives model (Boosted Pool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick tokenomics (veMAV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEX Aggregator landscape and pathing logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scope of tools, services, and protocols used for liquidity management is increasing exponentially, and very few actors are following closely&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s frequent to observe absurd spreads between the liquidity spending of two similar projects, with sometimes spreads of several orders of magnitude of difference in terms of $ invested / results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-attract-piles-of-ethlsds-onchain&#34;&gt;How to attract piles of ETH&amp;amp;LSDs onchain?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we focused on stablecoins harnessing the CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) model, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, where users must deposit collateral to contract debt directly against the protocol (every borrower on a CDP protocol mints their “own” debt). It’s an elegant design that enables the protocol to implement various devices to absorb the volatility of the collateral, thus maximizing the price inertia of the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-limits-of-cdp-based-stablecoin&#34;&gt;The limits of CDP-based stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet, CDP-based stablecoins come with one main downside: the over-collateralization requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to dampen the volatility of collateral such as ETH without any margin of error. For instance, on Liquity, the minimum collateralization ratio tolerated is 110%, yet the average ratio observed on the protocol is 226.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcollateralization is the central limit of the CDP model, and is hard to overcome. Indeed, lowering the collateralization requirement could attract more borrowers, increasing the risk scope of the stablecoin outputted. Thus, scaling a CDP-based stablecoin is a tough job. There are other relevant ideas to attract more borrowers, such as diversifying the collateral offering, as shown below. But here again, it comes with increased risks on the stablecoin, as seen with DAI, which observed a sizeable collateral degradation over the last years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, many projects are exploring approaches that could result in a stablecoin with fewer compromises than DAI while achieving a similar scale. Let’s consider a few directions currently explored to scale decentralized stablecoin further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;expand-the-collateral--chain-offering-liquity-forks&#34;&gt;Expand the collateral &amp;amp; chain offering: Liquity forks
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 is the year of the Liquity fork: many protocols were launched this year, harnessing a model more or less similar to Liquity, with some twists. These include Gravita, Prisma, Lybra, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;gravita&#34;&gt;Gravita
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gravita&lt;/a&gt;, probably the closest to the base Liquity model. Here, the focus is put on making the protocol more attractive to borrowers, with several welcome additions, including the possibility of borrowing using liquid staked ETH like stETH or rETH as collateral or the protocol being made available on L2 like Arbitrum. Of course, it’s a game of balance here, as the rule specified above still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conditions enforced on the borrowers dictate the guarantees provided to stablecoin holders&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;prisma-finance&#34;&gt;Prisma Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://prismafinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Prisma Finance&lt;/a&gt; is also exploring a similar approach, another Liquity fork enabling the usage of ETH-LSD as collateral, built by a team close to the Curve/Llama ecosystem. Components of the veTokenomics are also envisioned on the fee-sharing/governance token PRISMA, but they still need to be made live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lybra-finance&#34;&gt;Lybra Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lybra.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lybra&lt;/a&gt;, experimented with a lock/escrow model on their governance token LBR. While it seems to have initially worked nicely to attract a sizeable amount of capital, the challenge with such tactics is to sustain them over time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;dyad&#34;&gt;DYAD
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyadstable.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DYAD&lt;/a&gt;. This one is technically not a Liquity-fork per se, but more of a Liquity-inspired protocol, especially regarding the price stabilization mechanism of their stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge they are trying to solve is onboarding new collateral on a live CDP protocol without expanding the risk scope of the base protocol more than it needs to. To do so, DYAD introduces a &amp;ldquo;Social Licensing Layer,&amp;rdquo; essentially the governance layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it looks like none of the governance we&amp;rsquo;re used to: here, there is no governance token, so that it won&amp;rsquo;t be your usual plutocracy. Instead, governance power lies directly within the dNFT needed to use the protocol:  each dNFT gets to control a single &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; for each proposed collateral type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can change the position of this switch at any time from off to on or on to off and back again, as often as they want. A given collateral can comprise part of DYAD&amp;rsquo;s collateral basket if it maintains a 2/3 supermajority of &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; switches. The only way to increase your governance power is to control more dNFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYAD also gets bonus points for preserving immutability as much as possible. While the protocol can be changed since it can onboard new collateral, the whole governance layer is immutable. DYAD is not fully live yet, only dNFTs are, but I&amp;rsquo;m eager to see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping with the majors here: LSDfi was all the rage a few months ago, and we’ve seen many protocols providing options to leverage ETH-LSD launching lately. While this sub-market is likely already crowded, there’s room for a CDP-based model delivering a stablecoin slightly less resilient than LUSD but with additional features. The question is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-gentle-with-your-borrowers-llamacrvusd&#34;&gt;Be gentle with your borrowers: LLAMA/crvUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to create a sink for ETH/ETH-LSD: make the conditions more attractive to borrowers / soften the liquidation penalties. Indeed, one of the main innovations behind crvUSD lies with the liquidation model that differs vastly from other services providing leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLAMA (Lending Liquidating AMM Algorithm) replaces the usual liquidations with “soft liquidations”, where underwater borrowers are rebalanced across “bands,” each representing a different price segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides a sizeable protection against liquidations stemming from brutal but unsustained market movements. Instead of the sudden liquidations we’ve been used to, LLAMA&amp;rsquo;s soft liquidations are more gradual, as the collateral is progressively adjusted in proportion to its market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-it-rain-dai-saving-rate--variants&#34;&gt;Make it rain: Dai Saving Rate &amp;amp; variants
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why even bother improving your design when there are more direct paths forward? MakerDAO pioneered this idea of offering a “risk-free” yield to stablecoin holders to drive the demand: the DAI Saving Rate, currently at 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustaining it proves very costly for the DAO, which is increasingly pushed towards riskier but more lucrative collateral to keep afloat. A sizeable share of the collateral are now real-world assets (RWA) managed by custodians, some of which are slow or even fail to meet their yield or reporting obligations or simply sub-optimal (MakerDAO is currently earning 3% on its USDC while &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-raises-usdc-interest-rate-to-5/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;retail can score 5% with Circle&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, surprise, surprise: incentives work, at least at first. Thus, this brutal, low effort, and poorly efficient design over the long term is now spreading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirror.xyz/0xa486d3a7679D56D545dd5d357469Dd5ed4259340/1qSAAQtVdNCW_xn9cObEjwrQzFpwEshNrm0sjX0nkG8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Raft launched a similar concept at 6%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frax is also working on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-2xx-sfrax-governance-proposal/2585&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sFRAX / Frax Saving Rate targeting 5%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/maker-dsr-impact.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;maker-dsr-impact&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, time will tell for the impact of such design over the long run. The way I see it, these protocols are &lt;strong&gt;depleting most of their revenues to pay for acquisition on an ongoing basis&lt;/strong&gt; — they will lose most of the users acquired with DSR the minute they stop. They would have burned a massive amount of money to sustain the charade, money that could have been spent on strategic assets providing life-long incentives to the liquidity providers of their stablecoin, for instance. &lt;strong&gt;This design is a great tactic but one of the most short-sighted strategies I have ever seen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-shift-to-reserve-backed-stablecoin&#34;&gt;A shift to reserve-backed stablecoin?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shift is brewing! While CDP-based models, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, are flourishing, &lt;strong&gt;reserve-backed stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; are also getting increasingly considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as we highlighted above, there is an inherent tension in purely borrow–based / CDP stablecoins. To put it simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling a decentralized lending-based stablecoin requires attracting and retraining a sizeable amount of ETH / ETH-LSDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the more permissive the protocol is to borrowers, the less desirable the stablecoin its output will become.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of a CDP-based stablecoin depends entirely on its users&amp;rsquo; actions. Under the reserve model, the protocol directly manages the reserve and minting of stablecoins instead of individual positions. Thus, reserve-based models seem to offer a credible answer to CDP-based stable shortcomings, enabling the stablecoin supply to potentially scale more thanks to the native protocol reserve providing increased price inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s summarize this article by examining two prime examples of implementing a reserve-backed stablecoin model. I’ll keep it short and digestible and add resources for diving further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fx-leverage-with-no-fundind-costs--90-volatility-dampened-eth&#34;&gt;f(x): leverage with no fundind costs &amp;amp; 90% volatility dampened ETH
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;F(x) is a fascinating protocol freshly released! It’s a dual product, enabling stETH depositors to expose themselves to two types of assets in the proportion they desire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xETH: a “high-volatility leveraged ETH”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fETH: a “low-volatility floating stablecoin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to a CDP protocol, users deposit ETH (or stETH) to mint fETH or xETH. However, unlike Liquity/Maker/Other CDP, the user does not manage its position (a Trove). Instead, the protocol directly manages the stETH reserve. A redemption feature enables holders of fETH or xETH to reclaim the underlying stETH. However, how much they redeem depends on the system&amp;rsquo;s state, most notably its Net Asset Value: the overall value of stETH in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/protocolfx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;protocolfx&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched just a few weeks ago, the protocol is still in its early stages with about 1300 ETH of TVL, and the liquidity on fETH is still being worked on. A third token, FXN, the governance token of the protocol, is also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition of both xETH and fETH is relevant to me and should be met with demand once the protocol is more mature. In my view, along with crvUSD, it’s one of the most exciting releases we got stablecoin-wise this year: I’m just waiting for the right time to experiment-ape into xETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity-v2-protected-lsd-leveraging&#34;&gt;Liquity v2: protected LSD leveraging
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Liquity v2” (codename) is not live yet but has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zps__IMxtTs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduced by Robert Lauko at the last Stable Summit in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fETH, v2 will offer non-liquidatable leverage on ETH-LSD with no funding fee and even add downside protection. The novel, reserve-backed stablecoin the protocol will output is optimized for scaling. Its liquidity needs are also minimized since the protocol acts as a primary AMM for the stablecoin: users can mint and redeem the stablecoin for $1 of staked ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V2 is being built in public: if you’d like to learn more about it or even get involved, make sure to come by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/RCRp2CJR2S&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management is the nerve of the stablecoin wars: observe &amp;amp; analyze the strategies deployed by the projects you monitor – their effectiveness is one of the main drivers of the success of the underlying protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Follow the event surrounding GHO’s liquidity management on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave Governance Forum&lt;/a&gt; and try to articulate your thesis. If you can anticipate the repeg accurately, you get 3% of free profit waiting for your (GHO ~$0.97 to $1.00).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ BONUS-TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; GRAI, another stablecoin (Liquity fork), is currently trading at ~$0.985 with its redemption ceiling increasing over the next few weeks; a similar play can be considered there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSD-FI (protocols to leverage LSD) has been overcrowded over the last few months. Most protocols in the vertical are losing traction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the incentive structure of protocols like Gravita, Raft, or Lybra, and confront it with their growth metrics — try to evaluate the incentive structure that seems persistent versus the ones losing steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ~4 years of going autistic with the CDP-based model, it seems like the most savvy teams started to look another way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since Maverick is out, and a few days since the MAV token joined the fray. Yet, most of DeFi is still scratching its head regarding how Maverick delivers 2-3x the capital efficiency of its top competitor, Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the time was right for a deep dive into the innovations brought by the model and the new paradigm it fosters regarding liquidity management: &lt;strong&gt;liquidity shaping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-on-dex-more-like-tools-for-lp-to-express-themselves&#34;&gt;Innovations on DEX? More like tools for LP to express themselves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a decentralized exchange can innovate at two levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure&lt;/strong&gt;: the options offered to liquidity providers to design the supply activity that best matches their thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And/or &lt;strong&gt;the incentivization model&lt;/strong&gt;: the tools and modalities enabling DAOs &amp;amp; projects to incentivize customized or not liquidity structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most new DEX being released recycle an existing infrastructure and focus on innovating on only one dimension - usually the incentivization model - as seen recently with the wave of Solidly/Velodrome forks - &lt;strong&gt;[ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?](&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a few critical moments in the industry when a new DEX was released and provided &lt;strong&gt;critical innovation on both fronts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V1/V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; established a solid infrastructure for &lt;code&gt;x*y=k&lt;/code&gt; pools &amp;amp; basic incentivization model: 30 bps fees auto compounded &amp;amp; the possibility of having Liquidity Mining programs on the staked LP tokens (ERC20).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve&lt;/strong&gt; provided an innovative and efficient liquidity model for pegged assets (stableswap) while pioneering a ve/gauge-based model for liquidity provider incentivization introducing a revenue capture at the token level (admin fee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UniswapV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; delivered the tools to manage a more advanced liquidity structure harnessing concentrated liquidity efficiently and providing more flexibility fee-wise (1, 5, 30, 100 bps fees, not auto-compounded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally came &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/maverick-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which goes even further than UniswapV3 in the customization of the liquidity structure it provides, offers streamlined position management (native rebalancing) and an unprecedented level of control regarding incentivization options, marking the birth of a new paradigm: liquidity shaping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each core innovations &lt;strong&gt;enable more expressivity for LPs: they get access to increasingly refined and customized tools enabling even the most intricate thesis to find a proper medium to be expressed onchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, before diving into the depth of liquidity shaping, some pointers on Maverick are necessary. Indeed, to fully understand the impact of liquidity shaping on Maverick, you first need to master its liquidity structures and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-liquidity-structures&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S LIQUIDITY STRUCTURES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of Maverick&amp;rsquo;s critical innovations is its liquidity structures, enabling the exchange to reach an unprecedented level of capital efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick offers four options to LP that could be regrouped into two categories for simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static mode is similar to a UNIv3 liquidity providing across a custom range, with &lt;strong&gt;immensely more flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And three dynamic modes offer &lt;strong&gt;various flavors of rebalancing to LP&lt;/strong&gt; to optimize further their earning: left (follows price to the left), right (follows price to the right), and both (follows price both ways).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mavericks-static-mode-is-a-game-changer&#34;&gt;Why Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Static Mode is a game changer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many still have to understand how much of an improvement Maverick&amp;rsquo;s static mode is over UNIv3, so let us focus on it for a minute. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick table recapping the main difference to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Uniswap v3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Maverick Static Pools&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supply liquidity in an arbitrary custom range, even potentially only with one token&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Support an uneven liquidity distribution within that range&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports customized fees and width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 fees tiers, 1 width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Near-infinite fee/width tiers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports the creation of ERC-20-wrapped LP tokens to ease LP onboarding &amp;amp; incentivization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ (Boosted Pools)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the distribution of rewards (Liquidity Mining)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the weighted &amp;amp; customized distribution of rewards to LP (Liquidity Shaping)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like UniswapV3, Maverick supports supplying liquidity in &lt;strong&gt;an arbitrary custom range,&lt;/strong&gt; even potentially only with one token, for instance, an LP on ETH/USDC from $2000 to $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current price is below $2000 (at the time of writing: $1900), the LP will be supplied purely with ETH and progressively rebalances to USDC as the price moves upwards, ending entirely in USDC at $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about LPs that have an even more refined thesis? What about the LP that sees ETH in that range for a week but mainly in the $2150-2250 area? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice for him to be able to express this thesis through the liquidity structure he chooses? It is precisely what Maverick enables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot above, you see a distribution from $2000 to $2400 on the ETH/USDC pair; however, &lt;strong&gt;unlike Uniswap, which necessarily distributes liquidity evenly across the range, Maverick enables LPs to choose&lt;/strong&gt;. To better fit our LP thesis, most of the liquidity is concentrated over the three ticks covering the $2150-2250 price zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maximizing-the-expressivity-offered-to-lps&#34;&gt;Maximizing the expressivity offered to LPs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expressivity offered to LP on Maverick is virtually infinite. I expect to see some interesting use cases emerge soon, especially for the protocols that will harness Maverick from the get-go (&amp;ldquo;Maverick-native&amp;rdquo; protocols). For instance, y&lt;strong&gt;ou could envision Maverick as a price stabilization mechanism for a stablecoin or a pegged asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the stablecoin project controls some liquidity, it could supply it in very expressive ways in times of need to constraint the price range. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;buy wall&amp;rdquo; liquidity structure on LUSD: the whole liquidity of this LP is supplied on a single tick, the first one where LUSD is worth below 1.00 USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a current price &amp;gt;1.00 USDC, this LP is supplied 100% in USDC and acts like a buying reserve: if the price of LUSD falls, the LP will rebalance. Such positions are promising, as they can exert buy/sell pressure helping to better constrain peg assets within narrower ranges, which massively reduces the cost of their liquidity incentivization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-the-dynamic-modes&#34;&gt;What about the dynamic modes?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick dynamic modes offer a convenient and easy solution for LPs who maximize their exposure to market prices to maximize the volume processed. All three modes essentially harness the same structure but give different options to LP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price just one way (left or right) - there are tons of pairs where it makes a lot of sense, like wstETH/ETH (wstETH being &amp;ldquo;up-only&amp;rdquo; against ETH thanks to the staking yield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price both ways, a good match for LP looking to maximize adequate liquidity and fees collected at the expense of increased IL risk on the principal. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly suited for stable and pegged asset pairs, but not only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;Maverick delivers native rebalancing to its LP&lt;/strong&gt;, and here again, it goes above and beyond what preceded in terms of customization options. &amp;ldquo;Native&amp;rdquo; is the keyword here, meaning the rebalancing can be &lt;strong&gt;done cleverly and gas-efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. While this is not new by itself, here again, the devil lies in the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, LPs have no options: their liquidity is concentrated, but all LPs of a given pair are under the same regime. It eases the management, but kills the expressivity. With Uniswap, LPs can dynamically rebalance their position using third-party tools like Arrakis; it comes with sizable trust assumptions, potential fees, and hefty gas costs. It allows more expressivity but requires more active management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are some limits to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s liquidity rebalancing, based on a TWAP and with some delays to avoid manipulations, it remains a crucial tool to help LPs maximize the time effectively spent in range / in the current price tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-incentivization-model-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S INCENTIVIZATION MODEL: LIQUIDITY SHAPING
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the first fundamental innovation brought by Maverick - the unprecedented expressivity offered to LP in the design and management of their position - we can now explore Maverick&amp;rsquo;s second leg: its novel incentivization model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story here is both short and long. &lt;strong&gt;In short, Maverick provides the same level of customization at the incentivization layer as at the pool creation level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads us to a longer story, with examples to be more explicit. Replicating most existing liquidity structures and incentivization models on Maverick is possible. But what&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting are the new ones previously never tried because they were not technically feasible before Maverick: it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-contract-triggered-buysell-walls&#34;&gt;Dynamic contract-triggered buy/sell walls
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the example from earlier about the stablecoin project posting liquidity as a buying wall to constrain the price? &lt;strong&gt;The project does not even needs its liquidity to do it&lt;/strong&gt;, as the same process can be replicated with a boosted pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project creates a boosted pool where all the liquidity is distributed on one tick below the price like above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project supplies incentives to the boosted pool for the duration of its choice &amp;amp; apes will do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can be automated and triggered entirely through smart contracts, meaning another contract could dynamically manage the incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-cvxcrvcrv&#34;&gt;The case of cvxCRV/CRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s study another checkmate case, the one of cvxCRV. Indeed, the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool is the absolute worst offender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;a regular structure, absolutely sub-optimal for an asset trading in a constrained range like cvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; liquidity mining model where all LPs are paid equally&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to cvxCRV deposits, which make 75% of the pool, earning 75% of the rewards - while being close to useless liquidity-wise (as there are already too much cvxCRV in that pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-can-be-done-better&#34;&gt;So what can be done better?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the concentration could be finetuned much more at the liquidity structure level. cvxCRV is a &amp;ldquo;one-way asset&amp;rdquo;: you can wrap CRV to cvxCRV 1:1 through the Convex contracts, but converting cvxCRV to CRV is done on a DEX at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; This means cvxCRV has a price ceiling against CRV: in no world, cvxCRV could be worth &amp;gt;1 CRV, and the current price is around 0.95 CRV per cvxCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; The ideal structure for such a pool could be &lt;strong&gt;a concentration going from 1cvxCRV = 0.9 CRV to 1 cvxCRV = 0.99 CRV, offering vastly superior liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the incentivization layer, massive gains are to be made with a switch. Instead of paying all LPs equally while the pool is massively unbalanced, why not focus on those who bring the most value to the pool, aka the CRV component?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d go with two joint pools to best cover that pair incentivize-wise: &lt;strong&gt;first, a static LP over ten bins&lt;/strong&gt; centered around the current price - it provides room for the price to express itself with sufficient liquidity &amp;amp; this structure is already &amp;gt;100x more efficient than the existing Curve V2 pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; For the nail in the coffin, we can &lt;strong&gt;add a one-tick left-right pool one top to maximize liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of this example help you understand that if you take this pool to Maverick, the compounded effect of the superior liquidity structure with a vastly more efficient incentivization model leads to results from a different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently $54M TVL in Curve cvxCRV/CRV pool for a daily volume of around $300k daily (0.5% utilization). With a base incentive of 12% CRV, ~&lt;strong&gt;$6M of CRV tokens are expanded yearly to maintain this liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Maverick, a ~$500K  properly structured pool&lt;/strong&gt; ($250k static broad range + $250k left-right) &lt;strong&gt;would be sufficient to consistently process the $300k daily volume&lt;/strong&gt; with better prices than on Curve. Assuming the same incentivization intensity, &lt;strong&gt;it would cost $60k a year to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proto-liquidity-shaping-with-bunni&#34;&gt;Proto Liquidity Shaping with Bunni?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that, at this point, you get a better sense of why liquidity shaping is genuinely revolutionary, as it will allow another order-of-magnitude leap regarding the efficiency of both the liquidity structures and the incentivization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are earlier, less complete iterations on such a concept, provided by the liquidity manager built on top of UniswapV3 that allows incentivization on a customized range, for instance, rewards for LUSD/USDC LP, but only for the LUSD = 0.999 USDC to LUSD = 1.01 USDC range. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bunni.pro/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bunni&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those could be described as &amp;ldquo;proto liquidity shaping,&amp;rdquo; as they enable to force a specific price range but cannot apply different weights to each tick in that range: they are limited by the Uniswap V3 pool model that offers less flexibility than Maverick. In the end, both are quite complimentary as Bunni can be used to force a wide range, which can be further refined with a uneven static Maverick pool &amp;amp; finally maintained uber liquid at current price with a left-right on Maverick too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mav-token&#34;&gt;MAV TOKEN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clear perspectives on both the novel pool structure and incentivization model and their consequences, we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to add the last piece of a puzzle, one you&amp;rsquo;re likely more familiar with, but here too, there are key differences: the MAV token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released just a few weeks ago, the MAV token has been airdropped to early liquidity providers and protocol users. The initial airdrop is just &lt;strong&gt;the first of many&lt;/strong&gt;, and more are planned, for LPs, but also protocols harnessing Maverick or building on top of it. For more details on the intended distribution, check this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;As readers of this blog, I imagine you are extensively familiar with the veCRV model and its implications. If not, you&amp;rsquo;ve got some reading to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vemav--liquidity-directing-voting-vote-directed-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;veMAV &amp;amp; Liquidity Directing Voting (vote-directed liquidity shaping)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/vemav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;vemav&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the MAV token is sequential, currently in phase 1, where users can claim their drop, LP MAV, or lock it to obtain veMAV. &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 will introduce Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Directing Voting and mark the true beginning of the MAV races.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is, of course, the expressivity enabled by Maverick that will also impact the tokenomics: unlike on veCRV or veBAL, where projects allocate liquidity to a whole pool, here, with Maverick, &lt;strong&gt;protocols will be able to target their voting power to a specific part of the AMM distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more information on veMAV here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/introducing-maverick-protocols-voting-escrow-model-c29a60120339&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introducing Maverick Protocol&amp;rsquo;s Voting-Escrow Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maverick--vemav-x-chain-strategy&#34;&gt;Maverick &amp;amp; veMAV X-chain strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical thing to note with the MAV token is that it implements &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/layerzero-omnichain-contracts/oft&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Layer Zero&amp;rsquo;s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard&lt;/a&gt;, greatly facilitating cross-chain operations. It enables MAV to exist natively on every chain and should ease the operational overhard for the team to launch the gauge system on a new network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem much at first glance, but it could make a massive difference. Indeed, Curve and Balancer have been slow to export their full gauge model to networks other than the mainnet they initially operate on. &lt;strong&gt;I expect Maverick to move much more quickly&lt;/strong&gt;, and the early empirical data validate it. In ~3 months of existence, Maverick has already launched two chains apart from mainnet: zkSync and BSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;another-main-difference-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Another main difference with veCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;veMAV implements several other changes compared to a base veCRV model, and I invite you to identify them all. Here are some other ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The veMAV per MAV weighting is not linear here, even if it still favors max lockers (4 years); the min lock of 1 week gives one veMAV/MAV, while max locking gives 5veMAV/MAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no linear decay&lt;/strong&gt; like on veCRV - which is a significant UX improvement. It could also have very positive consequences for veMAV liquid wrappers, making it easier to keep close to the peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet there are still incentives to stay committed. Indeed, The veMAV/MAV ratio is computed with the formula &lt;code&gt;1.5^(lock end - contract launch)&lt;/code&gt;. With the lock end as the main parameter, veMAV lockers who want to maximize their power must extend their lock frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding wrappers, several existing projects have already expressed their intention of building on top of Maverick or veMAV, including Paladin, SpiralDAO, and StakeDAO. The MAV wars will be vicious, so read the fine print before locking your MAV somewhere else than in the veMAV contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forward-outlook--parting-words&#34;&gt;Forward outlook &amp;amp; parting words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick is currently live on mainnet, zkSync, and BSC. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to remark on how much it dominates the volume on zkSync, even with a fraction of its competitor TVL:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/zksync-dex-tvl.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;zksync-dex-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mainnet, most of the success has been found with ETH-LSDs pairs (wstETH, swETH, etc.) and stablecoins. Maverick&amp;rsquo;s efficient liquidity structure is highly competitive with Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On volatile tokens, LPs are a bit shy still, just like it took a few months for people to get used to the novelty brought in by Uniswap V3. Interestingly, LPs are experimenting more on zkSync, especially on pairs such as ETH/USDC, thanks to the lowered gas costs, leading to an overall capital efficiency even more significant than on mainnet, here are the stats for today (July 06 2023):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap V3 - mainnet: 0.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - mainnet: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - zkSync: 0.93&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started-with-maverick-as-a-user&#34;&gt;Getting started with Maverick as a user
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a learning curve for Maverick, as understanding how to structure liquidity properly can be intimidating because of all the options provided. Yet more options mean more expressivity and, thus, more efficiency and returns when adequately harnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make the most of Maverick as a user and discover the protocol in an environment with low fees, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend supplying your first LPs on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt; - as it will enable you to modify them at a low cost if needed. Like most new DeFi products, the best way to master it is to use it and see it behaves in various market conditions, so get at it: you might also be double-dipping on airdrops so that it can be quite a rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to check out the Boosted Pools, which - in addition to their incentives - have a pre-defined liquidity configuration, making them more accessible to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-managers-its-time-to-wake-up&#34;&gt;Liquidity Managers, it&amp;rsquo;s time to wake up!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the project side, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute necessity for liquidity managers to understand and master Maverick&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s by far the venue delivering the most liquidity efficiency. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them in the process, since it has become a specialty of mine. Feel free to reach out if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss how your project could harness liquidity shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the next few months of the DEX wars will unfold; with Maverick already consistently in the top 5 of Ethereum DEXes by volume processed, I think it&amp;rsquo;s no stretch to envision it breaking into the top 3 by the end of year latest as the veMAV gauges will be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand the paradigm shift that lies with the transition from liquidity mining / basic ve(3,3) to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse implementing vote-directed liquidity shaping. Feel free to follow the events live, monitoring onchain data like as OGs do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solidly/Velodrome forks have been popping up like mushrooms, especially across the popular layer 2 like Arbitrum or zkSync. Solidly is now the top #3 forked protocol in DeFi and one of the rare cases where the forks (such as Velodrome) are the market leaders. At first glance, it could seem like just another fork hype train, like when we had the Uni/Sushi fork season, Olympus fork season, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, it’s overblown: an absurd amount of such DEXes are launching weekly, and 95% of them won’t be relevant six months from now. However, like with most of such hype trains, there is deep down, below the fluff, an actual fundamental innovation in how decentralized exchanges are designed that is worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article will dive deep into the Solidly and Velodrome models to understand why they became a standard fork template. With that said, we’ll be in an excellent position to ponder the next steps for these DEXes and what this market might look like in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get right to it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV Wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-ve33-dexes&#34;&gt;Introduction to ve(3,3) DEXes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how Solidly built on top and tried to improve the veCRV model, let’s take a step back to consider the scope first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amm-structure-vs-incentivization-layer&#34;&gt;AMM Structure VS Incentivization Layer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to grasp the ve(3,3) DEXes story, we need to distinguish between two layers that are equally important for a decentralized exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure layer&lt;/strong&gt;: the various AMM models used to sustain liquidity, such as UNIv2’s x*y=k or Curve’s stableswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;: fees + all other incentives directed to the liquidity provider, including token emissions (such as in the CRV model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the end of the day, 1 – the liquidity structure – is the heart of the game, the second layer – incentives – is crucial in attracting and sustaining sufficient liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve innovated on both. While the models we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss today harnessed it, they &lt;strong&gt;focus entirely on improving the incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed at the current stage, most of ve(3,3) DEXes harnessing the Solidly or Velodrome model only offer two well-known liquidity structure types: x*y=k &amp;amp; stableswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the DEXes, those two liquidity models are called correlated/volatile or stable/volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about what was so interesting about Andre’s Cronje original Solidly and what insights we can draw from its failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;andre-cronjes-solidly-innovations&#34;&gt;Andre Cronje’s Solidly Innovations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in early 2022 on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cronje’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, the crucial part of Solidly’s vision was a significant improvement in the utility for lockers. On Curve, lockers are committed for four years with non-transferable vote-escrowed tokens. While it’s great for the long-term incentives alignment of all the participants of the Curve ecosystem, it also creates a sizable barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus came ve(3,3), with at its core &lt;strong&gt;the veNFT&lt;/strong&gt;. While veCRV are illiquid, veSOLID positions are represented by the veNFT, enabling their transfer or OTC sale/purchase. It helps make locking less scary. To further incentivize it, Cronje introduced “&lt;strong&gt;anti-dilutive rebases&lt;/strong&gt;”, a concept drawn from Ampleforth/Olympus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is simple: since the Curve/Solidly DEX model emits tokens weekly to liquidity providers, vetokens holders are constantly diluted. They must keep increasing their position even to maintain their current vote share. To compensate for this, veSOLID holders receive a weekly rebase proportional to the weekly emissions under the Solidly model. This allows them to maintain their voting share even if no new tokens are locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these changes, Solidly inherited most of the Curve model, including &lt;strong&gt;the LP boost&lt;/strong&gt; feature, enabling vetokens holders to earn boosted yields on their liquidity position. This feature has real consequences since it pretty much “calls for a Convex.” Indeed, the logical conclusion of such a feature is one/a few actors seizing significant amounts of vetokens and providing their LP boost to depositors for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence/absence of this feature is the critical difference between the Solidly and Velodrome models, so we’ll touch back on it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there one last critical twist to the voter incentives model. On Curve, LP get half of the trading fees collected + CRV emissions, while voters have no exposure to the fees of the pool they are voting on. It can lead to situation where voters are voting for pools just for the bribes, even if the pool provides no volume to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Solidly, the LPs are only rewarded with SOLID emission, and the LP fees are redirected to the voters of the pool. Thus, as a veSOLID holder, to optimize your earnings, you are incentivized to consider the volume on the pool you are voting on, and not just the bribes. This leads to a better alignment of the incentives of the main participants of the protocol (swapper, liquidity provider, veHolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly also innovated on the launch strategy, with &lt;strong&gt;an airdrop targeted at protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their onchain activity on Fantom, where Solidly was. Together, all those innovations and the hype led to a massive amount of liquidity quickly attracted to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Solidly’s initial implementation had a few key weaknesses, including an aggressively steep decline in emissions and fully permissionless gauge creation that allowed any pools to receive SOLID rewards. It was gamable, so it was gamed. Soon, tokens were created for the sole purpose of farming SOLID, and the price quickly spiraled, along with the TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/solidly-tvl.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cover-image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TVL disappeared as quickly as it came, and Solidly became a part of history for most. But those who followed the events closely knew that Solidly’s failure did not come from a weakness in the ve(3,3) model but more of &lt;strong&gt;an overlooked detail of its implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that while Solidly was no more, ve(3,3) would likely resurface. And it did, a few months later, on another chain made by another team: enter Velodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;velodromes-refinements-to-the-solidly-model&#34;&gt;Velodrome’s refinements to the Solidly model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; harnessed the Solidly model and fixed the issue with emissions by implementing a &lt;strong&gt;whitelist for gauges&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to avoid the situation where rewards are allocated to made-up tokens, as seen on Solidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome went far beyond a mere fork, though, and implemented further improvements; among them were a more sustainable emissions model and &lt;strong&gt;removing the LP boost feature&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning there is no preferential treatment for veVELO holders in terms of yield. Velodrome also streamlines the experience for first-time LPs who might be confused with the yield range you see on DEXes with LP boost implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical features, a large part of Velodrome’s success is due to the &lt;strong&gt;team’s execution and care for the business development strategies&lt;/strong&gt;, an essential part of the ve(3,3) model. Built on Optimism, Velodrome found its PMF as the chain liquidity layer. Thanks to its model, sustaining liquidity on Velodrome is much more cost-effective for projects than, say, on Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Solidly, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome airdropped several protocols with a veVELO NFT,&lt;/strong&gt; no strings attached, which helped immensely to attract the initial voting and bribing activity. The protocol found a good fit, mostly with other protocols emitting stablecoins or ETH liquid stake derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/defiwars-velodrome.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defiwars-velodrome&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost a year, and the activity has sustained, thanks to careful and progressive adjustments of the &lt;strong&gt;OP incentives allocated on the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/tour-de-op-updates-631268181baa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tour de OP&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are used to incentivize two behaviors essential to sustain the flywheel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes from protocols, incentivized by OP bribes matching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking of veVELO, incentivized by an OP lock bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribe matching is further increased for projects which lock veVELO or deploy sizeable amounts of protocol-owned liquidity to the exchange, helping further amplify the reinforcing effect: those who want to build liquidity sustained over the long term on Velodrome have been given solid reasons to buy VELO, lock and vote, bribe, and supply POL, &lt;strong&gt;ideally all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to Velodrome topping the protocols TVL charts on Optimism and processing about 30% of the total volume of the chain vs 50% for Uniswap, which has roughly ¼ of Velodrome’s TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/optimism-volume.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;optimism-DEX-volume&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why such a spread between the both? Simple: Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s Volume/TVL ratio is ~9x above Velodrome right now because the liquidity on Uniswap is much more concentrated and thus more efficient. But it’s about to change as Velodrome V2 is arriving soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-velodrome-v2&#34;&gt;Introducing Velodrome V2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap had a headstart with concentrated liquidity, it will change rapidly. The v3 license &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/governance/liscense-modifications&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;expired on April 1st 2023&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the model is now much easier to re-implement. Many DEXes, including Solidly/Velodrome forks, intend to harness this. Still, to keep this article focused, we’ll only cover what is announced for Velodrome V2, expected in the next few weeks/months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Velodrome V2 will not just mark &lt;strong&gt;the introduction of UNI-v3 style of LP on the DEX&lt;/strong&gt; but also significant UX/UI improvements, a relayer to ease the management of veNFT, artwork for the veNFT, and much more. Check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-road-ah-43488531bb0e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;V2 announcement article&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you understand the benefits of the Solidly and Velodrome models. While I mention the myriad of forks in the introduction, I’ve stayed on course with this article. I guess this calls for a follow-up where I comb through their main forks and the modifications they implement into the template: stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Business Development&lt;/strong&gt; | ve(3,3), just like Curve, are protocols for protocols. The team&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and ability to efficiently prioritize and executive on BD is a sizable success factor of the DEX over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the launch/airdrop/top racers rooster&lt;/strong&gt; | Even if BD is done well, a given ve(3,3) DEX is only as good as its top racers. Yes, you want them bribing, voting, and driving awareness, but not only. The quality of the liquidity driven to the DEX also matters (volume/TVL ratio).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LP Boost and its consequences&lt;/strong&gt; | If a ve(3,3) implements LP boost, it calls for Convex-like protocols. The success of the ve(3,3) will be impacted by how much and how well its Convex-likes do. To follow the key stats on the various wrappers and main veTokens holders, check - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiWars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ve(3,3) + Liquidity Concentration&lt;/strong&gt; | While ve(3,3) is a significant innovation for the incentives layer of the DEX, it currently harnesses sub-par liquidity structures. Properly matching the ve(3,3) incentives model with an efficient UNIv3-style liquidity structure will help further improve the effectiveness of the flywheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-x-tokenbrice/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-x-tokenbrice/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/maverick-x-tokenbrice-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is more of a personal announcement: I wanted to let you know what I am up to and what&amp;rsquo;s happening with Maverick. So let&amp;rsquo;s not beat around the bush: I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce that &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m supporting the Maverick team as an advisor, helping with the growth strategy, tokenomics, and business development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;storytime&#34;&gt;Storytime
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like me, you must be over-saturated with DEXes. If you follow DeFi closely, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen several of these launches daily. Yet most still adopt fundamental liquidity structures: x*y=k for volatile pairs and stableswap, and focus on innovating on the tokenomics instead: the now famous ve(3,3) DEXes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a DEX that would innovate at the fundamental level&lt;/strong&gt; for a while, so in May last year, when Bob reached out to let me know about Maverick, I was all ears. I quickly realized Maverick could reshape how we envision liquidity in DeFi and help further improve its efficiency. So I’m glad to announce my involvement today: Maverick is already live, growing quickly, and poised for even exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we dive into what makes Maverick so interesting, we need to take a step back and consider the broader context of liquidity in DeFi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-structuring-deep-dive&#34;&gt;Liquidity Structuring Deep Dive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning, there was Uniswap&lt;/strong&gt;, and its ease of use for liquidity providers led people to believe it was a trivial activity. Yet, any liquidity-providing activity on a DEX involves two decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking a pair (or more) of tokens (ex: ETH/USDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;Forming price assumptions regarding one/both tokens (🐂, 🐻, or 🦀)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second decision is &lt;strong&gt;often implicit&lt;/strong&gt;, like with UniswapV2, where you get no option but only one choice: 50/50, meaning that your optimal scenario is both tokens going sideways in price with a large trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Uniswap V3 emerged, the second assumption was suddenly more explicit to DeFi users thanks to concentrated liquidity. However, V3 added complexity to the liquidity provider experience and active management. It &lt;strong&gt;mainly caters to power-users who can afford frequent rebalancing&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;require external tooling&lt;/strong&gt; to be harnessed effectively by LPs, the liquidity manager – Arrakis, Bunni, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-unique-about-maverick&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s unique about Maverick?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Maverick is the spiritual descendant of UniV3 and CurveV2. It offers infinite flexibility in the design of liquidity-providing position, similar to Uniswap V3, but with streamlined and autonomous execution, just like on Curve. Indeed, LPs on Maverick can decide to redistribute their liquidity to follow the price in one or both directions. &lt;strong&gt;If needed, the rebalancing is done at the DEX level, ensuring gas efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt; Maverick also supports “static pools” that are range-bound too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This feature makes Maverick a fantastic fit for pegged assets, especially those that are not continually trading precisely at the peg&lt;/strong&gt; and so underserved by the usual liquidity structures, such as a LUSD/USDC pair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve stableswap, which optimizes liquidity for a 1/1 price, is not ideal when LUSD is overpeg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap v3, where LPs usually end up super concentrated around the current market price, which is efficient, but also quickly through them out of range as the price move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-mode-both&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Maverick, such a pair can be harnessed optimally by each LP, depending on their actual goal. &lt;strong&gt;It enables each LP to craft an automatically adjusting position that enforces a strategy fitting his assumptions and needs&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are some examples of goals &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; liquidity structure matching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🎚️ | Looking for a safe yield with minimal risk? A static LP might be preferable, as the outcomes are predictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🐂/🐻 | Thinking LUSD is currently over/undervalued: you can supply directional liquidity and earn extra if your assumption verifies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🦀 | Want to bet on volume with prices going sideways? You can simply focus your liquidity a few bins around the price and activate the &lt;strong&gt;left-right mode&lt;/strong&gt; to constantly rebalance the current price, thus maximizing the available liquidity and fees collected but also the potential impermanent loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Maverick has found &lt;strong&gt;a beast of a product/market fit on pools like wstETH/ETH&lt;/strong&gt;, often averaging over 100% daily utilization rate. Here’s today, for instance (4/20):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve: TVL = $1.5B, Volume =$34M, Utilization = 2,26%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick: TVL = $10.6M, Volume =$10.45M, &lt;strong&gt;Utilization = 98,5%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/maverickxtokenbrice/mav-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Maverick Top Pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched just a few weeks ago on the Ethereum mainnet, Maverick is already seeing an impressive volume and unprecedented liquidity utilization rate, especially on pegged asset pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick was also launched on zkSync, its first L2, a few days ago. As more staple DeFi projects roll out service there, Maverick will have many opportunities to demonstrate the superior efficiency its liquidity designs can offer to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about the next steps: as a DeFi Strategist at Liquity, the release of Maverick felt like early Christmas to me; I think it&amp;rsquo;s just getting started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll contribute to Maverick as an advisor, meaning that my main focus remains my commitment to immutable protocols, especially Liquity, helping them grow through various onchain and offchain activities. I’m confident Maverick will quickly prove to be a decisive tool in achieving that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just hearing about Maverick? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mav.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Liquity-driver token races beyond Curve: a look at the Balancer Wars</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/balancer-wars/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/balancer-wars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/balancer-wars-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Liquity-driver token races beyond Curve: a look at the Balancer Wars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity-driver tokens, as I call them, are an emergent and fascinating construction. Simply put, these tokens enable you to direct incentives (CRV, BAL, etc.) to the liquidity pool of your choice. To do so, you must usually own and lock the corresponding token (veCRV, veBAL, etc.) within their governance contract, ensuring continuous commitment from participating projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the liquidity-driver tokens quickly became highly sought after by DAOs with constant and usually growing liquidity needs. It led to what we call “races” (or &amp;ldquo;wars&amp;rdquo;): a term that refers to the various strategies projects harness to constantly increase their veTokens stash, ideally faster than the other participants of the races, to grow a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve covered the CRV tokenomics, the pioneer of the veToken model, and their consequences in this blog extensively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

/content/posts/2022/crv-wars-l2.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vetokenomics-beyond-the-curve-ecosystem&#34;&gt;veTokenomics, beyond the Curve ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Curve is fascinating to study, as it’s the veCRV pioneer and still the most mature and dense implementation of ve tokenomics to date, there are now many other race instances with their twists worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the veCRV tokenomics is more than two years old, and many other projects have launched or revamped their tokenomics since, drawing inspiration from Curve’s model. Without being exhaustive, here are the other “races” I follow the most closely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solidly pioneered the “ve(3,3)” model (attempting to build and improve on the base ve model) on Fantom in February 2022, quickly attracting billions of TVL before &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackmd.io/@c30/BJ2PNCwgs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;failing dramatically because of very poor execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.velodrome.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;, a fork of Solidly fixing its critical issues, quickly found its place on Optimism after launching in June 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://balancer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer&lt;/a&gt; — a historical alternative to Curve and Uniswap, a chain agnostic DEX packing interesting innovations, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-is-live-aeda1ae13e20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recently switched to a vemodel in March 2022.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SolidlyETH&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Solidly&lt;/a&gt;, again. Indeed, while the first project failed, the community gathered to take over and is about to re-launch Solidly, this time on mainnet, making it much more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am myself a liquidity-driver addict, as I was sharing recently on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All projects have constant liquidity needs; addressing them sustainably is highly valuable. Indeed, the value of liquidity-driver tokens exceeds what DAOs/projects can draw from them: $1 worth of vote-bribing can move &amp;gt;$1 worth of incentives. Individual participants can also gain a lot by being able to position themselves early in a relevant race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the stage set, let’s dive into today’s matter: Balancer, their BAL races, and the “BAL-Layer-2” infrastructure that emerged on top of it, just like it happened with Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mapping-the-balancer-trinity&#34;&gt;Mapping the Balancer Trinity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/balancer-trinity.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;balancer-trinity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we documented Curve, we watched the ecosystem grow together on this blog. With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://balancer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer&lt;/a&gt;, I’m covering it extensively for the first time and already looking at a mature ecosystem. Balancer already has “its Convex,” called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aura.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aura Finance&lt;/a&gt;. It already controls over 25% of the veBAL (vs &amp;gt;50% of veCRV for Convex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Balancer base infrastructure calls for a third component: an automation network necessary to enable the most advanced type of pools. At this stage, it’s still unclear who is leading this race, so I’ve used one of their most prominent participants – &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://powerpool.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PowerPool&lt;/a&gt; and its PowerAgents network — to play the part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with UniswapV3 liquidity provisioning, one could say PowerAgents play a role similar to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gelato.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gelato&lt;/a&gt;: it handles the automation of operations required to enable specific use cases, such as rewards harvesting and auto-compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-balancer-different&#34;&gt;What makes Balancer different?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Uniswap and Curve, Balancer has been one of the longest-standing DEX with significant traction today. Indeed, looking at the DEX market from a global perspective, Balancer is scoring fifth place with about 3% of the total volume processed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancer&amp;rsquo;s first version launched in March 2020, and many iterations have been shipped since then, improving the BAL token model and liquidity structure. However, Balancer had &lt;strong&gt;specificities since V1&lt;/strong&gt; that are probably key in explaining why it’s still standing today. I’ll focus on the most emblematic, Balancer-specific ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pool-supporting-2-to-8-assets&#34;&gt;Pool supporting 2 to 8 assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancer is still, to this day, one of the only DEX offering such a wide range of pool structures. Indeed, a Balancer pool can be made of &lt;strong&gt;any number ranging from 2 to 8 assets&lt;/strong&gt;, while most other DEX only support pairs, so two assets at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables novel types of pools, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 assets pools, such as the wBTC/USDC/wETH pool similar to Curve’s TriCrypto pool, or to diversify the pairing of a given token, like the OHM/ETH/DAI pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or even 7-8 asset pools that start acting as token indexes as much as liquidity pools, such as the YFI/wBTC/COMP/wETH/UNI/CHZ/LINK pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arbitrary-pool-weighting&#34;&gt;Arbitrary pool weighting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the flexible support in terms of the number of tokens, &lt;strong&gt;pool weighting does not need to be even across tokens&lt;/strong&gt; and can be extensively customized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enables unbalanced pool structures that are very useful in certain situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance, the OHM/DAI/ETH pool mentioned above is &lt;strong&gt;50%OHM, 25%DAI, and 25%wETH&lt;/strong&gt; – enabling the maximization of the OHM liquidity available against both DAI and ETH at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another frequently used distribution is the &lt;strong&gt;98/2&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly fitting to start building the liquidity of a newly released token with minimal IL risk (since 98% of the pool is composed of the safe pairing asset, like a stable or ETH)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;80% Token / 20% pairing asset&lt;/strong&gt; such as 80% BAL / 20% wETH is also a highly sought-after liquidity distribution, as it enables token holders to partake in liquidity providing activities with minimized IL risks if the token was to appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-pool-weighting&#34;&gt;Dynamic pool weighting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Balancer can adjust the pool weighting distribution as needed through a specific type of pool called a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquidity Boostraping Pool (LBP)&lt;/a&gt;. Such pools are particularly fitting for launching tokens &amp;amp; building their liquidity at the same time, as they enable the streamlined go-to-market token flow. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A given project wants to quickstart its token liquidity — the associated DAO controls a significant amount of the token, but usually none of the potential pairing asset (usually ETH or stablecoin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So they start with a 98% USDC / 2% Token pool, enabling them to provide liquidity with minimal pairing token requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pool acts as a token initiation event and price discovery mechanism at the same time. The token starts at a given price, which decreases as time goes on if no one purchases the token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/LBP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;balancer-trinity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBPs are designed to enable users interested in the project to purchase tokens fairly over a given period, protecting them against the usual attacks seen on more classical tokens launches (such as MEV bots sniping initial supply).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables the user-DAO to accumulate the pairing token and first price discovery of the DAO’s token, making it easy to jump to the next step: quickstart the token liquidity with protocol-owned seeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;specificities-of-balancers-vemodel&#34;&gt;Specificities of Balancer’s veModel
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancer also has implemented its twist on their Curve’s inspired locking mechanism. Here, instead of locking the token directly (CRV ⇒ veCRV), governance participants must &lt;strong&gt;lock an LP token&lt;/strong&gt; corresponding to the Balancer &lt;strong&gt;80% BAL / 20% wETH&lt;/strong&gt; pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, this liquidity distribution limits IL risks for depositors on a BAL upside. Thanks to this twist, Balancer can capture significant liquidity reserves through the normal operations of its governance participation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as of late, it seems like Balancer is focusing on interest-bearing tokens and developing new use cases to cater to them. For instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-pt-2-bribing-and-bip19s-free-bribes-b2f8334eba14&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BIP#19&lt;/a&gt; introduces “free bribes” for pools involving interest-bearing assets: the yield produced by the pool asset is recycled as a bribe to sustain its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lay-of-the-land-of-the-balancer-wars&#34;&gt;Lay of the land of the Balancer Wars
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Curve, Balancer has one dominant player of its race which developed a protocol optimized for synergy with Balancer: Aura. Aura is one of many services available in the Balancer-functional-L2 ecosystem, but a vastly dominant one with ~25% of all veBAL under the protocol control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aura offers efficient farming to holders of Balancer LP tokens, with BAL rewards boosted thanks to the protocol&amp;rsquo;s sizeable veBAL stash and additional AURA incentives. In that regard, it is the same thing as Convex to Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocols-with-vebalvlaura-positions&#34;&gt;Protocols with veBAL/vlAURA positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the protocols working on liquid-wrapper for veBAL like Aura, some other DAOs and projects built sizeable veBAL/vlAURA positions to grow and sustain their liquidity, like Frax is doing on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancer-bribe-markets&#34;&gt;Balancer Bribe Markets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bribe markets are enabling the purchase of veBAL or vlAURA votes; here are the main ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hiddenhand.finance/aura&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Hidden Hand – Balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/quest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Paladin’s Warden Balancer Quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://votemarket.stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;And StakeDAO BAL Votemarket&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of bribing marketplace aggregator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow the Balancer wars, make sure to harness the amazing data computed by the Llama Airforce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/balancer-wars/llama-airforce-aura.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;llama-airforce-aura&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on the graph, the bribing markets took off quickly before finding an equilibrium at around &lt;strong&gt;$0.06 per AURA vote, translating into 1.50x bribes efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: $1 spent bribing the vote results in $1.50 worth of BAL emission added to the targeted pool over the epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure is lower on the Curve races, around 1.25x for the Convex vlCVX bribing. It’s logical since Curve races are much older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-balancer&#34;&gt;What’s next for Balancer?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complement the traction achieved thanks to the tokenomics revamp and switch to veBAL, several technical developments have been shipped/are coming to the Balancer DEX and should help further cement its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;boosted-pools&#34;&gt;Boosted Pools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one is the boosted pool, which is already live. They optimize the yields produced by liquidity providers by harnessing additional IL-free yield sources with tokens not needed to stomach the liquidity-providing activity. The bb-a-USD, Balancer’s 3pool equivalent, is the top Boosted Pool currently, but more are coming, including a LUSD-based one: LUCY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/introduction-to-powerpool-lucy-pool-and-what-it-brings-to-lusd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduction to PowerPool&amp;rsquo;s LUCY pool and what it brings to $LUSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aave-x-balancer&#34;&gt;Aave x Balancer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aave and Balancer have historic ties, with Aave Safety Module harnessing Balancer V1, and Aave even shipping a V2 market a few years ago to leverage Balancer LP tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further collaborations are anticipated, as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave acquired BAL tokens recently&lt;/a&gt; and will face dramatically increased liquidity needs with the GHO release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;balancer-home-of-the-lsds&#34;&gt;Balancer: home of the LSDs?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, looking at the current top pool TVL-wise on Balancer, a clear fit is emerging: liquid staked derivatives, such as Rocket Pool’s rETH or Lido’s stETH. Both have sizeable pools properly incentivized on Balancer mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lido’s wstETH/wETH pool even flipped the 80BAL/20wETH pool and became the top one of the DEX with $200M TVL. Similarly, stMATIC/wMATIC is the top Balancer/Polygon pool, followed by MATICX/wMATIC, featuring another liquid MATIC staking derivative. On Arbitrum, the third and last chain where Balancer is live, here again, the wstETH/wETH pool tops the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I hope this article provided you with actionable insights regarding liquidity-driver tokens, I wanted to add another layer: it seems like a &lt;strong&gt;subcategory&lt;/strong&gt; of liquidity-driver is emerging – &lt;strong&gt;the lending liquidity-driver token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work very similarly, but instead of enabling their holders to direct incentives to liquidity pools, they allow them to &lt;strong&gt;direct incentives to select lending markets&lt;/strong&gt;. So, in the end, they accomplish a different goal through a similar mean: controlling a lot of these lending-liquidity-driver tokens, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://euler.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Euler Finance’s&lt;/a&gt; EUL, allows for sustaining deep liquidity in lending markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably worth looking at; I’ve been anticipating the arrival of ve and ve(3,3) based tokenomics to money markets for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chicken Bonds: an NFT-powered hatching factory to beat DeFi’s liquidity chicken and egg problem</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/lusd-chicken-bonds/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/lusd-chicken-bonds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/lusd-chicken-bonds-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post Chicken Bonds: an NFT-powered hatching factory to beat DeFi’s liquidity chicken and egg problem" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity recently released the LUSD Chicken Bonds, a &lt;strong&gt;game-theory experiment merging DeFi and NFT elements to grow LUSD’s liquidity and reduce its price premium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Chicken Bonds are building on top of existing protocols, such as Yearn, b.protocol, or Curve, it also instigates novel mechanisms, the two leading ones being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No maturity principal-protected bonding&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicken Bonds use a new type of bonding offering strong guarantees to the depositor, including the possibility to recoup the entire initially supplied capital at no cost (Chicken Out).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate to Earn dynamic NFT&lt;/strong&gt;: While interacting with the LUSD Chicken Bonds protocol, users obtain a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic NFT&lt;/strong&gt; that evolves depending on their choices and previous onchain interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds tackle one of the core challenges of DeFi, the sustainable growth of liquidity pools, first for the LUSD token only. Still, eventually, the model will be made available in a generalizable permissionless version for any protocol in need of liquidity to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explores how &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chickenbonds.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LUSD Chicken Bonds&lt;/a&gt; work and what they achieve. However, before answering these questions, additional context is needed on LUSD: let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context-lusd-price-premium&#34;&gt;The context: LUSD price premium
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most misunderstood dimensions of Liquity’s model is &lt;strong&gt;LUSD pegging mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, while LUSD has strong guarantees (hard peg) than LUSD&amp;gt;$1.00 (redemption) and &amp;lt;$1.10 (110% minimal collateralization ratio), in between the equilibrium is more based on a &lt;strong&gt;game of incentives (soft peg)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/tornado-cash-sanctions-challenges/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OFAC’s crackdown on Tornado Cash&lt;/a&gt; back in August, there has been an &lt;strong&gt;increased demand&lt;/strong&gt; for censorship-resistant stablecoins. Yet, the &lt;strong&gt;appetite for leverage is low&lt;/strong&gt; because of the deteriorated market conditions. Thus, will the demand for LUSD is high, a significant share of its adopters purchase it at a premium on the markets instead of minting it by leveraging their ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both factors have converged over the last few months, leading to a &lt;strong&gt;sustained price premium&lt;/strong&gt; for LUSD, often trading in the $1.02 to $1.04 range. I won’t expand too deeply into this topic here, as it has already been covered on Liquity’s blog: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Premium of Resiliency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, let’s discuss &lt;strong&gt;the impact of the premium on Liquity users&lt;/strong&gt; since it has real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-the-lusd-premium&#34;&gt;Impact of the LUSD premium
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of a price premium on borrowers &lt;strong&gt;can be positive or negative&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their timing and actions. Borrowers worried about LUSD price volatility can use Chicken Bonds, or b.protocol to preserve a pure LUSD exposure while earning yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that borrowers who preserve a 100% LUSD exposure do not suffer any consequence from its price fluctuations since they do not need to buy it back when repaying their debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having LUSD fluctuates can also benefit informed users that can arbitrage the discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit margin&lt;/strong&gt; | The more LUSD goes over $1, the more profitable it is to take an arbitrage trade on its peg: at $1.01, shorting the peg returns $0.01 per LUSD if successful. At $1.09, the profits jump to $0.09 per LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Likelihood of profits being realized&lt;/strong&gt; | The farther away LUSD strands from $1.00, and the closer it gets to $1.10, the more likely it is for peg arbitrageurs to outweigh LUSD buyers and thus push the price downward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus arbitraging LUSD is a game of balance between maximizing profits (1) and their odds of realizing (2). To put it simply: past a certain price point, the arbitrage trade becomes &lt;strong&gt;too profitable and too likely to realize for arbitrageurs to ignore&lt;/strong&gt;. It has helped to ensure that LUSD stayed in the lower bond of its soft peg, the $1.00-$1.05 range, even during phases of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users who do not monitor the situation continuously, though, it can translate into a loss of capital — for instance, if one borrows LUSD while the price is at $1.02, invest it into something else, and then weeks later try to buy back LUSD to repay its debt, only to find the price at $1.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, LUSD’s fluctuations in the $1.00-1.10 range add &lt;strong&gt;an additional layer of uncertainty for borrowers&lt;/strong&gt;. Growing the liquidity of LUSD and stabilizing its peg will help restore the borrowers’ confidence and streamline interactions with the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve LUSD’s liquidity challenge, the Liquity team worked on a &lt;strong&gt;brand new protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, first tried out with LUSD: Chicken Bonds. If successful, the model will be generalized with an LQTY instance. As a final step, the generalized model could be made ready to be harnessed by any DAO with the Chicken Bond Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.chickenbonds.org/blog-posts/chicken-bonds-is-live&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the LUSD Chicken Bonds were released&lt;/a&gt;, offering &lt;strong&gt;a novel proposition merging DeFi and NFTs&amp;rsquo; elements providing optimized yield-producing opportunities to LUSD holders&lt;/strong&gt;. It will also fuel the growth of LUSD’s liquidity on the LUSD/3CRV Curve pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two protagonists interacting with Chicken Bonds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The depositors (users)&lt;/strong&gt; enjoy a gamified experience delivering &lt;strong&gt;amplified and auto-compounded yields on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deployer (protocol)&lt;/strong&gt; sets up an &lt;strong&gt;engine enabling the sustained growth and capture of liquidity on its token&lt;/strong&gt; while actively engaging its holders.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-exactly-are-chicken-bonds&#34;&gt;So, what exactly are Chicken Bonds?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Chicken Bonds fulfill the function of different types of products depending on the perspective. &lt;strong&gt;For users, Chicken Bonds act like an NFT-enhanced yield optimizer&lt;/strong&gt;. Bonding enables them to maximize their returns on LUSD by optimizing the compounding frequency and amplifying the existing yields. From their perspective, they could compare the utility of Chicken Bonds to the one already delivered by a protocol like Yearn, lacking the NFT element. It maximizes and streamlines yield-producing activities on LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the deployer (protocol) perspective, Chicken Bonds are a &lt;strong&gt;cost-effective solution to develop the available liquidity on their token&lt;/strong&gt;. Alternative solutions to achieve a similar goal would include liquidity mining, POL-capture solution like Olympus Pro, acquiring liquidity-driver tokens (CRV, BAL, VELO, etc.)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or bribing liquidity-driver token owner votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/chicken-egg.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;chicken-egg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While each existing solution has its own tradeoffs, they all share a similar profile: they &lt;strong&gt;require recurring expenses to grow and sustain liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;. Only the acquisition of liquidity-driver tokens can provide continuous incentives to support liquidity, but it’s also the most costly approach as it requires significant investments from projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Chicken Bonds have no cost as they harness existing yield sources: &lt;strong&gt;all it needs to capture and grow liquidity is time&lt;/strong&gt;. They harness a novel form of &lt;strong&gt;no-maturity principal-protected bonding&lt;/strong&gt;, offering amplified yields and strong protections for the depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain the model of LUSD Chicken Bonds, let’s jump to the depositor perspective by looking at the lifecycle of a bond and its impact on the associated NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story-of-a-bond-through-its-nft&#34;&gt;The story of a bond through its NFT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/3chickens-static.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3chickens&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create a bond, a user deposits LUSD. In exchange, he receives an 🥚 Egg NFT representing his deposit&lt;/strong&gt;. The NFT contains the claim on the underlying bonded LUSD and can be sold or transferred. From thereon, the user has two mutually exclusive options that will transform his NFT too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🐔 Chicken In&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or 🐣 Chicken Out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egg NFTs have four attributes: a card, egg, and background colors rolled randomly, and an egg-size scaling with the deposited LUSD amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an egg is created, it starts progressively accruing bLUSD. As the bond matures, it becomes profitable for the users to claim it, forgoing their LUSD to obtain the bLUSD accumulated — It’s the “&lt;strong&gt;Chicken In&lt;/strong&gt;” option and makes the visual of the NFT evolve accordingly: the Egg turns into a 🐔 &lt;strong&gt;Proud Chicken&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user can recover the full invested amount at any time during the process. Still, he will renounce the bLUSD accumulated so far — it’s the “&lt;strong&gt;Chicken Out&lt;/strong&gt;” option and also leads to an evolution of the NFT from the Egg to a 🐣 &lt;strong&gt;Scared Chick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;going-deeper-into-the-chicken-bonds-nft&#34;&gt;Going deeper into the Chicken Bonds NFT
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chickening In, the NFT gains additional attributes rolled at random (comb, tail, beak, and wings) and special attributes depending on the wallet onchain activities. Wallets engaged in the following activities are eligible for special attributes or boosted chances at rolling rarer ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a Liquity Trove with ongoing debt,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning LQTY, or staking it either directly or with Pickle,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting for the LUSD/3CRV gauge (veCRV holders).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT collection also harnesses interesting mechanisms, such as the &lt;strong&gt;affinity&lt;/strong&gt; to generate the coolest chickens possible; read the dedicated article on Liquity’s blog for more information on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;NFT x DeFi: Deep dive into LUSD Chicken Bonds&amp;rsquo; Dynamic NFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;boostedlusd-blusd-a-yield-enhanced-auto-compounded-lusd&#34;&gt;boostedLUSD (bLUSD): a yield-enhanced auto-compounded LUSD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bonding and eventually Chickening In, depositors can accumulate bLUSD, but you might wonder at this point why this token can be desirable: let’s dive into the beefy DeFi side of Chicken Bonds!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is that &lt;strong&gt;owning bLUSD provides access to auto-compounded and amplified yields on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. bLUSD is a standard ERC-20 token backed by LUSD thanks to the redemption mechanism, with a rising price floor thanks to the yield amplification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;base-yield-source&#34;&gt;Base yield source
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a protocol, Chicken Bonds collect LUSD and deploy them into two potential yield sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquity Stability Pool&lt;/strong&gt;, where LUSD can be deposited to earn LQTY as well as variable ETH liquidation premiums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curve LUSD/3CRV&lt;/strong&gt;, where LUSD can be supplied against USDC/USDT/DAI to earn trading fees as well as CRV tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with how Liquity works yet, you can get up to date with this dedicated article: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;auto-compounded&#34;&gt;Auto compounded
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of plugging into the yield sources directly, middleware solutions are used to provide various benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposits into the Liquity Stability Pool are managed using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;B.Protocol vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which handles the frequent harvesting and compounding of ETH and LQTY obtained into LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Curve Pool, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x5fA5B62c8AF877CB37031e0a3B2f34A78e3C56A6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is used to optimize the yields obtained by harnessing Convex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good: streamlined solutions to simple problems. Yet, the yield amplification, one of the biggest feats of the Chicken Bonds, is a bit trickier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;yield-amplification&#34;&gt;Yield Amplification
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how it can achieve this, we must start peeling the onion that is the internal accounting tool of the protocol: the Buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three buckets enabling the Chicken bonds to guarantee the three core features of the protocol: the option to Chicken Out (Pending), the yield amplification (Reserve), and the growth of liquidity (Permanent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/3buckets.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3buckets&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pending Bucket&lt;/strong&gt; has a simple job: it must be able to repay investors fully if they were to Chicken Out. To ensure it’s always possible, the Pending Bucket harnesses a yield source free of impermanent loss: the Stability Pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users Chicken In a bond, the corresponding LUSD balances are split between the Reserve and Permanent Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reserve Bucket backs bLUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. With redemptions, bLUSD holders can burn their tokens to obtain a pro-rata share of the LUSD contained in the Reserve Bucket —  securing a price floor for bLUSD. Funds in reserve are also producing a yield harnessing the Stability Pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the Permanent Bucket grows the liquidity of LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to its shifting function, triggerable by anyone when LUSD is overpeg, the Permanent Bucket can pull its liquidity out of the b.protocol vault to single supply the Curve LUSD/3CRV pool instead. It helps reduce the LUSD price and secures a favorable entry point in the pool since the deposit rebalances it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;yield produced by the Pending and Permanent buckets is redirected to the Reserve Bucket&lt;/strong&gt;, which creates the yield amplification and rising price floor of bLUSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bootstrap-period--next-steps&#34;&gt;Bootstrap period &amp;amp; next steps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD Chicken Bonds have been live since Tuesday, October 4, 2022. During the first two weeks of the system, until Oct 19, it’s still in the &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap period&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicken Ins are not possible, which means the supply of bLUSD is still 0. It means that all the LUSD are in the Pending Bucket, except the yield already produced that is being redirected to the Reserve Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the bootstrap period is over, the Chicken In option will be available, enabling depositors to start accessing bLUSD. To facilitate getting in and out of bLUSD, a &lt;strong&gt;bLUSD liquidity pool will be incentivized on Curve Finance, using a 3% fee paid while Chickening In&lt;/strong&gt;. It will enable the liquidity to develop progressively as the first batch of bonds reaches their break-even point (~Oct 19) and optimal rebond time (~Nov 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section will discuss the chosen liquidity structure and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chicken-bonds-impact-on-lusds-price-and-liquidity&#34;&gt;Chicken Bonds’ impact on LUSD’s price and liquidity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read me up to this point, you are now in the know regarding LUSD’s price premium and the model introduced by the Chicken Bonds. Let’s connect the dots then and consider how the LUSD Chicken Bonds will &lt;strong&gt;contribute to LUSD’s overall liquidity and help to contain its premium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds have two impacts on LUSD liquidity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the growth of the Permanent Bucket, the liquidity supplied to the LUSD/3CRV will grow as long as the LUSD price still has a premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The liquidity pool structure was chosen for bLUSD to help further grow liquidity on the LUSD/3CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short time frame, the release of LUSD Chicken Bonds lead to more demand for LUSD and an increase in its price. However, LUSD deposited into the Chicken Bonds proves beneficial to LUSD’s liquidity in the long run, as we highlight in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-engine-to-capture-liquity-over-time&#34;&gt;An engine to capture liquity over time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As deposits into the LUSD Chicken Bonds accrue, the potential impact on the LUSD peg grows. Indeed, when a user Chickens In, the underlying LUSD are distributed between the Reserve and the Permanent Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all three buckets produce yield by deploying the LUSD into the b.protocol vault. However, the Permanent Bucket also features a &lt;strong&gt;shifting function&lt;/strong&gt; triggerable by anyone as long as LUSD trades at a premium. It shifts the LUSD of the Permanent Bucket to &lt;strong&gt;provide liquidity on Curve&lt;/strong&gt; (single asset supply), helping to progressively rebalance the pool while also growing its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of the total amount of LUSD deposited into Chicken Bonds allocated to the Permanent Bucket is hard to predict, as it depends on users&amp;rsquo; behaviors. Here are some napkin maths using a conservative estimate of 10% of the total assets in the Permanent Bucket, with the 5M LUSD currently available in the LUSD/3CRV to estimate the Chicken Bonds impact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Chicken Bonds TVL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Directly Added Liquity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Added Liquity (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7M (Current)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;700K LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;10M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;40.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;50M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;5M LUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;100.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added liquidity percentage could be a good proxy indicator of how much of the price premium can be reduced. Keep in mind that it remains approximative, as it only considers the LUSD/3CRV main pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, with $10M TVL into the Chicken Bonds by the end of the first cycle, the impact could already be palpable with an increase of ~20% of the LUSD amount available in the Curve pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifting function is disabled for the first 45 days of the system, i.e. until November 19. After this date, anyone will be able to move the Permanent Bucket liquidity from Curve &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; B.Protocol if &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://liquity.gitbook.io/chicken-bonds/faq/lusd-peg-stability#_vowf7444yzdt&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growing-blusd-liquidity-hands-in-hand-with-lusd&#34;&gt;Growing bLUSD liquidity hands in hand with LUSD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another indirect beneficial effect of the Chicken Bonds, stemming from the chosen structure for bLUSD liquidity, incentivized by the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a &lt;strong&gt;3% Chicken In fee is collected and redirected to incentivize liquidity providers of the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool&lt;/strong&gt;. This pool is a meta pool made of bLUSD paired with the LP token of the existing LUSD/3CRV. At perfect equilibrium, the asset exposure would be: 50% bLUSD / 25% LUSD + 25% 3pool (8.33% USDC / 8.33% USDT / 8.33% DAI).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This liquidity structure ensures that &lt;strong&gt;50% of the deposits made into the bLUSD LP pool directly contribute to growing the liquidity of the main LUSD/3CRV&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, because this pool has its own incentive budget (Chicken In fee), it will provide an attractive LUSD yield to stakers on top of the base yield generated by swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Chicken Bonds mature, the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool could get its own gauge, securing additional CRV (and potentially CVX) rewards on top of the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model was chosen over a bLUSD/LUSD pool which would have required a sizeable amount of LUSD without contributing to LUSD’s liquidity against other stablecoins. The main downside of the chosen model is that it makes the deposit and withdrawal interactions more complex for liquidity providers. However, this concern will be lifted with &lt;strong&gt;zaps enabling the supply and withdrawal from LUSD and bLUSD directly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV pool equilibrium, supplying it single-sided with either LUSD or bLUSD can result in a premium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is too much LUSD-3CRV in the pool, providing bLUSD rebalances the pool and results in a premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is too much bLUSD in the pool, then supplying it with LUSD will result in a &lt;strong&gt;double premium&lt;/strong&gt; as both the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV and LUSD/3CRV pools are rebalanced in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-solutions-to-grow-lusds-liquidity&#34;&gt;Additional solutions to grow LUSD’s liquidity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken Bonds are the main ongoing initiatives attempting to grow LUSD’s liquidity, yet, other projects and solutions are being explored too. Here’s an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vecrv-position-and-bribes&#34;&gt;veCRV position and bribes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liquity treasury entered the Curve Wars months ago, acquiring and locking CRV tokens to support the bLUSD/LUSD-3CRV gauge. To maximize the impact of the LUSD Chicken Bonds, &lt;strong&gt;a bribing campaign&lt;/strong&gt; is also synchronized with the release to increase the CRV APY of LUSD/3CRV pool depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Warden Quest, LQTY tokens are awarded to veCRV and vlCVX voters on the LUSD/3CRV CRV gauge. The bribing campaign secured &lt;strong&gt;5M veCRV votes (~1% of total votes)&lt;/strong&gt;, which led to a sharp increase in the APY, bringing it to parity with a basic Stability Pool deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you out of the loop with the Curve Wars? Start here: &lt;br&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV wars: the race to accumulate the ability to influence the Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerpools-lucy-interest-bearing-lusd-lp-position&#34;&gt;PowerPool’s LUCY: interest-bearing LUSD LP position
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PowerPool team has been working on an interesting &lt;strong&gt;novel type of Balancer pool&lt;/strong&gt; suited for LUSD, and it’s now close to being released: the LUSD-a-bb-USD pool, also known under the sweet name of &lt;strong&gt;LUCY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Chicken Bonds, this pool &lt;strong&gt;harnesses b.protocol to provide an auto-compounded earning opportunity on LUSD&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the main innovation of this pool is to involve interest-bearing assets and constantly &lt;strong&gt;rebalances between yield-bearing and liquidity-providing activities&lt;/strong&gt;. The pool is made of two wrapper tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-balancer-boosted-aave-usd&#34;&gt;1/ Balancer Boosted Aave USD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pool is essentially the &lt;strong&gt;Balancer’s equivalent of Curve’s 3 pool&lt;/strong&gt;, the main stablecoin pool of the decentralized exchange. The key difference here is that the pool involves &lt;strong&gt;interest-bearing wrappers&lt;/strong&gt; of each stablecoin. Depending on the pool’s liquidity needs, each stablecoin rebalances between liquidity-providing or yield-bearing through Aave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/bbaUSD-pool-composition.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bbaUSD-pool-composition&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-lusd--bprotocol&#34;&gt;2/ LUSD + b.protocol
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bb-a-USD tokens are paired against LUSD, which also &lt;strong&gt;rebalances yield-bearing (Stability Pool with b.protocol) and liquidity-providing&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the LUCY pool should be interesting to grow LUSD’s available liquidity, as it could provide an interest yield-stacking option for liquity providers, earning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;swap fees APR&lt;/strong&gt;, collected on exchanges involving the pool’s tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;base yield&lt;/strong&gt; on each pool token (Aave’s yield for USDC/USDT/DAI, Stability Pool’s yields for LUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[If a BAL gauge is obtained] the &lt;strong&gt;LP token BAL staking APY&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be further increased with gauge votes and bribing campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel pool will mark the arrival of LUSD on Balancer, diversifying its liquidity source further, as the main venues to trade LUSD are currently Curve, Uniswap, and Velodrome on Optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-integrations-into-other-lending-protocols&#34;&gt;LUSD integrations into other lending protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, LUSD has been increasingly integrated across various DeFi protocols, providing &lt;strong&gt;additional options to LUSD holders and arbitrageurs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0&amp;amp;marketName=proto_mainnet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;addition of LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave&lt;/a&gt; marked the first time the stablecoin could be borrowed using collateral other than ETH to secure the position. As the liquidity available on the market grows, it opens LUSD arbitrage to non-ETH holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/lusd-chicken-bonds/lusd-aave-market.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;lusd-aave-market&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;LUSD was also added as collateral on two €-based lending protocols&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://angle.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Angle Money&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mimo.capital/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mimo&lt;/a&gt;. Both enable LUSD holders to enter a short position on €, using their LUSD as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gearbox.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GearBox&lt;/a&gt; is gearing up to release its V2 shortly, enabling users to get leverage according to a pre-determined and smart-contract-enforced set of rules. Amongst the options available at release, &lt;strong&gt;liquidity providers of the LUSD/3CRV will be able to leverage their position&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing the lending market of LUSD beyond Liquity grows the stablecoin utility while enabling more various types of users to arbitrage its price fluctuations. Paired with the ongoing efforts to grow LUSD’s liquidity on DEX, it will help stabilize its price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-on-optimism-velodrome-and-stargate&#34;&gt;LUSD on Optimism: Velodrome and Stargate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD also &lt;strong&gt;has a strong presence on Optimism&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to Liquity being one of the protocols involved in the Velodrome races. With a respectable veVELO position, Liquity has been able to grow several LUSD-related pools to sizeable TVL. Moreover, pools on Velodrome tend to be more balanced than the mainnet pools:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;lusd-velodrome&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, bridging LUSD to Optimism is currently a bit of a one-way trip. Bridging LUSD to Optimism is easy and only takes 5-10 min using the official bridge. However bridging back to the mainnet takes 7 days with the official bridge, and no alternative options with decent liquidity are available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is about to change, enabling LUSD’s strong liquidity on Optimism to positively impact the mainnet situation: Stargate, the omnichain liquidity transport protocol, recently voted to &lt;strong&gt;add support for LUSD&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xe6fef4aa9c8e9d162f694ab764b11c06918b9f199aafe43e0d85b12d8271011c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SIP#16&lt;/a&gt;), which will enable its fast bridging from and to Optimism once implemented. If Stargate can provide a reliable solution to fast bridge LUSD from Optimism to mainnet, it could positively impact mainnet’s LUSD liquidity pools balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, Liquity is the only &amp;ldquo;deployer.&amp;rdquo; This concept will gain relevance with the Generalized version of the Chicken Bonds, where other protocols can harness the model to benefit their tokens.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity driver tokens enable direct incentives to selected liquidity or lending pairs, usually through a locking system. They allow projects which lock them to direct emissions to pools of their choosing to attract liquidity.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Aave&#39;s GHO stablecoin help the protocol further grow and overtake MakerDAO and DAI?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/aave-gho-stablecoin/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/aave-gho-stablecoin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/aave-gho-stablecoin/aave-gho-stablecoin-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Can Aave&#39;s GHO stablecoin help the protocol further grow and overtake MakerDAO and DAI?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the concept for the GHO stablecoin was introduced on the Aave Governance Forum and triggered a wave of excitement across DeFi. Indeed, the idea of a decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin, pegged to USD and native to the Aave DAO makes a lot of sense as a next step for the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the design introduced before considering how the Aave DAO and team could bring it to market and turn it into a stablecoin potentially as significant as DAI. Of course, the information is still scarce, so the second part of the article will be primarily extrapolations stemming from my DeFi experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-gho-aaves-native-stablecoin&#34;&gt;Introduction to GHO, Aave&amp;rsquo;s native stablecoin
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its early days, one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s main challenges has been attracting sufficient stablecoin deposits since it&amp;rsquo;s a preferred choice for most borrowers. Thus, creating a stablecoin native to the DAO is a natural next step and should also allow lowering costs for borrowers. Since this stablecoin is minted, there is no need to pay the APR of the depositors on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the main characteristics of GHO as presented on the governance forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-overcollateralized-usd-pegged-stablecoin&#34;&gt;An overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO will be an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted using aTokens as collateral. So in a sense, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to MakerDAO but slightly more efficient since all collateral will be productive assets generating some interest (aTokens) – depending on their borrowing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the naming, it&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see Aave not including &amp;ldquo;USD&amp;rdquo; in the name. Considering how aggressive the US regulators can be, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a net benefit from a legal perspective. Still, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the only driver of the decision, as Aave&amp;rsquo;s founder Stani hinted at a potential peg swap further down the line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to a currency has limitations over long term, potentially you might want to swap the peg from one underlying asset to another (for various reasons) or track something else and being bound to a USD in the ticker would be a limiting factor. On top of that everyone is doing that already which makes it a bit repetitive and restrictive from the messaging perspective. DAI follows the same path actually and has been helpful to build a narrative over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stani on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-gho/8730/27&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&amp;rsquo;s GHO introduction post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interest-model-and-stkaave-discount&#34;&gt;Interest model and stkAAVE discount
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interest rate model for GHO is currently its most underwhelming component, as the initial post envisioned an interest rate directly determined by the Aave DAO, just like how it works on Maker. However, that would be inefficient and add unnecessary bloat to the governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community feedback will dictate where it goes. Still, I genuinely hope for Aave that the final call lands on a model where the interest rate is algorithmically determined by market conditions, just like with other tokens on Aave where the supply/demand on the pool dictates the interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Aave community feels like it is a necessity to involve the DAO in determining the interest rate — an absurdity in my book since a DAO is absolutely unfit to manage the operational parameters of a system — then a hybrid model could be envisioned with a fixed base rate voted on by the DAO, and modulated within a range depending on the market condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, having the interest rate evolve dynamically can help protect GHO&amp;rsquo;s peg by deterring against massive minting events, just like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/lusd-redemptions#how-is-the-baserate-calculated&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how the baseRate works on Liquity&lt;/a&gt; to protect LUSD from de-pegging downward. Initially, at 0.5%, the fee rises when demand surges to progressively decays back to 0.5% as the demand stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post also mentions a discount for GHO borrowers staking AAVE tokens, creating further synergies. Finally, 100% of the interest rates paid by depositors will go to the Aave DAO (vs. a Reserve Factor in the ~10% range for most other tokens), meaning that if GHO grows to a significant market cap, it could turn into a goldmine for the DAO. &lt;strong&gt;With a market cap similar&amp;rsquo;s to DAI, and an average interest rate of 3.5% (high-end), AaveDAO would earn close to $150K daily from GHO&amp;rsquo;s interest rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick napkin maths with different GHO market cap and interest rate assumptions to give you an idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GHO Marketcap: 1.5B = FRAX&amp;rsquo;s current supply, 6.6B is DAI&amp;rsquo;s, and 52B is USDC — one can dream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GHO Average Interest Rate: 1% would be highly competitive, 3.5% in the higher-end of the usual rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilitators-and-rwa&#34;&gt;Facilitators and RWA
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO&amp;rsquo;s design envisions &amp;ldquo;Facilitators,&amp;rdquo; onboarded by Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance, that would be able to mint GHO. The first facilitator would be the Aave protocol itself, but others will follow suit, be they protocols or entities. This part is exciting, as it widely opens up GHO&amp;rsquo;s design space. Following the release, we could see other protocols applying to become facilitators and building on top of Aave and GHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/aave-gho-stablecoin/gho-facilitators.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gho-facilitators&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also explicit mentions of undercollateralized positions based on credentials such as a credit score. Each facilitator will have a maximal GHO minting capacity determined by the DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-and-absence-of-censorship-resistance&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Decentralization&amp;rdquo; and absence of censorship resistance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GHO is presented as a decentralized stablecoin by the Aave team, with even some mentions of censorship resistance. However, it&amp;rsquo;s never directly associated with GHO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of stablecoins will only continue to grow as cryptoassets become further integrated with a user base that is less crypto-native. Decentralized stablecoins provide censorship-resistant fiat-denominated currency on the blockchain. Introducing, GHO, a decentralized multi-collateral stablecoin that is fully backed and native to the Aave Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I&amp;rsquo;ve misunderstood the design, GHO will be &lt;strong&gt;as &amp;ldquo;decentralized&amp;rdquo; as DAI and have weak censorship resistance&lt;/strong&gt; because of its collateral composition. Indeed, assuming that all aTokens that can be currently used as collateral to borrow on Aave will also be used to borrow GHO, GHO&amp;rsquo;s collateral composition will be mostly made of censorable tokens such as USDC:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;DeFiLlama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed excluding stETH used as collateral to leverage the ETH staking yield (borrowing ETH), USDC is the top collateral used on Aave, with another trusted token (wBTC) not far behind. &lt;strong&gt;Still, the collateral composition would be much better than DAI,&lt;/strong&gt; which is &amp;gt;50% backed by pure USDC.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;dai-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ~25% of the backing comes from other trust-required collateral or reflexive liquity providing positions (such as DAI/USDC LP used as collateral to mint DAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the envisioned design for GHO, feel free to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-gho/8730&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the governance forum post&lt;/a&gt; and the replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gho-to-market-what-could-aave-with-gho-look-like&#34;&gt;GHO to market: What could Aave with GHO look like?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the stage is set regarding GHO, we can move into a more speculative territory and consider how the GHO release could unfold in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the interaction between the Aave protocol and GHO is quite exciting to consider: while the initial post mention Aave x GHO, as well as the enablement of the eMode (enabling significant leverage on selected pairs such as USDC/DAI) on GHO, it quite scarce in details, so let me share instead how I envision it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aGHO would be fascinating collateral on Aave, but it could also create significant reflexive risks if allowed to borrow GHO. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;I expect aGHO to be blocked from minting GHO&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent reflexive backing like we&amp;rsquo;re currently seeing on DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it would allow for exciting stablecoin arbitrage loops, such as aUSDC &amp;gt; Mint GHO &amp;gt; aGHO &amp;gt; Borrow another stablecoin. With the eMode, this would make Aave &amp;amp; GHO a very effective protocol for stablecoin arbitrage. Besides, the GHO interest rate would become a kind of &amp;ldquo;base stablecoin interest rate&amp;rdquo; and maybe help keep the interest rate of other stablecoins like USDC in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ghos-liquidity-strategy&#34;&gt;GHO&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical and essential part of any stablecoin&amp;rsquo;s design is its liquidity strategy. Since CRV, CVX, and BAL are accepted as collateral on Aave, there could be exciting things done with the CRV, CVX, and BAL accumulated by the treasury, thanks to the Reserve Factor. Locking them into their native protocols would enable the Aave DAO to direct incentives to GHO-related pools.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Aave’s Treasury Report&lt;/a&gt; (July 2022)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Frax is currently pivoting away from USDT and DAI and trying to establish the Frax Basepool (FRAX/USDC) as a pairing currency on Curve for other stablecoins, we could envision a similar move from Aave. Moreover, many projects currently exposed to USDC and DAI are looking to diversify their liquidity away from them. GHO might arrive with perfect timing to enable DeFi to be less reliant on USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while Frax controls sizeable governance and gauge-voting power in the Curve Wars, this is not the case for the Aave DAO. Current treasury CRV/CVX balances will clearly be insufficient to incentivize pools to grow into the billion dollar range, so it could drive the AaveDAO to look into acquiring more liquidity-incentive-driver tokens. With the significant revenues that the DAO will collect from GHO&amp;rsquo;s interest rate, it should have sufficient means to support appropriate liquidity, whatever GHO&amp;rsquo;s market cap ends up being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Aave has been historically close to Balancer, with the 80% AAVE / 20% wETH Balancer Pool used in the Safety Module since the transition to the AAVE token. The treasury currently owns 200k BAL and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;another acquisition is planned&lt;/a&gt;. Thus we could expect an exciting play for GHO on Balancer. Yet when it comes to stablecoin, Curve remains both the king and king-maker: I don&amp;rsquo;t see how Aave could sufficiently grow GHO&amp;rsquo;s liquidity without getting involved one way or another in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the CRV wars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the base protocol incentives (such as the dynamic or DAO-governed borrowing interest rate) and liquidation mechanism, the liquidity strategy is probably one of the most crucial element for a stablecoin since it also has an impact on how well the peg is held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand what is at stake in the stablecoin wars. The end of the year will be interesting, with the GHO release approaching and Curve&amp;rsquo;s stablecoin, also overcollateralized, which was hinted to release before the end of this year. The multiplication of stablecoin is a natural next step for DeFi, as most established protocols see their design converge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frax started as a stablecoin only, now has FraxSwap and soon FraxLend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave started as a money market, soon with its own native stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve started as a DEX, but the addition of its own stablecoin soon could enable efficient borrowing for liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, as shown with my napkin maths earlier, the main reason for a protocol to create its stablecoin is quite apparent: it&amp;rsquo;s where there is the most money to be made, as well as massive demand and product/market fit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Behind the scene of the decentralization theater: a study of the inalterability of DeFi protocols</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/unstoppable-defi/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/unstoppable-defi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/unstoppable-defi-tokenbrice-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Behind the scene of the decentralization theater: a study of the inalterability of DeFi protocols" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance has allowed the emergence of autonomous protocols whose functionalities are ensured by smart contracts that are sometimes immutable. It enables individuals from all over the world to use financial services that are at the same time sovereign, accessible, and more efficient and resilient than those available in traditional finance. It&amp;rsquo;s the lovely story that newcomers are told to lull them to sleep: the reality is much more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;a handful of protocols fit this reality,&lt;/strong&gt; but most are far from being up to par. When the bulls are out, interest in the resilience of the protocols is generally shallow: the only thing that matters is price appreciation. But the bears have made a comeback, and thankfully it means a renewed interest in these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent implosion of the Luna ecosystem and its associated stablecoin, UST, will hopefully serve as a wake-up call for some. It was, unfortunately, a &lt;strong&gt;perfectly avoidable&lt;/strong&gt; disaster. The model used for this stablecoin and its flaws were already known, with many previous instances covered on this blog: BAC, MIC, ESD, DSD, etc. (at the application level on Ethereum rather than the protocol level, but with the same fundamental problems). They all had the same end: an endless spiral that brought them closer to absolute 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of this event, many investors have become aware that not all stablecoins are created equal and seek to learn more about the resilience of the many stablecoins available on the market and the robustness of different DeFi protocols in general. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m seizing this exceptional moment to discuss this essential topic for the sustainability of DeFi; it has been a passion of mine for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, last year I already proposed to you an exhaustive analysis of the risks incurred on the borrowing services in DeFi and how to evaluate them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is still relevant and a highly recommended read for any informed investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the introduction. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the point and define the term &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo; and what it implies in concrete terms at a protocol level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-unstoppable-defi-protocol&#34;&gt;What is an unstoppable DeFi protocol?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, we can call &lt;strong&gt;a DeFi protocol unstoppable &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when its essential functions are provided by smart contracts that are not modifiable, and it does not require external intervention to subsist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this relatively straightforward definition, I must add many notes and clarifications to cover the diversity of DeFi protocols and their use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-third-party-protocol-dependencies&#34;&gt;⚠️ Third-party protocol dependencies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, it is infrequent that a protocol does everything by itself. More often than not, a given protocol relies on various third-party protocols. Of course, the most common and well-known case is the oracle - the source of prices for assets - a critical component for borrowing services in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dependence-on-oracles-like-chainlink&#34;&gt;Dependence on oracles like ChainLink
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the most widely used oracle is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ChainLink&lt;/a&gt;. Although technically robust, the industry recently got a reminder, thanks to Chris Blec and a few other actors concerned about the resilience of the service: ChainLink&amp;rsquo;s oracles are susceptible to manipulation or censorship. The riskiest attack vector seems to be &lt;strong&gt;the 3/20 multisig&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows the price source for a given asset to be changed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, if three people synchronize among these 20, they could change the ETH/USD oracle, for example, for an in-house oracle that returns a price of $1, and almost all DeFi loans would be liquidated in the process. However, it seems rather unlikely that people on or close to the ChainLink team would carry out such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant risk seems to be an &lt;strong&gt;attack by an external actor&lt;/strong&gt; who would like to harm the whole of DeFi. Indeed, with such a permissive multisig, it would be &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; to identify three or more members of this multisig, kidnap them and threaten them to change a price source of ChainLink. It is the famous &amp;ldquo;🔧 wrench attack.&amp;rdquo; No matter how secure the smart contracts are, if they are administered by a multisig, they are vulnerable to this type of attack that goes through the people behind the protocols rather than the code directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is not the existence of this multisig, which is necessary to update and improve the services that ChainLink provides, but its setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/20 is extraordinarily permissive&lt;/strong&gt; and riskier from a 🔧 wrench attack point of view than 3/6, for example (which would have fewer potential targets to perform the attack). A more reasonable number aligned with what is usually done for 20 signers in total would be something between 8 and 12 signers required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No timelock&lt;/strong&gt;: so changes are immediate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚠️ Update - May 27&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 23rd (5 days after the publication of this article), the Multisig setup has been updated to a 4/9, which makes a 🔧 wrench attack harder to perform; there is still no timelock&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dependence-on-other-protocols-that-are-less-resilient-than-the-base-protocol&#34;&gt;Dependence on other protocols that are less resilient than the base protocol
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating elements in DeFi is &lt;strong&gt;composability&lt;/strong&gt;: protocols integrate and use each other. While this allows for the emergence of synergies and innovative use cases, it also comes with additional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, as we will come back to it later, we will take as an example PoolTogether, one of the most resilient protocols of the DeFi and quasi-unstoppable. The quasi comes from its external dependencies and, more precisely, the sources of yields used: Compound or Aave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the smart contracts of PoolTogether are immutable except for the part that manages the price allocation (v4). Still, the funds are deployed in protocols powered by smart contracts that can be altered (such as adding a new collateral, a necessary feature but also a potential attack vector&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general rule is that a protocol is as resilient as the weakest link in its composability chain&lt;/strong&gt;. This rule is not absolute, as it is still possible to mitigate or contain the exposure taken with integrations, for example, by implementing redundancy, as we will see below in the detailed assesments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-access-to-protocols-the-question-of-websites-front-end&#34;&gt;⚠️ Access to protocols: the question of websites (front-end)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this topic, there are two key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the access point to the protocol (= the website/front-end) resilient / can it be censored, for example, by a state actor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the site secure? Can a malicious actor attack it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;risk-of-censorship-of-the-front-end&#34;&gt;Risk of censorship of the front-end
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, I must start by reminding you of a fundamental point: a DeFi service exists thanks to a set of smart contracts. It is &lt;strong&gt;entirely possible to interact with any DeFi service by going directly through the contracts&lt;/strong&gt; - and thus, even if their site were to be inaccessible. Of course, not all DeFi users have the technical skills required to interact with smart contracts directly, which is why &lt;strong&gt;the front-end issue remains essential&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, protocols that maximize their resilience need to think about it. Two main approaches are possible and can be combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a protocol can have &lt;strong&gt;multiple access points&lt;/strong&gt; that allow access to its service: if one of them were inaccessible, others would remain online, thus causing only minor inconvenience to the service users. For example, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt; can be used through the main app.aave.com site, but also through tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://instadapp.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;InstaDapp&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, most of these sites are still hosted by &lt;strong&gt;centralized services&lt;/strong&gt; that could all be censored simultaneously: it&amp;rsquo;s more work, but it&amp;rsquo;s technically possible. To overcome this limitation, another option is available: having one or more &lt;strong&gt;sites hosted via a decentralized solution like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ipfs.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in terms of front-end resilience, the most original, elegant, and efficient approach deployed to date is probably the one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; protocol. Indeed, Liquity does not have an official website for its application deployed and managed directly by the team. Instead, the team provides &lt;strong&gt;a kit to deploy a front-end&lt;/strong&gt; of Liquity, usable by all. Because of this approach, the project now has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/frontend&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a myriad of different sites to use its service&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are hosted on IPFS:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;security-risks-of-front-end&#34;&gt;Security risks of front-end
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, one should not forget that a front-end remains a website. Even if it is not censored, &lt;strong&gt;it may be susceptible to attacks&lt;/strong&gt; of varying degrees of severity: the websites of the decentralized exchange SpiritSwap and QuickSwap, for example, have recently &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX/status/1525306033400188928?s=20&amp;amp;t=UKpcM2Gu6nZ9Kgl65kmp3w&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;suffered from such a scenario&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack vector is linked to the service&amp;rsquo;s domain name manager (GoDaddy). Other types of attacks are possible: for example, code injections through a third-party service that the site integrates, as we recently saw on EtherScan, as an advertising tracker they use was compromised (CoinZilla).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ℹ-limitations-of-unstoppable-protocols&#34;&gt;ℹ️ Limitations of unstoppable protocols
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unstoppable protocols cannot cover all use cases. Indeed, depending on the complexity of a protocol, it is sometimes impossible to avoid any dependency on another protocol that is itself at least partially censurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one must keep in mind the counterpart that comes with the immutability of the smart contracts of unstoppable protocols: &lt;strong&gt;an update of these is technically impossible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when an unstoppable protocol needs to evolve, there is only one possible path: deploy a new version of the protocol (with its new set of immutable contracts) and encourage the &lt;strong&gt;migration&lt;/strong&gt; of its users to it. This is, for example, what Uniswap has done twice, with the migration to version 2 in May 2020 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and then again one year later with the release of Uniswap v3 in May 2021 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;UNIv2-migration-tool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the differences between the versions, the protocol may also offer a tool to facilitate migration, as was the case for UNIv1⇒UNIv2. However, it was impossible for UNIv2⇒UNIv3 mainly because of the introduction of liquidity concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-spectrum-of-resilience&#34;&gt;The Spectrum of Resilience
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve established the definition of &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo; with all the necessary precisions, I propose to move directly to the analysis. Before digging into the relevant protocols, let me offer you a spectrum that highlights different levels of resilience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/resilience-spectrum-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-spectrum-resilience-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing centralized or &amp;ldquo;DINO&amp;rdquo; (Decentralized in Name Only) protocols, decentralized in name only, is not very insightful, so I will let you dig for yourself. Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s look at protocols on the more exciting end of the spectrum: to the right of MakerDAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-the-most-resilient-dex&#34;&gt;Analysis of the most resilient DEX
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the resilience of Uniswap and Curve, we need to recall a few crucial things about decentralized exchanges. Specifically, they have two types of users who assume pretty different levels of risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users who exchange tokens through the DEX. These users bear the risks linked to the DEX smart contracts for the time of the swap only (as well as those related to unlimited &amp;ldquo;approve&amp;rdquo; if the DEX contract is compromised and is not immutable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity providers are exposed as long as their position is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Uniswap as on Curve, &lt;strong&gt;the contracts relating to the two situations are immutable&lt;/strong&gt;. It is technically impossible to envisage a &amp;ldquo;rug&amp;rdquo; of the liquidity providers, which is not the case for all DEXs: such an attack was possible on SushiSwap once because of their migration function. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that DEXs relying on an Automated Market Maker such as Uniswap or Curve do &lt;strong&gt;not need an oracle to work&lt;/strong&gt;, which significantly reduces their dependency on potentially censorable third-party services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if the contracts are immutable, the risk is not zero for the liquidity providers who assume all the risks related to the tokens involved in the pair. The general rule here is similar to that of the composability chain: &lt;strong&gt;a given LP position is as risky as its most dangerous token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front-end issue for DEX is less critical since many access points exist. The most competent users go through a decentralized exchange aggregator, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;uniswap&#34;&gt;Uniswap
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contracts core functions are completely immutable on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://uniswap.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&lt;/a&gt; v1, v2 and v3. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V2&lt;/a&gt; release markededthe introduction of an administrative fee the governance can decided to turn on&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (= to the protocol), as already seen on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the case is straightforward. If there is indeed a governance, the good news (less for UNI holders) is that what it can do is very limited. &lt;strong&gt;No seizure or migration of funds is possible&lt;/strong&gt;. Apart from the fee, it manages matters such as deploying Uniswap on a new chain, adding a new tier of fees (1bps for stablecoins), or using the protocol&amp;rsquo;s treasury &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, to fund liquidity mining campaigns or to distribute UNI to friendly people who ask for it, without any limit or accounting &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curve-finance&#34;&gt;Curve Finance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve Finance&lt;/a&gt; is another example of resilient DEX with an equally exciting approach. Again, the essential functions are provided by immutable contracts. Nevertheless, Curve also has an &amp;ldquo;Emergency DAO&amp;rdquo; whose members are elected by the governance. This Emergency DAO can &amp;ldquo;kill&amp;rdquo; a pool (only if pools that are younger than 2 months old and not factory pools): all functions except withdrawal are disabled. It prevents further loss of funds if a problem emerges with Curve&amp;rsquo;s contracts. The Emergency DAO can also kill a gauge - that is the reward contract handling CRV (and potentially other token) rewards. Killed gauges can then be resurrected by the main DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Uniswap, Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance is centered around the management of CRV token issuance and management. However, the model is much more refined here; I invite you to read my previous articles on the subject to better understand it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;⚔ Advanced CRV Wars: Analysis of Protocols Built on Curve and Convex &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Uniswap, participation in Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance requires locking CRV tokens ( ⇒veCRV) for up to four years for those who want to maximize their influence. Thus, it protects the governance from different types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the governance also manages a whitelist of smart contracts authorized to interact with the veCRV contract &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: such decisions are consequential for liquidity providers on Curve and CRV owners in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance is one of the most fascinating to follow in DeFi. To help it make more informed decisions, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://substack.com/profile/66151946-crypto-risk-assessments&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a newsletter offering risk assesments of the various protocols that require a gauge&lt;/a&gt; has been set up. I highly recommend reading it; it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent source for perfecting one&amp;rsquo;s understanding of risk in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-depth-analysis-of-other-notable-protocols&#34;&gt;In-depth analysis of other notable protocols
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to decentralized exchanges, other types of protocols get as close as possible to the most resilient end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, the use cases of the protocols we will detail now are more complex and cannot be served, to my knowledge, without dependencies on other more or less censorable services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity&#34;&gt;Liquity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is a dogged project that aims to create the most resilient borrowing system and stablecoin while maintaining an economically efficient system for borrowers. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail about this protocol here, I invite you to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the points relevant to our topic of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquity&amp;rsquo;s code is entirely immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquity has no governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, like any borrowing service, Liquity depends on an oracle (ETH price in USD). Here, ChainLink is used, but a backup system is also in place. Calculations are made to determine if the data provided by ChainLink is deemed reliable. If it is not, the system automatically switches to a secondary price source as long as it is needed: the Tellor oracle. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, as I mentioned above, Liquity also has an interesting approach to maximizing front-end decentralization.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this approach, Liquity is the most resilient borrowing protocol available on Ethereum, allowing LUSD to sweep the title of the most robust and decentralized stablecoin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pooltogether&#34;&gt;PoolTogether
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating protocol that explores a new concept: &amp;ldquo;no-loss&amp;rdquo;. Concretely, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/pool-together-v5/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is a prize-linked savings account where the player takes no financial risk on his principal: the game relies entirely on the yield produced by the principal. It redistributes it to the different players according to their luck at the draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/unstoppable-defi/pooltogether.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pooltogether&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this protocol, I invite you once again to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pool-together.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the resilience of the protocol. Here, the main issue is &lt;strong&gt;the initial source of yield, which is external&lt;/strong&gt;: it comes from services like Aave or Compound, which are not unstoppable. Thus, a PoolTogether player assumes this risk on his entire deposit: the principal and the yield generated (before it is collected and redirected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this third-party dependency, the PoolTogetger protocol is remarkably resilient. Indeed, on the PoolTogether side, &lt;strong&gt;contracts are as immutable as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, they are all immutable (so a given pool cannot change its source of yield), except for the prize distribution part, which only affects the yields generated. Indeed, the prize distribution model can change following a governance vote (mainnet) or a multisig operation (Avalanche/Polygon), which is necessary because cross-chain governance is not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is fascinating and unique in DeFi: PoolTogether is a no-loss prize-linked savings account. This (financial) design principle also manifests itself in smart contracts. A player cannot lose his principal, excluding a problem with Aave/Compound or a critical bug in the PoolTogether contracts. The code itself guarantees this; only the return is potentially at risk. Even if the entire PoolTogether team suffers a 🔧 wrench attack or PoolTogether&amp;rsquo;s governance turns hostile. So &lt;strong&gt;the promise of no loss is upheld at the smart-contract level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also nuances and differences between V3 and V4 of the protocol as far as risks are concerned. The best thing is to carefully read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.pooltogether.com/security/risks&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trustlessfi-&#34;&gt;TrustlessFi 🏗️
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://trustless.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Trustless&lt;/a&gt; is a protocol that I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with lately. It&amp;rsquo;s not live yet, but I think the approach has a lot of merits. To describe it very simply, &lt;strong&gt;TrustlessFi is like Liquity and Reflexer having a child together on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the goal is, as with Liquity, to create a protocol that will eventually be as unstoppable as possible, and the associated stablecoin (HUE) will inherit this property. Other mechanisms are similar to Liquity, such as ETH as the only collateral, immediate liquidations, or decentralization of the front-end (with a community validation mechanism this time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the governance side, we have here an approach similar to the Reflexer/RAI de-governance plan but more engaging: 4 phases are envisaged, and at each stage, the control of the Foundation and the community decreases making the protocol more and more immutable. These &lt;strong&gt;phases will be implemented in the code of the contracts themselves&lt;/strong&gt;: it is possible to delay the transition to a new phase by 45 days up to three times if necessary, but it is impossible to cancel this transition altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanism similar to Maker-MCD&amp;rsquo;s Dai Saving Rate allows participation in the system without necessarily needing to generate debt. HUE owners will be able to stake it to get a return from the interest rates paid by the borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are also some fascinating new features, such as that Troves/CDPs will be tokenized as NFTs, allowing their transfer. Another example is the deployment of HUE liquidity in Uniswap v3 (HUE/ETH), managed by the protocol. At the oracle level, we would also have an unstoppable price source using Uniswap v3, but this undoubtedly comes with increased manipulation risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the approach is going in the right direction. Still, there are many new concepts in this protocol, so it is not easy to anticipate the result once it is available in production for the time being &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-last-clarifications&#34;&gt;Conclusion and last clarifications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that this definite article can serve as a reference for all those who have essential questions about the resilience of DeFi protocols. As usual, rather than delivering assesments as is, I have tried to detail as much as possible the methodology and reasoning so that you can study for yourself the resilience of any protocol not mentioned in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go deeper, I warmly invite you to read an article I published last year, which perfectly complements this one, focused on money markets. It proposes a method of analysis to evaluate the different potential risks they imply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that such a precise analysis of such a critical subject could arouse more or less positive emotions. Please know that, as always, my intention is only &lt;strong&gt;to inform as many DeFians as possible on matters that I consider essential for DeFi in general.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My educational and pedagogical actions in DeFi have no other purpose than maximizing the resilience and relevance of decentralized finance over the long term. I hope that developers or promoters of protocols to the left of my suggested resilience spectrum will also understand and recognize this mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention throughout this article the unstoppability of some DeFi protocols: we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the immutability of smart contract code here. The order of transactions on Ethereum can still be manipulated (⇒ MEV), and miners keep an essential role (until the transition to PoS). The contractual unstoppability discussed in this article thus has infrastructural limits.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Announcement: Joining Liquity to bolster the growth of unstoppable DeFi</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/joining-liquity/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/joining-liquity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/tokenbrice-liquity/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcement: Joining Liquity to bolster the growth of unstoppable DeFi" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little less involved in the DeFi discussion lately  and you might righfully wonder why. First, I needed to slow down and take some time for myself, and the timing could not be better. While I was off, I had the time to reflect on what drew me to DeFi in the first place and how the space has evolved since I started getting involved about four years ago. Watching protocols with massive design flaws blowing up is reassuring, especially to those who anticipated it, but not exactly what I dreamed of when I discovered DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;has-defi-lost-its-way&#34;&gt;Has DeFi lost its way?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems like we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our ways. TradFi turned into the non-sensical monster we know not on purpose nor by design: it was simply the result of every person and entity trying to pull the blanket to themselves: &lt;strong&gt;an accumulation of individual&amp;rsquo;s greed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments during this last year in DeFi felt very similar to TradFi&amp;rsquo;s avarice: in terms of building a resilient and self-sovereign financial system for all, close to nothing was achieved. Instead, most of the releases were focused on delivering yet another flavor of ponzinomics to sustain the greed of apes for a few weeks until they move to the next shiny farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that what &lt;strong&gt;we need in the end-game are systems able to resist the (potentially coordinated) attacks of states, organized crime, and whales&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the current protocols available in DeFi would not stand a day against structured attacks of significant magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large share of &amp;ldquo;DeFi&amp;rdquo; protocols are vulnerable to the good old wrench attack because of their reliance on multisigs: identifying, locating and threatening a dozen individuals is not an arduous task, especially when billions are at stake. Economic attacks can also seriously affect another significant share of DeFi protocols, especially if perpetrated by an actor willing to burn money in the process. Finally, governance attacks are so commonplace it&amp;rsquo;s not even exciting to cover them anymore. It is not the DeFi I signed up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built a platform and shed light on the projects that brought something new and relevant to the table during the last few years. Complimentary to my analysis and commentaries, I&amp;rsquo;ve supported several projects, shared my insights with creative and sensible teams, and sometimes been involved in the governance processes. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt ready to assume a more active role within the ecosystem: today is the day! I&amp;rsquo;m confident my honest, sometimes brutal, yet always informed approach was and still is something lacking in the industry where shills are king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;announcing-tokenbrice-x-liquity&#34;&gt;Announcing: TokenBrice x Liquity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; as Head of Marketing to support the growth of protocol, mainly focusing on a yet-to-be-announced project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Liquity protocol is just over a year old, the team has already been active and building for much longer. What has been achieved is truly unique, remarkable, and needed. Liquity is the &lt;strong&gt;first and still only lending service available in DeFi that is  unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What always amazed me is that this feat is delivered without compromising on the protocol&amp;rsquo;s efficiency: Liquity is extremely cost-efficient, and the protocol&amp;rsquo;s design is one of rare elegance. Liquity is &lt;strong&gt;built like mission-critical software&lt;/strong&gt;: failure is not an option. I&amp;rsquo;m glad such a protocol, truthful to the root spirit of DeFi, exists, and I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to get the chance to help it grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar yet with what Liquity does and why it matters, feel free this intro:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/liquity-protocol.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-will-i-do&#34;&gt;What will I do?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Liquity, I&amp;rsquo;ll spearhead the growth efforts through all relevant channels: documentation, content strategy, media, events, and more, without forgetting, of course, to fuel the memetic. While I&amp;rsquo;ll mostly focus on an upcoming and yet to be announced product, I&amp;rsquo;ll also support the existing one in all relevant ways. With my efforts to craft and grow Liquity&amp;rsquo;s narrative, the community&amp;rsquo;s support, I&amp;rsquo;m confident Liquity&amp;rsquo;s prime time is yet to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still entirely convinced that great things are built from the bottom-up: I&amp;rsquo;ll be in close touch with the Liquity&amp;rsquo;s community to incorporate its insights and feedback at every possible level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m excited by the mission, my latest time-off taught me a lot about work/life balance: therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep my involvement with Liquity part-time. It lets me make sure I still have the time for a healthy personal life and hobbies, including DeFi, such as conducting my research and sharing them with you on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my live shows on Twitch, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to the weekly rhythm I used to have, but I&amp;rsquo;m not excluding some occasional shows to discuss relevant protocols and topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled for this next step of my journey and eager to share more with you regarding what is coming next for unstoppable DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤗 Thanks to all my readers and listeners for your support so far. I have several upcoming blog posts with unique insights to share with you in the coming months, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex </title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars-l2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/curve-wars-l2-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ Advanced CRV warfare: analysis of protocols built on top of Curve and Convex " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game and the fight around CRV and CVX tokens have changed in scope since my last article describing the original Curve Wars, now almost primitive. The infrastructure around Curve has become much denser with the arrival of Convex of course, but also Votium, Union Llama Airforce, Concentrator, CCRV, Lendflare, Warden, and many other protocols still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume a strategic position on CRV or CVX, one must now be able to support an investment of several tens of millions of dollars. Thus, the race to accumulate CVX and CRV has become primarily a game for DAOs or whales. More specifically, DAOs seem to prefer CVX to CRV, which represents a more favorable trade-off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosts LP Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: ability to build liquidity via votes on Curve gauges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yields&lt;/strong&gt;: 4-5% in cvxCRV + potential bribe yields if capacity is not used (or the protocol also use bribes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;: CVX can be used to its maximum capacity by committing 16 weeks + 3 days (vlCVX) while CRV requires up to 4 years of commitment (1 CRV = veCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to extract the utility of CRV, CVX is a credible and more flexible alternative, which is why most DAOs focus on this token. Convex Finance has become a &amp;ldquo;functional L2&amp;rdquo; of Curve: a second layer that brings new features and a different set of tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Convex is not the only project that tried to realize this vision: there was also Yearn, which has now capitulated: Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Curve vaults are essentially through Convex, which is now more profitable. Since then, many projects are trying to offer a synergistic brick with the Curve/Convex behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crv-or-cvx&#34;&gt;CRV or CVX?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the basics of the separation between the two tokens here, that&amp;rsquo;s a matter for an entire article if you&amp;rsquo;re new to the subject: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence the Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be kept in mind that despite the computable equivalence between CVX and CRV (1vl CVX controls about 4.8 veCRV - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/Marcov/Convex-Finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), the two tokens have different tradeoffs as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between CRV and CVX tends to hold, despite frequent swings: lately, the pendulum seems to swing more towards CVX. Nevertheless I think there is still room for other approaches that start from the source (CRV) and they are starting to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paladin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing a protocol that helps liquidity providers on Curve maximize their returns and perhaps achieve the desirable 2.5x bonus by borrowing the capacity of veCRV tokens (provided by others) paid directly in CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are so many other subtleties and interactions to keep in mind in order to understand the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects, DAOs and protocols to win the Curve Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why this article proposes to review the CRV and CVX wars &lt;strong&gt;by visualizing and detailing the whole ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; that has developed around these two protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an image to describe this trend of multiplication of supports used to interact with Curve/Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to confuse the term with &amp;ldquo;true L2s&amp;rdquo; / scaling L2s: the term in its original sense to describe a new chain that inherits the security of its parent while allowing for higher transaction throughput and more moderate costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we start with Curve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Functional L2s&lt;/strong&gt;, then Convex&amp;rsquo;s (itself a Curve L2), then borrowing services to leverage the many sources of return offered by the entire Curve ecosystem, and we&amp;rsquo;ll finish with the CRV/CVX protocol-whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a dense and colorful adventure, but as is often the case with my articles, I&amp;rsquo;m offering you a summary of my research on the subject: enjoy your reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lose you on the way, I propose you this map which summarizes the main actors of the Curve/Convex ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convex-finance-curve-by-the-slice&#34;&gt;Convex Finance: Curve by the slice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is the first functional L2 of Curve; other projects preceded it (yveCRV and sdveCRV) but they were not as synergistic with Curve and therefore only marginally successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Convex provides access to maximized and liquid CRV token returns through cvxCRV. The ability to govern and vote on the Curve gauges corresponding to the underlying veCRV tokens is redirected to the owners of vlCVX. Convex thus provides easy access to the Curve ecosystem (for veCRV owners).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Convex controls a large amount of vlCVX, the centralization of voting power on gauges is avoided by offering this capability to the highest bidder through Votium (bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex is now basic, so I won&amp;rsquo;t detail it further here. My previous article on CRV Warfare went into more depth on the model and the contributions of Convex: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚔ CRV Warfare: Understanding the race to accumulate the ability to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warden-of-paladin-curve-on-steroids&#34;&gt;Warden of Paladin: Curve on steroids?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.warden.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; is another possible path for Curve LPs, which offers a different set of tradeoffs to Convex. Warden does not directly control veCRVs, but instead offers to rent the boosting capacity of LP Curve from veCRVs owned by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental is paid directly in CRVs and by the week. It comes from veCRV owners who make it available, for the price and duration of their choice. The deal is concluded through the delegation of the corresponding veCRVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-veboost.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LP Ve boost rental on Warden&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden thus returns to the LP Curve boost game. On Convex, most pools are boosted between 1.5 and 1.7x via Convex. Having your own stock of veCRV, increased by a Warden loan, allows you to reach 2x or even 2.5x maximum on certain pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Warden even offers a handy calculator to visualize the amount of veCRV needed to reach a given multiplier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/warden-calc.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Warden Calculator&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warden is therefore a credible alternative for protocols, DAOs and large carriers who would like to optimize their LP Curve in a perspective of maximizing the obtained CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;l2-convex&#34;&gt;L2 Convex
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convex is not yet one year old (May 2021) but given the preponderant place that the service already occupies, abstractions built on top of it were quick to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-convex-vote-auction&#34;&gt;Votium: Convex vote auction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Convex protocol concentrates the largest amount of veCRVs owned by a single entity. Nevertheless, the voting capacity corresponding to the veCRVs owned by Convex (obtained thanks to the cvxCRV) is distributed among all the owners of the CVX token that &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; it (vlCVX) for 16 weeks + 7 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via snapshot, they can mobilize their voting power directly on the Curve pool gauge of their choice. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt; is an additional layer built on top of this feature: Votium allows any project to allocate a budget to support a given Curve gauge. At the end of the round, the vlCVX owners who voted on this gauge share the rewards, according to their voting power: these are the famous bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/votium-bribes.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Votium bribes&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the impressive amount of veCRVs controlled by Convex, Votium has quickly emerged as &lt;strong&gt;an essential tool to establish and sustain a presence on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: consistent bribes on Votium can quickly make a Curve pool very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detail below the example of Frax Finance which offers around $5-7M of bribes each round; this allows to maintain attractive returns on the Frax/3CRV pool despite the massive dilution (the pool contains almost $3B of assets), and this without issuing their own token (FXS) for liquidity mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;llama-airforce-union-shared-management-of-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Llama Airforce Union: shared management of vlCVX
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bribes offered on Votium are very attractive: this allows vlCVX to reach a return &lt;strong&gt;of about 40% APR - most of which (90%) comes from the bribes&lt;/strong&gt;. However, managing your own vlCVX position has several constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas costs&lt;/strong&gt;, to lock in your vlCVX, but also to harvest the bribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is possible to delegate, this leads to a dispersion of the rewards (paid in a dozen different tokens -&amp;gt; gas fees). So small and medium vlCVX holders generally prefer to concentrate their vote on a given project: more practical, but it implies not forgetting to &lt;strong&gt;vote at each round&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Llama Airforce Union proposes to remedy these two main limitations, for the happiness of small holders as well as those who prefer a &lt;strong&gt;100% passive management of their vlCVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple: the Union pools the management of vlCVX. The only action required from the users is the delegation of their vlCVX voting power to the Union contract. Thereafter, the Union takes care of everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each round, the Union takes care of claiming all the obtained bribes, and sells them for cvxCRV (=mutualization/immense reduction of the impact of transaction fees).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obtained cvxCRV are then deposited in the Pounder, which stakes them with Convex and composes the yield automatically (uCRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union thus offers a relevant alternative for CVX owners who intend to maintain and compound their position over the long term. As always, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to pay attention to the fees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas fees are passed on and distributed to all Union users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fee of 2% of the total bribes received is also charged in each round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The vlCVX are not taken into account since they are simply delegated to the Union (about 2.5M CVX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Union has been a rapid success. The project originated from the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://llama.airforce/#/convex/flyer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Llama Airforce&lt;/a&gt;, an already well-known source of information within the Curve/Convex ecosystem, which no doubt contributed to its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;concentrator-aladdindao&#34;&gt;Concentrator (AladdinDAO)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://concentrator.aladdin.club/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Concentrator&lt;/a&gt; is a bit like the Union, but this time for liquidity providers. Thus the Concentrator proposes to manage LP Curve for its depositors: the rewards (CRV, CVX and potential other tokens) are automatically sold for cvxCRV and automatically composed (staking on Convex) via the aCRV wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is interesting and rather synergistic with Curve and Convex: it&amp;rsquo;s a bit unfortunate to see that CVX are sold for the moment, but explained by the lack of available wrapper for vlCVX. The service offered by Concentrator is therefore rather relevant for &lt;strong&gt;small and medium sized carriers who want to use their LP Curve to maximize their CRV&lt;/strong&gt; token exposure in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;congruent-ccrv-curveconvex-flywheel-optimization&#34;&gt;Congruent CCRV: Curve/Convex flywheel optimization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the current limitations of Convex (or feature for some) is that despite the fairly dense liquidity in the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool, it is often unbalanced. CvxCRV is liquid against CRV, but rarely at 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccrv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CCRV&lt;/a&gt; is therefore designed as a mechanism to help rebalance this pool, using both Curve and Convex. The principle is quite simple if you understand the mechanisms of Curve and Convex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/ccrv.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;CCRV.finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the cCRV token, backed by 1 cvxCRV. The protocol stakes all the cvxCRVs deposited to back cCRVs in Convex, in order to obtain a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of the Curve 3CRV pool: CRV, cvxCRV and cCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes on the 3CRV pool to help it grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism will launch with an initial allocation of 1M CRV (provided by Congruent DAO). This will airdrop 1M cCRV (via bribes) over the first few weeks of the token&amp;rsquo;s existence to help it launch quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the launch plan seems pretty solid, the sustainability of the mechanism still seems uncertain. The addition of fees could allow the CCRV protocol to have its own liquidity (and therefore return in CRV, CVX and 3 pool) which could fuel the bribes while reducing their effective cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cCRV is not yet launched but is intended to be a &lt;strong&gt;new optimization of the flywheel Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, cCRV is being developed by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://congruent.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Congruent&lt;/a&gt;, a DAO that develops &amp;ldquo;Governance as a Service&amp;rdquo; (GaaS) products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bent-the-convex-of-convex&#34;&gt;Bent: the Convex of Convex?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.bentfinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bent&lt;/a&gt; is a true L2 Convex / L3 of Curve. The main question that arises with this project is whether there is anything to gain by going down to this level of depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, Bent works like Convex works for Curve: Bent allows you to stake Curve LP tokens: they are then staked in Convex (by Bent), and you benefit from an additional return paid with their native token - BENT, in exchange for fees collected by Bent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bentfinance-fees.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Bentfinance-fees&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may notice, the fee structure is almost identical to Convex. Finally, just as Convex created its own representation of CRV (cvxCRV), Bent creates its representation of CVX, the bentCVX. This can also be locked (weBENT) exactly like CVX-&amp;gt;vlCVX, for 8 weeks to get an additional yield corresponding to the bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks (Curve gauge round), weBENT holders vote on Snapshot to allocate their voting capacity on the gauges of their choice. The votes of the weBENT holders are echoed via the CVX owned by BentFinance, themselves echoed in CRV vote by Convex: two levels of depth!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-relevant-abstraction&#34;&gt;A relevant abstraction?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said when discussing Bent, the question here is not whether the model is relevant since Convex is living proof of that. Nevertheless, Convex is not a zero-sum game compared to Curve, since the protocol has brought new features that did not exist with just Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farm with LP Curve optimized, without having veCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Liquid Locking&amp;rdquo; (⚠ cvxCRV/CRV exchange rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the third point which is a bit of a consequence of the other two: Convex is now the biggest veCRV owner, and can therefore offer the bribe service (via Votium) with the most potential while being the most convenient (delegation, no need to claim every week, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I detail the contributions of Convex, it is obviously to ask the question: what does Bent bring &lt;strong&gt;functionally&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Convex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming option with LP Curve without owning a veCRV even more optimized than Convex, but all the outperformance comes from the BENT emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less restrictive locking of CVX than direct locking via vlCVX (8 weeks at Bent, 16 weeks + 7 days at Convex)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the third element is still missing to make Bent an interesting option, a mechanism that would create a real added value compared to Curve/Convex, in addition to farm optimization and a reduction of constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would be dishonest if I did not add one last point: the security and durability of the protocol. Indeed, Bent Finance has been attacked by an insider in December 2021 for several weeks. The attack was made possible by the fact that at that time, Bent&amp;rsquo;s contracts were not secured by a multisig: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://halborn.com/explained-the-bent-finance-hack-december-2021/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more information here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conic-finance-cnc--collective-liquidity-management-on-curveconvex&#34;&gt;Conic Finance (CNC) 🚧: collective liquidity management on Curve/Convex.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚧 reports a protocol not yet launched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Bent, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ConicFinance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Conic&lt;/a&gt; offers an additional abstraction from Curve LPs staked on Convex. However I think that this time the model has relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic introduces the concept of &amp;ldquo;omnipools&amp;rdquo;, which would simplify the management for Curve LPs by going back to the primitive level: here, it is directly the tokens that are deposited (e.g. USDC or DAI). The Conic omnipools will then distribute the tokens on different LP Curve positions which are then staked on Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depositors receive their CRV, CVX and CNC tokens from Conic. In a similar way to CVX, the CNC can be &amp;ldquo;vote locked&amp;rdquo; to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in bi-weekly gauge votes that determine the distribution of Curve pools by assets accepted on Conic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote on the whitelist and blacklist of accepted Curve pools (and thus eligible for gauges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in the vote to decide which assets are supported on Conic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other governance decisions, including the potential activation of fees for the service (initially there will be none).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conic&amp;rsquo;s approach thus seems relevant and could be described as pooled asset management. It is a model reminiscent of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokemak.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tokemak&lt;/a&gt; and goes one step further than Curve/Convex which remains at the level of governance determination of incitations. Here, governance votes will result in the actual movement of assets between different Curve pools. If the protocol manages to attract sufficient liquidity, it could become a major player in the Curve Wars, potentially with its own bribe system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has just been unveiled and the approach being considered for launch is also interesting. Part of the CNC supply will be airdropped to vlCVX owners. For the rest, it will be distributed with community fundraising, liquidity mining on CNC/ETH and to depositors on Conic. To learn more, there is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ConicFinance/conic-finance-pre-launch-announcement-7b9f485f59f2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only one article available for now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;borrowing-services-with-lp-curveconvex-tokens-as-collateral&#34;&gt;Borrowing services with LP Curve/Convex tokens as collateral
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may start to get saturated just by mentioning a new potential wrapper on CRV, CVX or even cvxCRV: this is probably normal. Most of the protocols involved in the Curve Wars develop synergies directly at the token level, which remains the most direct. But we should not forget two other important types of actors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols offering a synergistic service with the Curve/Convex LP, such as using it as collateral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocols / DAOs that have large amounts of CVX and CRV and can use them to develop a strategic position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going to the whales and their strategies, I offer you two last analyses of protocols that allow you to borrow from an LP Curve position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lendflare-lft&#34;&gt;Lendflare (LFT)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lendflare.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lendflare&lt;/a&gt; allows Curve LPs to borrow from their position an asset that follows the same peg, for example a DAI borrow with the LP 3pool token (USDC/DAI/USDT) as collateral. This limitation avoids liquidations due to price changes between assets: with Lendflare as long as a borrower pays back his debt on or before the due date he is not liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical point, as with any money market, is to attract enough depositors to make borrowing as cheap as possible and therefore competitive. Lendflare follows the logic of Curve&amp;rsquo;s boosts: users who bring in cash (USDC, DAI, ETH or wBTC) to facilitate borrowing are rewarded with the LFT token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on Curve, here they can also benefit from a multiplier of up to 2.5x by locking in a quantity of LFT (veLFT) proportional to the deposit. There is even a very dense diagram that summarizes everything and will make you appreciate the special care I put into my home-made infographics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/lendflare.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;LendFlare&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol is still in the midst of deployment, although the borrowing functionality is already available. An initial sale (IDO) of the LFT token is underway, and an airdrop is also being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curvance-cve-&#34;&gt;Curvance (CVE) 🚧
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curvance tackles the same problem but with a different approach. Here the protocol is not interested in Curve LPs as collateral, but rather &amp;ldquo;wrapped assets&amp;rdquo; in general like cvxCRV, bveCVX (Badger) or yvBOOST (Yearn). To enable the borrowing of stablecoins with these assets as collateral, they plan to isolate the risk by relying on Fuse pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the CVE token will be distributed to liquidity providers and a veCVE-like system is envisioned with a new subtlety: yet another wrap, a liquid version of the veCVE, the cveCVE that gives access to the veCVE&amp;rsquo;s yield but delegates governance capabilities to the DAO. Again, boosts, gauges, and even potentially bribes are envisioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the curious, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.curvance.com/cve/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;documentation is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daos-whales-in-cvx&#34;&gt;DAOs whales in CVX
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish this overview of the Curve/Convex ecosystem, we should not forget to look directly at the tokens - and in particular the DAOs that have large amounts of CRV or CVX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For CRV, there is not yet a clear dashboard summarizing the situation to my knowledge. For CVX on the other hand, there is a site for that: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;Daocvx.com&#34; &gt;daocvx.com&lt;/a&gt;. The protocols we will detail now do not have any synergy built natively with Curve or Convex, but they have a lot of CVX and use them to improve their competitive position in the CRV war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/daocvx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;daocvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you dig through the list on your own, we&amp;rsquo;ll just detail two: Frax and Badger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frax-finance-dominating-the-curve-gauge-game&#34;&gt;Frax Finance: Dominating the Curve Gauge Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frax has a long-standing strategy of dominating the Curve Gauge game to help drive FRAX adoption. It was one of the first DAOs to gain a consistent position in CVX; it is now the DAO with the &lt;strong&gt;largest position with over 2.1M CVX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frax is also known to be the most aggressive project with bribes and frequently offers the largest Votium bribe for its FRAX/3crv pool. In the last round (14), Frax&amp;rsquo;s bribe was about &lt;strong&gt;40% of the total value of all bribes&lt;/strong&gt; paid in that round ($6.5M / $16.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Frax can afford to be so aggressive is that their vlCVX position reduces the effective cost of these bribes: thanks to their own votes, the protocol is able to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x090777069299e6e292363c6131b5cc5b463d598a7f89d3c7207148c0497587f8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recover&lt;/a&gt; a significant portion of the FXS used in each round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this strategy, the FRAX/3CRV pool is able to &lt;strong&gt;maintain a CRV issuance rate almost five times higher than the 3pool, for a similar total liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; (3pool: $3.3B, FRAX: $2.7B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;badger-a-small-corner-for-bitcoin&#34;&gt;Badger: a small corner for Bitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Badger has focused on optimizing farming with BTC on Ethereum. Initially, before Convex, Badger worked closely with Yearn, but with the launch of Convex and its rapid dominance, Badge&amp;rsquo;s position has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Frax, Badger did not buy its CVX. Instead, Badger is developing a model similar to Convex&amp;rsquo;s to accumulate CRV under control; the bveCVX vault. It offers a similar return to direct locking on Convex, but includes itself in the Badger ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bveCVX scales contribute to Badger&amp;rsquo;s internal boost system that is effective on most vaults. In addition, in each round the BadgerDAO uses the corresponding bveCVX voting power to support the Curve pools supported in Badger, which are essentially pools that involve one or more variants of wBTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/curve-wars-l2/bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bvecvx.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than acquiring its position in CVX, Badger is able to obtain control of CVX tokens thanks to incentives - so it&amp;rsquo;s a sort of CVX rental. There is also a Curve bveCVX/CVX pool to allow early exit from the vault. There are now almost 1.7M CVX in the vault, so the strategy has proven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-daos&#34;&gt;Other DAOs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I focused on two projects that develop two very distinct strategies to accumulate CVX and weigh in on the Curve Wars. As you can see on the graph above, there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protocol develops a substantial position on CVX (say &amp;gt;300K CVX), it benefits directly from its tokens, especially in terms of liquidity. Nevertheless it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there: large CVX owners are in a strategic position and will also be courted very soon for different partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already see the mechanics at work, with the discussion around a potential 4pool (USDC/USDT/FRAX/UST), made possible thanks to the combined influences of Frax, Luna, Redacted and Olympus. The CVX protocols-whales thus become interfaces for the Curve Wars, it remains to be seen who will be able to make them the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NFTfi: NFT meets DeFi, liquidity and leverage ensue</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/nftfi-defi-nft/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/nftfi-defi-nft/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nft-defi-infrastructure-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post NFTfi: NFT meets DeFi, liquidity and leverage ensue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance has opened up a world of possibilities: a myriad of previously necessary intermediaries are now supernumerary. Nevertheless, it is intimidating because of its potential complexity and interdisciplinary. In addition to the obvious technical dimension, DeFi also invokes concepts from various disciplines: economics, social sciences, &amp;ldquo;memetics&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, for years now, NFTs have served as a gateway to the decentralized world, demonstrating the benefits of tokenization and disintermediation to a population still not very fond of DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I propose to converge the two main themes of this blog into one captivating topic: the emergence of DeFi infrastructure for NFTs, or the arrival of NFTs/gamification in DeFi - it&amp;rsquo;s all about perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defi--nft--nftfi--a-world-of-possibilities-for-your-jpegs&#34;&gt;DeFi + NFT =&amp;gt; NFTfi : a world of possibilities for your JPEGs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use cases at the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs are numerous and in full development. Rather than an exhaustive list, I propose to analyze a few emblematic projects to understand how they assemble elements from both universes to offer a relevant service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infography is a good starting point to deepen your analysis of the NFTfi landscape if this article arouses your curiosity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftfi-landscape.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftfi-landscape&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the most intuitive one for those who are already a bit up to date with DeFi: the arrival of a financial infrastructure to exchange, but also to lend, to make productive or to split NFTs. To tackle this vast subject, let&amp;rsquo;s start from the first layer: the infrastructure used to buy and sell NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nft-buying-and-selling-services&#34;&gt;NFT buying and selling services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, NFTs were in a strange in-between situation. In essence, NFTs allow disintermediation and more direct interaction between creators and their audience. With this disintermediation comes a massive reduction in the costs incurred to bring a work to market and new possibilities, such as their interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only thing is, NFTs are still exchanged mainly on a service that is not up to their standards, I named OpenSea - which still remains dominant although the situation is changing rapidly since the arrival of LooksRare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, OpenSea has many limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A near-weary fee for each exchange - 2.5% - and that is reserved exclusively for the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic lack of respect for the NFT community: violation of their privacy, manipulation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A certain disregard for the most community-based NFT projects: the verification mechanisms on OpenSea are not very transparent and do not really depend on the volume. Pitiful projects, but carried by celebrities, have been verified quickly while Luchadores, for example, are still waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of investment in its own development: the platform is slow to evolve and does not listen to its users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 100% business approach: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opensea/company_financials&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OpenSea has done 9 fundraisings&lt;/a&gt; so far, and this despite the gargantuan profits they generate via the excessive fees charged: $100M in volume &lt;strong&gt;on 1 day ⇒ $2.5M in the team&amp;rsquo;s pockets&lt;/strong&gt; (- operational fees, but still&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get a situation close to the US ISPs: OpenSea is used by everyone in the NFT world, but also &lt;strong&gt;virtually hated by a significant part of its users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the data which speaks for itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/looksrare-vs-opensea.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;looksrare-vs-opensea&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just looking at volume here. In terms of number of users and transactions OpenSea still dominates. You can find all the data on the super dashboard &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hildobby_&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;from Hildoby&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/hildobby/LooksRare-VS-OpenSea&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LooksRare VS Opensea (Dune Analytics)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us were waiting for a credible alternative, and fortunately it has arrived: LooksRare. The case is worth digging into, but in short LooksRare is the exact opposite of OpenSea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction fees are reduced to 2% and &lt;strong&gt;redistributed entirely&lt;/strong&gt; to LOOKS token stakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LooksRare team is very attentive to the community and in two months of existence, they have already implemented many features requested by their users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LOOKS token has been airdropped to OpenSea users. It can now be obtained by buying or selling NFT on Looksrare: &lt;strong&gt;a direct distribution&lt;/strong&gt; to the users of the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) strategy is implemented by the protocol: a significant part of the liquidity on LOOKS is owned directly by the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol already has nearly $13M in ETH+LOOK deployed on UniswapV3 to support liquidity - here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://debank.com/profile/0xc8c57e4c73c71f72ca0a7e043e5d2d144f98ef13&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LooksRare&amp;rsquo;s wallet&lt;/a&gt; to see for yourself. The fees collected on the LP are used to&amp;hellip; bring more and more liquidity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/looksrare-pol.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;looksrare-pol&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new set of rules allows LooksRare to be extremely competitive compared to Opensea, since the fee is 20% lower, and each purchase/sale is also paid in LOOKS. The result is clear: both buyers and sellers benefit from preferring LooksRare to Opensea.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization-explained-with-nfts-partialization&#34;&gt;Tokenization explained with NFTs partialization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanging NFTs is great: you still need to understand what&amp;rsquo;s in the box! We will therefore detail the stakes of tokenization with several examples. Indeed, the possibilities offered by the latter are immense, so let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the time to explain the concept. Tokenization is the action of creating a token (a token that &lt;strong&gt;represents&lt;/strong&gt; something). At first sight like that, the interest can be hard to conceive. However, tokenizing also allows for a form of &amp;ldquo;alchemy&amp;rdquo;: a transmutation - a change in the type of token from fungible to non-fungible, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example that illustrates the benefits of tokenization - the case of &lt;strong&gt;fractionalizing an NFT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We start with a specific non-fungible token, CryptoPunk #666 for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We lock it in a contract that issues 10 000 PUNK tokens, ERC-20 tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now have a token that represents 1/10,000 of the original CryptoPunk #666. This token is a classic ERC-20 and therefore easily exchangeable via Uniswap or other (⚠️ Liquidity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⇒ Tokenization here allows &lt;strong&gt;collective ownership of a unique asset&lt;/strong&gt; (the NFT CryptoPunk #666).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept, while illustrating the benefits of tokenization also corresponds to a real use case. The reality is of course more complex, since we have only described here the collectivization mechanism (1 NFT ⇒ 10 000 ERC20). The reverse path is also possible to recover access to the locked NFT: 10 000 PUNK ⇒ NFT CryptoPunk #666: this is privatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is the one of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://spectre.xyz/litepaper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Spectrum.xyz&lt;/a&gt;, a service that allows to manage the collectivization and privatization of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/spectre.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;spectre-xyz&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the collective possession, such a solution also has an interest in terms of liquidity: the obtained token (PUNK) is a classic ERC20, it is thus much easier to develop solutions allowing its immediate purchase and sale than with an NFT, which requires the meeting of a simultaneous demand and offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization-to-develop-liquidity-vaults&#34;&gt;Tokenization to develop liquidity: vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once tokenization is well understood, the next chapter - NFT vaults - is almost a given. One of the challenges of NFTs is the liquidity of the markets. Non-fungibility is great for making collections of 10,000 coins, all of which are unique but similar - but what about the valuation and exchange of these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides LooksRare and Opensea mentioned above, there are other marketplaces for NFTs that rely on a different logic: this is &lt;strong&gt;the NFT vault model&lt;/strong&gt; - which has many interests, but also limitations - the main one being that this approach is only possible with large collections (several hundred units) and/or quite popular (high demand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[MINT] A &amp;ldquo;vault&amp;rdquo; (smart contract) specific to a collection is created; users can deposit their NFTs in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user deposits an NFT in the vault, its contribution is recognized by the emission of an ERC20 token.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠️ As you can see, the vault assumes that all NFTs are equivalent: so it is better to enter a vault with an NFT among the least rare of the given collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader in this field is probably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nftx.io/vault/0x87931e7ad81914e7898d07c68f145fc0a553d8fb/info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFTX&lt;/a&gt;, but there is also &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nft20.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFT20&lt;/a&gt;. This method allows you to get an ERC20 token - for example the WIZARD - that corresponds to a claim on any NFT in the vault, in this case any of the 215 Forgotten Wizard Cult (NFTs) contained in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nftx.io/vault/0x87931e7ad81914e7898d07c68f145fc0a553d8fb/info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the vault.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftx-wizard-list.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftx-wizard-list&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity on the WIZARD token can be developed against ETH for example, allowing the immediate purchase of any wizard contained in the vault. The reverse is also possible: any owner of a Forgotten Wizard Cult can deposit it in the vault in order to obtain 1 WIZARD which he can then sell for ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally NFTX goes even further since the platform&amp;rsquo;s native token as well as the collected fees are used to offer incentives to deṕoser in the vault and develop liquidity. &lt;strong&gt;Users who&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;deposit NFTs into the vault are thus eligible for a staking fee&lt;/strong&gt; - and higher returns are possible for those who deposit + LP: the financialization of NFTs is launched!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/nftx-wizard.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nftx-wizard&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus here is on liquidity, but keep in mind that switching from an NFT to an ERC-20 comes with many other benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the liquidity on the pair is sufficient - then it also becomes &lt;strong&gt;a price source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price source (oracle) + liquidity means&amp;hellip; collateral of course! With these two elements, there is nothing to prevent the WIZARD from being considered as &lt;strong&gt;collateral for borrowing&lt;/strong&gt; other tokens like stablecoins. This is feasible but much more complex starting directly from the NFT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, keep in mind that there is no limit to tokenization, as long as there is an interest. We stayed here on single tokenization cases, but &lt;strong&gt;tangled tokenization&lt;/strong&gt; scenarios are also possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ERC-20 token that represents a claim on a given Wizard is great. Now imagine that you have the same thing for CryptoPunks, BAYC and so on - this is the case on NFTX. There is nothing to prevent us from considering an additional tokenization step to create an &lt;strong&gt;NFT index&lt;/strong&gt; represented by an ERC20 token but which would itself &lt;strong&gt;be exchangeable against the tokens representing the underlying assets:&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could thus imagine the NFT-Bluechip-Index, an ERC-20 token created by locking 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC. This token would be easily liquid, and thus allow for easy exposure to all three collections in a single transaction. In addition, the token would remain fully collateralized at all times by 1 NFT from each collection. An owner of the NFT-Bluechip-Index could do the opposite at any time, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[With the NFT-Bluechip contract] : burn 1 NFT-Bluechip-Index to get 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Using NFTX contracts/vaults] burn of 1 WIZARD + 1 PUNK + 1 BAYC to retrieve one NFT (of your choice from those in the vault) from each underlying collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;idol--ntfs-to-tokenize-a-defi-yield&#34;&gt;Idol : NTFs to tokenize a DeFi yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue and finish on tokenization, know that it also allows to link the two worlds - NFTs and DeFi: the perfect example here is the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theidols.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IdolsNFT&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IdolsNFT were initially sold via a bonding curve for a price between 0.25 and 0.5 ETH. All ETH collected during the sale are staked via Lido (StETH). Owning an Idol makes you eligible for the corresponding share of the returns. Here, it is the yield generated by the StETH that is tokenized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/idol-nfts.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;idols-nft&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the project goes even further! Indeed, there is also an ERC-20 in the story, the VIRTUE, initially distributed to the first buyers. From now on, to obtain VIRTUE, it is necessary to bond stETH (-&amp;gt; which increases the productive capital of the project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIRTUE corresponds to a proxy exposure on NFT Idols: for each sale of an NFT Idol, a fee of 7.5% is taken and given to the VIRTUE stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/idol-cycle.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;idolnfts-virtue-cycle&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Idols, &amp;ldquo;Guardians of Ethereum&amp;rdquo; use NFTs to make ETH staking more fun and interactive. In addition, the capture of fees on the VIRTUE token allows to avoid an &amp;ldquo;external capture&amp;rdquo; of fees generated by IdolsNFT exchanges as it is the case for NFTs exchanged on NFTX for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the large owners of the collection have a clear path to compound their return if their conviction is strong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possession of several IdolsNFT ⇒ Yield in stETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composition of farmed stETH via bonding ⇒ VIRTUE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake of VIRTUE ⇒ Yield in ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staking ETH with Lido ⇒ StETH ⇒ Bonding for VIRTUE then stake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens with this collection, I think it has laid the foundation for what NFTs collections augmented by and synergistic with DeFi can be. I expect to see many more relevant variations on this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggregation-of-various-liquidity-sources&#34;&gt;Aggregation of various liquidity sources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have already mentioned three different platforms to buy or sell NFTs: OpenSea, LooksRare and NFTX. The reality is even denser, there is an armada of marketplaces for NFTs, more or less successful and more or less specialized, here are some others: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://superrare.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Superrare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://foundation.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nft20.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NFT20&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with this myriad of options, buyers do not necessarily have the time, inclination, energy or knowledge to explore all their options before concluding a transaction. The situation is very similar to buying/selling an ERC20 token in DeFi: liquidity is very fragmented. Logically, the solution is therefore similar to the one deployed in DeFi: aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/gem-xyz.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gem.xyz&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there are several services capable of directing &amp;ldquo;orders&amp;rdquo; to different marketplaces, or even ŕealising a &amp;ldquo;swipe&amp;rdquo; across multiple platforms with a single transaction: these are &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://genie.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gem.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, it is the responsiveness of the team and the composability of the service that will make the difference in the long run: Gem seems to be ahead of the game thanks to its advanced integration of LooksRare (claim LOOKS possible for buyers via Gem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nft--defi--games-with-real-stakes&#34;&gt;NFT + DeFi =&amp;gt; Games with real stakes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If DeFi has discovered the huge market that is NFTs recently, the reverse march is also observed: &lt;strong&gt;the arrival of DeFi components in NFTs projects&lt;/strong&gt; - we often talk about GameFi to describe this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been several years since the first iterations of GameFi appeared, with games that can become a credible source of income for their players: the most famous is of course &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://axieinfinity.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, but there are many others: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.aavegotchi.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AaveGotchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cryptoraiders.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CryptoRaiders&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not very active on these projects myself, so I propose to detail one that is more familiar to me: Luchadores. Here again, we find DeFi components that are grafted on the NFT project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a Luchador (NFT) gives the right to a return in LUCHA (ERC20 token).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol owns about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://debank.com/profile/0x0cb11b92fa5c30eafe4ae84b7bb4df3034c38b9d&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;60% of the liquidity on the two LUCHA pairs&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the funds raised during the sale of the first pinatas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 🪅 are ERC-1155 tokens that contain 1 accessory for Luchadores, whose rarity is determined by verifiable randomness (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.chain.link/vrf-v2-mainnet-launch/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chainlink VRF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol also has about 30 Luchadores (⇒Yield in LUCHA) purchased with part of the profits from the first pinata: the purchase was made using an aggregator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A marketplace is available for accessories, with payment in LUCHA: a redistribution of the collected fees is also possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/luchadores.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is not yet available (Alpha by the end of March!), but interactions of this type will only become more dense as it develops. With the arrival of the game, new features will come: staking your LUCHA tokens will allow you to get MASK, a non-transferable token but necessary to buy different items to increase the power of your Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the launch of the game, players will earn LUCHA for each victory. Depending on their ranking, the amount of LUCHA obtained increases: the best players will be able to get interesting returns, for a very moderate initial cost (1 Luchador, potentially minted for ~0.03 ETH). Be prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you discover Luchadores with this article, feel free to read this introduction: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/luchadores-nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🤼 Long live free (and verifiable onchain) wrestling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have stayed on the visible part of the iceberg. At the crossroads of DeFi and NFTs, there are still many new possible use cases. I propose to make a list with the main services that explore these fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;floordao--nft-x-defi-x-dao&#34;&gt;FloorDAO : NFT x DeFi x DAO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://floor.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FloorDAO&lt;/a&gt; is sort of an extra layer built on top of NFTX. FloorDAO uses the OlympusDAO model but adapted for NFTs. The objective is to ensure a return and support liquidity on the collections concerned (Punk and Wizard for the moment). How does it work? Simple: for the concerned collections, the owners of the corresponding NFTX token (ex WIZARD for Forgotten Wizards) as well as the LP (WIZARD/ETH) can bond it to obtain FLOOR tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/nft-defi-infrastructure/floordao-bond.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;floordao-bond&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collected tokens and LPs are used by FloorDAO to generate a return (NFTX staking). The community (gFLOOR holders) votes to decide which assets to acquire next. Olympus uses the inflation of its governance token to acquire strategic assets such as DAI, LUSD, or CRV; FloorDAO does the same thing but targets NFTX tokens and therefore backs them with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, the protocol owns a share of its own liquidity on FLOOR/ETH (on Uniswap) and the fees generated by the position contribute to the returns of the FloorDAO treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nfts-to-collateralize-loans-without-going-through-an-erc20vault&#34;&gt;NFTs to collateralize loans (without going through an ERC20/vault)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main limitation to overcome here is of course the fact that the sale of NFT is done in a bid/ask logic and is therefore not immediate. Several projects are nevertheless tackling the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://drops.co&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/defi-vs-inflation-tokenbrice-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to build an inflation-proof DeFi portfolio?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation is more than ever at the center of discussions and concerns: no one understands much about it, no economist has really anticipated it, but we all have an opinion about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we leave economics and politics aside to focus on what matters for your wallet: in decentralized finance, all kinds of protocols are developed, and a good part of them &lt;strong&gt;provide credible and innovative tools to preserve and develop the purchasing power of a portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;, even when the macroeconomic context is most uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to evaluate strategies involving different assets and protocols, all with the same goal: to preserve and develop the effective purchasing power of a given portfolio. Nevertheless, we have to start with the basics, level 0: what is inflation and why should we, DeFians, care about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover image was made by a generous anonymous contributor and features the majestic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/valkyre/created&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Valkyr-E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;α-tutorial-understanding-the-impact-of-inflation-on-a-crypto-portfolio&#34;&gt;α/ Tutorial: Understanding the impact of inflation on a crypto portfolio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t venture into the details of inflation for fiat currencies here, but the basic concept is known to anyone familiar with cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the term: here is how the INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques) defines inflation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is the loss of purchasing power of money that results in a general and lasting increase in prices. It must be distinguished from the increase in the cost of living. The loss of value of money is a phenomenon that hits the national economy as a whole (households, businesses, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just remember that, &lt;strong&gt;just like in DeFi where each token is associated with a protocol and potentially even an ecosystem, each fiat currency is also based on an economy as well as a set of rules&lt;/strong&gt; (legal system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inflation-macro-point-of-view-scale--country&#34;&gt;Inflation, macro point of view (scale = country)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation corresponds to the production of new money, the important thing is not so much the quantity of money created, but more &lt;strong&gt;what is done with&lt;/strong&gt;. We all understand this rather well with two caricatural examples at each extreme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central bank of country A issues a large amount of money in order to invest massively in its transport infrastructure and its energy supply (= long-term investments).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, inflation can be controlled because the new money issued is used to finance investments that develop the country&amp;rsquo;s economic potential in the long run (-&amp;gt; compensation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central bank of country B issues a large amount of money to finance an emergency plan to compensate for the foreseeable consequences of previous pseudo-sanitary measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this second scenario, the new money is used to cover a &amp;ldquo;current expense&amp;rdquo; of the government. The personal equivalent would be to go into debt every day to pay for lunch. This is obviously unsustainable in the long run. In this scenario, inflation can only be massive as a large amount of new money is issued, while the economic potential of the country in question stagnates or deteriorates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluating-future-inflation&#34;&gt;Evaluating future inflation?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough about the macro, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to our scale, with things we know well. Here is the evolution of the M1 money supply on the dollar, this allows us to visualize its &amp;ldquo;marketcap&amp;rdquo; in a way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/USD-m1-supply.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;USD M1 Supply&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we only look at M1 for simplicity but the trend is similar on M2 and M3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested here in the dollar which, although challenged, remains the fiduciary currency that sets the tone. As you can see, the curve has been going vertical since the beginning of the Covid crisis. The curve is now much scarier than the worst shitcoins I have ever seen. Doubt it? Consider the same information, presented in this light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dollar has been around since 1914. 20% of all dollars in circulation were created in 2020. At the current rate, the total amount of dollars in circulation doubles about every 4-5 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare with crypto, many are concerned about inflation / new token issuance on Curve Finance (CRV). The 4 year issuance curve looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/crv-release-schedule.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;crv-release-schedule&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no economist, but I know my shitcoins. The official US inflation figure we are given is 7.5% per year. Like unemployment figures, it&amp;rsquo;s a highly political metric that&amp;rsquo;s hard to really appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7.5% figure may seem high, but it is still low when compared to the unprecedented money creation to deal with Covid. So I expect to see this inflation rise further, or else to be sustained over an extended period of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So inflation is here, at 7.5% minimum for several years at least. Enough with boomers&amp;rsquo; macro, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the range of tools that the DeFi offers us to face it and overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-beating-inflation-with-classic-stablecoin-returns&#34;&gt;I/ Beating inflation with &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; stablecoin returns
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first approach is as always the simplest, &lt;strong&gt;the brute force method&lt;/strong&gt;: an inflation of 7.5% means that USD left as is will lose 7.5% of their value over the year. The point here is to find a source of return higher than inflation: the difference between the two is the effective return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With inflation at 7.5% on the USD, I think it is prudent to make sure to &lt;strong&gt;reach at least 1.5x this figure in yield&lt;/strong&gt; to really consider yourself inflation-proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the game is simple and the rules fairly easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You start with a position in a given stablecoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal is to make it productive, without assuming IL risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a return that exceeds the inflation figure, once the gas costs have been amortized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-stablecoin-deposit&#34;&gt;Simple stablecoin deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we would aim for &lt;strong&gt;a 10.875% annual return on stablecoin $ at the very least&lt;/strong&gt;. With recent declines and yield compression this is increasingly difficult, but still findable even with a single stablecoin deposit without IL risk. Tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://coindix.com/?kind=stable&amp;amp;sort=-apy&amp;amp;chain=ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Coindix&lt;/a&gt; can help you find the vault of your dreams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/coindix.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;coindix&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful though, &lt;strong&gt;not all vaults are created equal&lt;/strong&gt;! For example, we see nice returns on Bancor on the screenshot: don&amp;rsquo;t forget to consider the volatility of these returns as well as the fees in gas to deploy the position (a Bancor LP is notoriously more expensive than a Yearn deposit for example).&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Anchor protocol&lt;/a&gt; also offers you a &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; return close to 20% on UST stablecoin. Such a guaranteed rate does not come, of course, without serious compromises that raise real questions about the sustainability of this whole ecosystem (Terra/Luna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;provision-of-liquidity--time-commitment&#34;&gt;Provision of liquidity + time commitment
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in dollars, but a bit riskier, we can consider different types of commitments, with very controlled / no IL risks. For example, a liquidity provision between FRAX and DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/frax-dai.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;FRAX/DAI LP opportunities on Frax&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://frax.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frax Finance&lt;/a&gt;, the prime rate (x1) is just our minimum target, but it is possible to reach up to x5 with two types of commitment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X3 by locking LP tokens for 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X2 by using your veFXS (much harder to reach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective return on a position locked in for three years corresponds to about 3 times our minimum target, thus offering a credible protection against the loss of value due to the consequences of inflation, but you still have to be able to assume the three-year commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example is taken here on DAI, but the situation is similar on the other major stablecoins; for example, here are the FRAX/USDC pools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/frax-usdc.png&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenizing-and-speculating-on-future-yields&#34;&gt;Tokenizing and speculating on future yields
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To beat that famous 10% return on the dollar, there are still many other options. I present you one last one here to help you consider the other possible strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this one, we rely on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that allows the tokenization of future yields on productive assets. The principle is both simple and complex: depositing an asset on APWine allows to separate its future yield (FYT: Future Yield Token) from the underlying principal (PT: Principal Token).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, different strategies are possible, such as immediately selling the future yield (FYT) in order to increase the quantity of the productive principal. Such a tool enables better risk management considering the volatily of yields observed in DeFi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s keep it simple and still well above the 10% requirement: let&amp;rsquo;s zoom in on the aUSDT vault of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/apwine-USDT-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;APWine aUSDT vault&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I automatically exclude the PT/FYT pool which is more complex to understand and has much higher risks than the PT/Underlying offering a 44% return in APW anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the strategy is simple, but you have to &lt;strong&gt;keep in mind the important gas costs linked to the use of APWine&lt;/strong&gt;. To implement the strategy using USDT in the wallet, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Deposit a part of them on Aave (I&amp;rsquo;d recommend 55% of the total maximum for this specific strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Deposit the aUSDT obtained in 1 on APWine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow (x2) + Deposit the PT and Underlying (USDT) tokens as liquidity providing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow + Stake of the LPs PT/Underlying tokens to obtain the return in APW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget also the gas fees related to the APW claims + unwinding of the position at the end of the period (or before).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore better to wait for a day when the transactions clear under 30 gwei so as not to suffer too much from the gas costs on such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage here, compared to Frax for example, is that &lt;strong&gt;the position is much more liquid&lt;/strong&gt;. APWine works with an epoch logic that lasts 90 days. Thus, to more easily amortize the costs in gas it is preferable to deploy the strategy at the beginning of the epoch: this is also when the returns are generally the highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third winelisting (where the next tokens supported on APWine are decided) has just ended, so don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to prepare for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/apw-winelisting3.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;APWine - Winelisting 3&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APWine is still a young protocol, but the governance is dynamic. The next step is approaching: as on Curve, it will soon be the veAPW holders (locked APW) that &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.apwine.fi/t/apgp-2-enable-gauges-for-apw-rewards/171&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;will decide on emissions&lt;/a&gt; for each given vault. A redistribution of the cards is to be expected, plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-hedged-productive-positions-with-various-alternative-stablecoins&#34;&gt;II/ Hedged productive positions with various &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; stablecoins
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have stayed for now on the dollar, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to begin with. Although dollar stablecoins are still largely dominant, there are now &lt;strong&gt;many stablecoins based on other fiat currencies&lt;/strong&gt; such as EUR, JPY (Japanese Yen), CHF (Swiss Franc), KRW (Korean Won) or even CAD (Canadian Dollar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the few centralized stablecoins (EURS or EURT), this market is mostly covered by protocols that offer to create synthetic stablecoins backed by other stablecoins. This is the case for example with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jarvis.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jarvis Network&lt;/a&gt;, which uses USDC to collateralize different types of stablecoins: jEUR, jCHF, jKRW, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;single-deposit&#34;&gt;Single deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yield opportunities with no/low IL for such stablecoins are still quite rare, and usually found on Curve: providing liquidity against other stablecoins based on the same fiat currency, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/curve-chf.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;CHF pool on Curve Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few stablecoins have lucrative single deposit options jEUR, jCHF, jJPY. They are based on the corresponding Curve pools, with additional incentives offered by Jarvis and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Jarvis (also available farmed by Harvest), it is also possible to generate a return without IL on jCAD and jJPY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiatafiatb-liquidity-providing&#34;&gt;FiatA/FiatB Liquidity Providing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a slightly different approach, more risky, but also potentially more protective against inflation: providing liquidity on two stablecoins representing two different fiat currencies, for example EURT/3pool (USD) still on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, especially for smaller portfolios, many alternative stablecoins are available on Polygon or Avalanche, with a fairly dense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarvis offers jCHF-USDC, jEUR-USDC or jCAD-USDC pools with returns above 20%. Tools like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://beefy.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Beefy.Finance&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to automatically compose the returns obtained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/harvest-jarvis-2-stables.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Harvest Network Jarvis jFIAT&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: depending on your base asset (e.g. USDC), exposure to EUR (or other currencies) can be lucrative or costly - depending on the evolution of the USDC/EUR exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the more adventurous among you, you should know that APWine is also available on Polygon and already supports several Jarvis tokens, such as the MooJarvis_4eur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity contribution on Curve (4eur)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed by Beefy Finance (moo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which compounds return that Jarvis offers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the addition of tokens voted during winelisting 3 will open new doors with the upcoming arrival on APWine/Polygon of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooKyber_USDC-jEUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MooMai_USDC-MAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forex-borrowing&#34;&gt;Forex Borrowing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if liquidations don&amp;rsquo;t scare you, know that a Fuse pool on Polygon (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pool7 - Jarvis Forex Market&lt;/a&gt;) allows you to use different jFiat as collateral as well as to borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/fuse-pool7.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Fuse pool 7&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a service, almost anything is possible, here are some examples to inspire you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long USD + short EUR = MAI in collateral, borrow jEUR then sell jEUR and potentially loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short GBP via CHF = jCHF in collateral, borrow jGBP then sell and potential loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also note that the productive stablecoins m2CAD and m2JPY are available as collateral while keeping their yield: they can be interesting for more traditional leverage strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-your-balance&#34;&gt;Finding your balance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just one magic position, what I like about Jarvis stablecoins is the ability to &lt;strong&gt;diversify easily into different types of fiat currencies&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to the low transaction fees on Polygon, it is quite possible to mix several different currencies and positions to make a coherent whole and well protected against its local inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for a European (= spending €):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% in stable productive € without IL, for example MooJarvis_4eur (+APWine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% in jEUR/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% in stable productive dollar (e.g. aUSDT APWine strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp; Diversification: 15% jCHF/USDC + 15% jGBP/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while we&amp;rsquo;re on the subject of &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; stablecoins, you should know that there are also a few that track gold or silver - they can be relevant from this perspective too. For example XAUT (with Pool Curve XAUT/3crv). Gold and silver remain &lt;del&gt;barbaric&lt;/del&gt; boomers&amp;rsquo; relics, personally I see very little interest in them for a competent DeFian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-inflation-resistant-stablecoins&#34;&gt;III/ Inflation resistant stablecoins
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beating inflation is nice. Hedging it? Even better. But &lt;strong&gt;why not just abstract it&lt;/strong&gt;, using products that are naturally resistant to it? There are still very few stablecoins that are not tracking fiat currencies, but the supply is growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-the-first-dollar-free-stablecoin&#34;&gt;RAI, the first dollar-free stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a strange beast, the very first &amp;ldquo;unpegged stablecoin.&amp;rdquo; Launched at a value of Pi in USD (3.14) in 2021, it has been moving between 3.02 and 3.06 almost since its launch. Given its recent arrival (just over a year), it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how RAI will perform in a period of prolonged inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, diversifying a portion of your stablecoins into RAI may be an attractive option. In addition, there are different return options available on RAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple deposit without IL risk: Idle Finance deposits your RAI in Fuse/Aave to optimize the native return + incentives in FLX from Reflexer + incentives in IDLE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2022/defi-vs-inflation/rai-idle-0.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Additional FLX incentives for RAI on Idle Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By assuming IL risk via liquidity provision on Curve vs. 3pool, a better return is possible. The crvRAI can then be staked directly on Curve or via Convex or Yearn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAI is based on a mechanism inspired by Maker MCD but with many modifications to make it possible. To understand how it works, I invite you to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/reflexer-rai/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my dedicated article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚧 Signals that the mentioned protocol is still under development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;-an-inflation-resistant-stablecoin-the-frax-fpi&#34;&gt;🚧 An inflation-resistant stablecoin? The FRAX FPI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frax Price Index is a new protocol that should arrive soon within the Frax ecosystem. The goal is to offer a new stablecoin, which would follow the CPI (Consumer Price Index) to protect against inflation. Just like Frax, &lt;strong&gt;the system is based on two tokens&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stable - Frax Price Index (FPI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the governance token - Frax Price Index Share (FPIS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.frax.finance/frax-price-index/inflation-hedge&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frax documentation&lt;/a&gt; offers some information about the upcoming token. &lt;strong&gt;An airdrop of FPIS is planned&lt;/strong&gt; for veFXS or cvxFXS holders. Thus, the protocol will be independent of FRAX/FXS, although a value capture mechanism to FXS is planned beyond the initial airdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to project solely on a mere design, but it is clear that a stablecoin that would maintain its value despite inflation is a very desirable product. &lt;strong&gt;There are several questions as to whether the peg on FPI can be maintained&lt;/strong&gt;: to keep its equilibrium, people will have to take the opposite trade to FPI, i.e. &amp;ldquo;short inflation&amp;rdquo;. However, in the current context of galloping inflation, it is hard to imagine who could assume such a position and massive incentives might be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the arrival of the FPI is imminent. Traces of the token &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb68c6264e9d0f8a6df1fa5a89f205da38698d15&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FPIS on EtherScan&lt;/a&gt; can be found as early as early March. I look forward to seeing the Frax team&amp;rsquo;s proposed design to address these consequential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-inflation-resistance--degen--volt&#34;&gt;🚧 Inflation resistance + degen = VOLT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Frax&amp;rsquo;s FPI, there is another project I&amp;rsquo;ve been following closely, waiting for a long time and holding high hopes for. The high-level concept is very simple: an Abracadabra-like product that would not be a walking security loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Abracadabra allows borrowing from various productive collaterals, which makes the service desirable. Nevertheless, the infrastructure is close to a hack and the actions of the team members make Abracadabra a second or third grade money market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here, with Volt, is to cover the same vertical using a proven infrastructure: the base offered by Reflexer (RAI). Three main changes are expected on this model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike Reflexer, which only accepts ETH as collateral, Volt will diversify the available options, notably with productive collateral such as wstETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of VOLT, the system&amp;rsquo;s stablecoin, will be indexed to Frax&amp;rsquo;s FPI. The Reflexer infrastructure will be reused (PID controller adapted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Volt team is also working in collaboration with Fuse and Olympus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow Volt, as always, the alpha lives on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/dGhvDmCNGr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

The vision of creating a borrowing service with an inflation-proof stablecoin remains, but the technical choices have evolved. Read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/volt-protocol/whitepaper/blob/main/volt.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the whitepaper available here&lt;/a&gt; for the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-beating-inflation-with-returns-on-volatile-assets&#34;&gt;IV/ Beating inflation with returns on volatile assets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a world where nothing holds and value leaks, what&amp;rsquo;s left? How about good, proven DeFi assets backed by protocols with massive, recurring revenues shared directly with their holders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few of them, very few. We will detail them one by one, as well as the different options available on them to produce a return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth-the-origin-and-the-end&#34;&gt;ETH: the origin and the end
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is of course ETH, which has many different sources of return - just like stablecoins, there is nothing to stop you from diversifying your ETH exposure with several sources of return, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH staked with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lido.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lido Finance &lt;/a&gt;(low yield, but a priori the safest) [~5%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LP &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rocketpool.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;rETH&lt;/a&gt; on Curve (more innovative, more lucrative, more risky) [~10%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vault covered call options on ETH via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Stakedao&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ribbon.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ribbon Finance&lt;/a&gt; [~25%, risks!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-chain liquidity on a Bridge, for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cbridge.celer.network/#/liquidity&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Celer&lt;/a&gt; [~10%]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A position balanced in this way tracks/exceeds inflation slightly with the returns obtained on ETH. The profitability of the position over the long term depends of course mainly on the average entry price on ETH and its evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crv-cvx-and-fxs-the-three-fates-of-the-defi&#34;&gt;CRV, CVX, and FXS: The three Fates of the DeFi?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Romans, the Fates are three goddesses who govern the lives of humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clotho weaves the thread of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lachesis unwinds it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atropos cuts it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi also knows these Fates: three protocols that play a critical role in the survival and growth of potentially any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in addition to ETH, there are several DeFi projects that have already proven themselves, control substantial revenue streams, and offer a truly relevant service in a macro context of prolonged inflation; I see three essentially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve Finance - CRV&lt;/strong&gt;: the mother of all yields in DeFi + peg machine and liquidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convex Finance - CVX&lt;/strong&gt;: an option on CRV, which controls almost 50% of all locked CRVs and adds real value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frax Finance - FXS&lt;/strong&gt;: innovative stable project, native DeFi, very productive via AMOs + arrival of FPI + Frax has a big position on CVX &amp;amp; some other protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being tokens backed by key protocols in DeFi, there is no shortage of return options on these three tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV -&amp;gt; Deposit on Convex in CvxCRV then stake or LP cvxCRV/CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVX -&amp;gt; Locked vote on Convex in vlCVX -&amp;gt; Return in cvxCRV + bribes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FXS -&amp;gt; Direct deposit on Frax (veFXS) or management via Convex (cvxFXS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-promising-tokens&#34;&gt;Other promising tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are still other projects that have not yet reached the profitability of Curve or Convex but represent credible bets. In a world where inflation is here to stay, the tools that will allow us to protect ourselves from it can become very popular: I propose you some other theses related to what has been already mentioned in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;apwinefi-apw-betting-on-the-advanced-defi-infrastructure&#34;&gt;APWine.fi (APW): betting on the advanced DeFi infrastructure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inflation goes up, everyone is looking for yield. Let them run behind the %, and instead target the pick sellers in this gold rush. This is the main thesis behind a bet on APW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you could see in the article already, APWine offers interesting products to bet on the evolution of yields or even realize a future yield immediately. As DeFi develops, the demand for a product like APWine will keep growing. Will it be APWine, or another one? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the APWine Wars coming up, it&amp;rsquo;s not a stretch to envision bribes similar to what we see on Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reflexer-flx-a-bet-on-degovernance&#34;&gt;Reflexer (FLX): a bet on degovernance
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the very interesting technical approach, Reflexer also innovates on another level. Indeed, since the launch of the protocol, the team has presented a &amp;ldquo;De-governance Plan&amp;rdquo; aiming at progressively minimizing the team&amp;rsquo;s control over the protocol through two main means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation of everything that can be automated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management by FLX holders for situations still requiring manual analysis/decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;strong&gt;Reflexer now exceeds RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. The Money God League is a set of projects building using the Reflexer infrastructure, with the support of the team. So it seems quite natural to consider an airdrop of the governance token of these new projects, including VOLT, to FLX holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last tip: the stakers of the FLX/ETH LP in the Reflexer Safety Module are the last resort to guarantee the solvency of the protocol. If I were to consider an airdrop to thank the Reflexer community, I would probably target them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;looksrare-looks-bet-on-nfts&#34;&gt;LooksRare (LOOKS): bet on NFTs
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of LOOKS as an option on the NFT market. In fact, LooksRare is the first NFT marketplace that shares revenue. This translates into &lt;strong&gt;an ETH yield for stakers on LOOKS that reached 3 digits sustained during the first few weeks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, trading volume has dropped and the ETH yield with it, but &lt;strong&gt;the staking LOOKS is still one of the biggest ETH yields out there&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll stop with these three suggestions, but of course there are other options - you be the judge. For example, the QI Wars have started and the protocol has good traction. Be careful, however, not to fall into the trap of thinking that all protocols that adopt the ve + bribes model will be as successful as Curve and Convex. ve tokenomics will multiply: it&amp;rsquo;s about making the right choices!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🎲 PoolTogether: The story of the no-loss lottery where everyone wins</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/pool-together/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/pool-together/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/cover-EN.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎲 PoolTogether: The story of the no-loss lottery where everyone wins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has enabled the emergence of an alternative financial system built on fundamentally different foundations: transparency, open-source, composability and resistance to censorship. Many use cases have emerged and it is now possible to buy and exchange tokens without a centralized intermediary, but also to lend or borrow and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of the day, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/pool-together-v5/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt;, goes one step further: it uses and assembles different DeFi services to offer a new kind of &amp;ldquo;money game&amp;rdquo;, which is more fun, but also more instructive and much less dangerous and harmful than its classic counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer you to explore this protocol in detail: we start with its context, before analyzing how it works and the different issues it involves. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context-limits-and-dangers-of-the-classic-lottery&#34;&gt;The context: limits and dangers of the classic lottery
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter is almost hard for me to write because it is seems so obvious, yet it is still very poorly perceived by the majority of people. Concretely from a societal point of view, the lottery is probably as deleterious as smoking. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By its design (possible and promoted jackpot), the &lt;strong&gt;lottery targets the most vulnerable populations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite this, the &lt;strong&gt;expectation of winning is negative&lt;/strong&gt;: players lose money while playing for most of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also &lt;strong&gt;serious consequences for the winners&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a complex experience and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/lottery-winners-lost-everything-2017-8?IR=T&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many end up broke after a few years&lt;/a&gt;. Regular gamblers also suffer from addiction problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lottery was wildly taxed and owned by the state&amp;hellip; until now. &lt;strong&gt;Privatization means giving the profits from an activity that is clearly harmful to society to private companies&lt;/strong&gt; - the comparison with smoking makes even more sense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, and this is not specific to the lottery but &lt;strong&gt;equally miserable, denounceable and pitiful&lt;/strong&gt;: gambling often targets the most vulnerable populations for their advertising and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/children-more-likely-to-become-gamblers-due-to-high-volume-of-betting-ads&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;and particularly on young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/winamax-pub.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;winamax-pub&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a look on the full film advertisement created by TBWA, France for Winamax &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/film/winamax_the_mama&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;addictions-dependencies-consequences&#34;&gt;Addictions, dependencies: consequences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is logical, mechanical and despairing: in the long term trend, bets are exploding despite a declining number of players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/evolution-2007-2017.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;stats-fdj&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject is complex and, like smoking, often documented and researched by the gambling service providers themselves. The numbers speak for themselves, however: about 17% of gamblers are potentially at risk of addiction or dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/addictions.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;addictions&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;In 2017, Internet gambling (lottery games, horse or sports betting and poker) accounted for 11.2% of total spending, a share that has been steadily increasing since its authorization in 2010&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; according to the French Observatory of Drugs and Addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other statistics are simply hopeless but ultimately understandable: &lt;strong&gt;the more social and economic misery increases, the more the promise of the lottery jackpot attracts the gullible&lt;/strong&gt;, thus increasing the privatized winnings of the FDJ (the operator of France&amp;rsquo;s national lottery games) and others, and destroying the social fabric ever more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll stop here, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have understood: when you get out of the studies financed by the FDJ or associated, you quickly realize the extent of the social break that the lottery causes. The 22.7% returned to the communities is clearly not enough to compensate the real costs of this &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; (ruined lives, addictions, suicides, broken families, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;promotion-of-a-deleterious-social-novel&#34;&gt;Promotion of a deleterious social novel?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to finish this picture that sets the context, I propose a last more subjective point: what about the impact of the lottery on the &lt;strong&gt;social novel&lt;/strong&gt;? The social novel is like the American dream: a fable that constitutes one of the foundations of the construction of the national identity (in this case: everyone can succeed in the US if they work hard enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a real collective delusion, but it contributes to &lt;strong&gt;defining the imaginary associated with success in a given society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me ask the question: what impact does the lottery have on our social novel? Again it is rather negative I think, because it feeds the fable that to be successful you have to be born into a good family, or &amp;ldquo;lucky&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; become a celebrity / play high level sports or lottery. &lt;strong&gt;The classic lottery thus feeds the emptiness of our contemporary aspirations:&lt;/strong&gt; one more factor contributing to the ambient mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we are done with that. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the heart of the matter and see how PoolTogether reshuffles the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basics-to-understand-the-concept&#34;&gt;The basics to understand the concept
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principle of PoolTogether is basically quite simple, but there are also many details and subtleties that need to be figured out to really understand what the protocol aims to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, there are different sources of return, for example a USDC owner, a stablecoin, can lend it to others to generate a return via a service like Aave or Compound. &lt;strong&gt;Basically, PoolTogether is a playful abstraction layer built on top of such a source of returns.&lt;/strong&gt; At a high level, it looks like something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players deposit USDC into the USDC pool on PoolTogether - and receive a corresponding token to recognize their deposit (PTaUSDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pool (set of smart contracts) deploys the assets in different strategies to produce a return. The return is collected and used to fund the winners&amp;rsquo; prize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each USDC deposited in the pool (⇒ PTaUSDC) corresponds to a potential winning lottery ticket. Every day, an auditable random draw (ChainLink VRF) is held to determine the many winners, with 3 initial prize ranges: 10 PTaUSDC, 100 PTaUSDC or 2500 PTaUSDC jackpot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s this infrastructure that produces a return - and puts only the return into play that qualifies Pool Together as a &lt;strong&gt;no-loss&lt;/strong&gt; lottery. At any time, &lt;strong&gt;the player can stop playing: he will get back at least his initial committed capital&lt;/strong&gt;, if he has never won the lottery, or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to be very precise, the only cost of Pool Together is the &amp;ldquo;opportunity cost of capital&amp;rdquo;: the potential lost opportunity on the mobilized capital, which could theoretically produce a better return otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pooltogether-v3-the-pool-token-sponsors-and-community-pools&#34;&gt;PoolTogether v3: the POOL token, sponsors and community pools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two versions of PoolTogether are online: v3 and v4. The concept remains the same but the infrastructure has greatly evolved. So before we look at what v4 has brought, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the still relevant v3 and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;accessible here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update was released &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defirate.com/pooltogether-v3/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;in October 2020&lt;/a&gt; shortly before &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/pooltogether/introducing-pool-23b09f36db48&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the POOL token&lt;/a&gt;, in February 2021. It brings many improvements to the PoolTogether infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sponsoring-pools-and-reserve-factor&#34;&gt;Sponsoring Pools and Reserve Factor
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the schematic explanation of earlier is useful, two initial subtleties must be added: sponsorship pools and the governance-controlled reserve factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with &lt;strong&gt;sponsoring&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea is to allow &amp;ldquo;non-player capital&amp;rdquo; to increase player earnings: this capital contributes to the output produced, but has no chance of winning. At first this was envisaged from a rather voluntary perspective, but with the launch of the token sponsors are now eligible for POOL rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Reserve&lt;/strong&gt; system is even simpler: each pool has a &lt;em&gt;Reserve Factor&lt;/em&gt; which corresponds to a % of the return captured by the pool directly. These funds are used to guarantee the sustainability of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v3, we also saw the arrival of &lt;em&gt;Community Pools&lt;/em&gt;, pools created by the community directly on the tokens of their choice, as long as they have a source of return, as well as many other additions that were more or less successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33t-lootboxes--pooltogether-on-polygon&#34;&gt;3,3T, Lootboxes &amp;amp; PoolTogether on Polygon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Olympus DAO offers a &lt;em&gt;3,3 Together&lt;/em&gt;, where players stake their OHM rebase: every three days the rebase of all players is distributed to the three winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also had other innovative ideas in v3 but they didn&amp;rsquo;t catch on, mainly because of the gas costs of the mainnet. For example, each pool has its &lt;em&gt;Lootbox&lt;/em&gt; which allows anyone to add an arbitrary token as a prize or even an NFT! Just send it to the lootbox address and when the next prize is distributed the NFT/token is automatically sent to the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The v3 also marked the arrival of the POOL token a few months later and its airdrop which we will talk about below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, v3 also marked the arrival of PoolTogether on other channels like Polygon or BSC. Nevertheless this logic has its limits because it also leads to a fragmentation of liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pooltogether-v4-tsunami-with-innovative-cross-chain-approach&#34;&gt;PoolTogether v4: Tsunami with innovative cross-chain approach
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The v4 is a very important iteration on the base proposed in v3. Here, the experience has been simplified and reworked to make it as accessible and fun as possible: and it works! Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-chain-egalitarian-approach&#34;&gt;Cross-chain egalitarian approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will detail this point because it is crucial, PoolTogether was a pioneer in this field and it is a dimension that we find on all projects: &lt;strong&gt;the cross-chain strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. It aims to offer the same service, whatever the channel used by the user. I&amp;rsquo;m coming to that, but before I do, let&amp;rsquo;s take the time to understand the classic cross-chain replication approach and its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-basic-approach-replication&#34;&gt;The basic approach: replication
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most projects simply &lt;strong&gt;replicate their service on all channels&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the case of Sushi for example, which is present on more than ten channels, but also Pool Together v3 as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has the merit of simplicity and allows access to the service on all covered channels - but it results in &lt;strong&gt;fragmentation of liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; which can make this service less qualitative on &amp;ldquo;small channels&amp;rdquo;. Thus PT v3 Polygon USDC players, now few in number, play for a weekly fee of $69. On the other hand PT v4 USDC players share a daily price of over $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tsunami&#34;&gt;Tsunami
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With PoolTogether v4 comes the so-called Tsunami model where all chains are equal. To do this, PoolTogether introduces an abstraction layer between all chains to redistribute prices if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows &lt;strong&gt;mutualizing depositors&amp;rsquo; funds across all chains&lt;/strong&gt; to offer one big attractive prize rather than multiplying pools and dividing prizes. One consequence is that players on Polygon (where the gas cost of depositing is marginal) can play with the same odds and payout expectation as mainnet players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course this requires more development and implementation work and there are consequences for players as well, the most notable being &lt;strong&gt;a one day delay between initial deposit and eligibility for the first draw&lt;/strong&gt;. But this is not too much of a trade-off considering the fact that PoolTogether is intended to be a game that promotes long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adjustment-of-the-pricing-model&#34;&gt;Adjustment of the pricing model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where v3 opted for flexibility, with pools having daily or weekly draws, the unique v4 pool can afford a &lt;strong&gt;daily draw&lt;/strong&gt; given its size. In addition, the prize structure has been revised to allocate more small prizes to make the experience a little less random in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/prize-breakdown-old.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;prize-breakdown-old&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jackpot logic is preserved with the first and only winner pocketing $2500 anyway, but there are also nearly 720 other potential winners with the $100 and $10 prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/winning.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tokenbrice-pooltogether-winning&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the number of winning players is lower because it is possible to win several prizes at once. However, this approach also smoothes out the income for large depositors, who frequently win $10 or $100 rewards, potentially even every day if the deposit is large enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distribution allows for frequent rewards for players who use PoolTogether for savings purposes while maintaining the spirit of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decent chance (depending on the size of the deposit) to have small winnings ($10 and $100 prizes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small chance of a massive payout: the $2500 jackpot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the prize model, the whole experience around prize allocation has been reviewed with v4. The governance has continued to iterate and recently voted on an overhaul of the prize structure: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-47-prize-adjustments/1752&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PTIP-47: Prize Adjustments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-more-satisfying-experience&#34;&gt;A more satisfying experience.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many settings and details have been adjusted to make the winning experience more fun and enjoyable. The complete list is on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.pooltogether.com/faq/v3-to-v4-differences&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the PoolTogether documentation&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;rsquo;ll just mention the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the winnings go into a &lt;strong&gt;claim logic&lt;/strong&gt;, where before they went directly into the wallet. This makes it easier for players to understand and quantify winnings. In addition, they are now paid out in PTaUSDC, the PoolTogether v4 lottery ticket, and are therefore &lt;strong&gt;automatically compounded&lt;/strong&gt;: winning increases your chances of winning, with a simple claim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pool-together/comparaison.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;comparison-pt-vs-savings&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Players have 60 days to claim their reward&lt;/strong&gt;, which guarantees a form of follow-up and commitment, but also allows an almost totally passive interaction with the protocol for those who wish to do so: deposit &amp;gt; every 59 days: claim &amp;gt; withdrawal when desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POOL token has been mentioned several times without digging into it: this was deliberate. Now that the system is clear to you, I propose to finish by analyzing its value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pool-token&#34;&gt;The POOL token
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will talk about airdrop of course, but also liquidity and of course governance: let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;airdrop-everybody-won&#34;&gt;Airdrop: everybody won!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To launch the most fun token of the DeFi, there couldn&amp;rsquo;t be anything else than an airdrop obviously. This is one of the retroactive airdrops that followed in the wake of Uniswap, but still came early enough that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly abused by the infamous airdrop hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14% of POOL&amp;rsquo;s total supply&lt;/strong&gt; was distributed to players who participated before January 14, 2021, with weighting based on deposit amount and duration. This was a nice surprise for early adopters, even with small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pool-incentives-and-lp-v3&#34;&gt;POOL incentives and LP (v3)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who says token also means most often incentives: PoolTogether is no exception to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the token came POOL incentives for all players; as well as adjustments to the sponsorship model described above. There is also a liquidity issue on the POOL token now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting with a classic incentive model for LPs, governance decided to explore a model that allows the protocol to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-40-olympus-lp-incentives-pool-pool-distribution/1638&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;control its own liquidity (PTIP-40&lt;/a&gt; through bonding (Ohm-like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;define-the-funtogether&#34;&gt;Define the &amp;ldquo;FunTogether&amp;rdquo;!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The POOL is used to take part in the protocol decisions and help to refine the model. Furthermore, the implementation of the governance itself is also fun. In order to vote, you have to deposit your POOL tokens in the POOL pool on PoolTogether: while having a basic return + chances to win prizes, players can thus vote on governance decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes call PoolTogether &amp;ldquo;the most fun protocol in the whole of DeFi&amp;rdquo;, a true statement but one that can be taken even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoolTogether governance, with its decisions, works to define what is &amp;ldquo;optimal fun&amp;rdquo;, with very concrete questions, like the number of prizes or their distribution. With the launch of v4, the number of prizes has greatly increased, allowing more players to win: more than half of the unique wallets playing PTv4 have won at least once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good start, but there&amp;rsquo;s probably room to refine the model even further to delight more players by positively promoting long-term savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read me this far, would you like some more alpha?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoolTogether&amp;rsquo;s lossless logic is exported beyond the lottery / savings&lt;/strong&gt;. Many social mechanisms and games around money can be involved: sports betting, prediction markets, insurance, etc. The lossless family will be large, and PoolTogether already knows a first cousin that tackles predictions markets: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.entropyfi.com/user-guide/game-explained&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Place your bets,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;(🎲,🎲) and have fun :) [web3]&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚖️ Liquity: an unstoppable, efficient and innovative borrowing service" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is still a unique protocol: it allows borrowing on ETH and mint of a stablecoin (LUSD) without requiring governance which makes it &amp;ldquo;unstoppable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is not always well understood, so let&amp;rsquo;s make it clear: the contracts necessary for the existence of Liquity and LUSD have been deployed and since they have no administrative functions, &lt;strong&gt;nothing can stop them as long as the Ethereum network is synchronizing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s not enough to excite your curiosity, the good news is that to achieve such a result, Liquity implements several new ideas that are really relevant. Indeed, in addition to its resilience, Liquity is also &lt;strong&gt;the least expensive&lt;/strong&gt; protocol for long term borrowing on ETH and also &lt;strong&gt;the most permissive in leverage&lt;/strong&gt;, outside of recovery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is therefore to introduce Liquity while expliciting several critical dimensions for any loan/money market service in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operation-of-the-protocol&#34;&gt;OPERATION OF THE PROTOCOL
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose an exhaustive tour of the protocol to understand the issues and contributions made to DeFi. Ideally, it would be to understand all the dynamics. However, I realize that my explanations can sometimes be dense, so I will offer them by level of complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-liquitys-fundamentals&#34;&gt;🏗 Liquity&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, Liquity works in a similar logic to Maker: users create &amp;ldquo;Troves&amp;rdquo; where they can deposit ETH in order to borrow stablecoins, LUSD, directly from the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;money-market-or-loan-service&#34;&gt;Money market or loan service?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Liquity and Maker are borrowing services but not money markets. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Who is lending to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either the protocol directly (borrowing service),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or other users via a pooling model like Aave or Compound (money market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is extremely important in terms of the competitiveness of the protocol: &lt;strong&gt;it is almost impossible, even theoretically, to envision a money market offering low stablecoin borrowing costs (&amp;lt;3 or 4% annual) on a sustainable basis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because money markets need to offer an attractive return to their stablecoin depositors, who have many, many alternatives for generating returns. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;if efficiency is a key objective, the borrowing service model that does not require deposits from other users is inherently more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; - the user borrows directly from the protocol at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s test the theory against the hard absurdity of practice: these considerations are valid for analyzing the design of a money market / borrowing service. There are &lt;strong&gt;borrowing services (which are supposed to be very efficient) which nevertheless manage to be expensive for borrowers, like MakerDAO&lt;/strong&gt;. The reasons for this are various, but the fact that the DAO still decides on the protocol fees (potentially in a totally arbitrary way) seems to me to be one of the main ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;borrowing-with-liquity&#34;&gt;Borrowing with Liquity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a potential user&amp;rsquo;s point of view, Liquity basically works as an alternative to Maker or something else: the user arrives with ETH that he deposits in his trove to mint the desired amount of LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the parallel stops here because although at a high level the process is similar, the underlying logic is totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;fees-management&#34;&gt;Fees management
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the crux of the matter: borrowing costs. On this subject and in addition to very low absolute borrowing costs, Liquity has the merit of bringing &lt;strong&gt;predictability and clarity.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, where Maker, Aave and Compound for example practice a variable annual rate (via governance for Maker, market conditions for Aave/Compound), &lt;strong&gt;at Liquity the rate is fixed and clearly announced at the time of the loan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, at Liquity the fees are paid in one go, at the time of the loan&amp;rsquo;s implementation: these are the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;initiation fees&amp;rdquo;, by default at 0.5%&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the only fee that the borrower pays, even if he keeps his trove for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/trove.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquity-trove&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Liquity is &lt;strong&gt;ideal for long term positions&lt;/strong&gt;, such borrowing costs are effectively 5-10x lower than what you can find on the main alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;stability-pool-liquidations-backstop&#34;&gt;Stability pool: liquidations backstop
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Liquity&amp;rsquo;s model already provides relevant benefits from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, its design also explores relevant solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues for borrowing services is of course that the protocol remains solvent: there are therefore, if necessary, liquidations to restore the balance. Liquidation of positions requires equity and a certain infrastructure when it is the users who do it directly, as on Marker or Aave. To optimize the process, the idea of a liquidity &amp;ldquo;backstop&amp;rdquo; has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is about having &lt;strong&gt;a reserve of funds, generally stablecoins that the protocol uses if necessary to manage liquidations&lt;/strong&gt;: it is the Stability Pool on Liquity. The users who wish to do so can deposit their LUSD in this pool: they are remunerated in LQTY (which we will detail next).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds in the Stability Pool are used when necessary for liquidations. As the system is now quite mature, liquidations tend to happen mostly in case of a sharp drop in the ETH price. A position in the Stability Pool therefore allows one to profit from these juicy liquidations without having the skills or infrastructure to execute them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stability Pool thus offers a rather gas-light and attractive native return option on the LUSD. With a conservative collateralization ratio, it may even be suitable for an almost entirely passive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the backstop concept is not implemented natively in the other major money markets, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the B.Protocol project&lt;/a&gt; acts as an abstraction layer offering the equivalent of this service to Maker, Aave and Compound (without the benefits of having it in-house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lqty-token--staking&#34;&gt;LQTY token &amp;amp; staking
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told you above: Liquity has no governance. The system automatically adjusts itself according to different parameters observed on the markets as we will see below. But then, what is the purpose of LQTY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most basic form, it is an accounting mechanism for allocating the revenues generated by the protocol. LQTY can be staked to obtain LUSD corresponding to its share of the initiation fee and ETH from the redemption fee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lqty-staking-returns.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;lqty-staking-returns&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for the essential points about Liquity and its main differences with the existing solutions. However, as always, the devil is in the details, so now that the basics are established, I propose to explore the arcana of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-complete-understanding-and-advanced-use&#34;&gt;🧙 Complete understanding and advanced use
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have stayed as much as possible in the perspective of a potential user. For this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to broaden our horizons to understand the subtleties of Liquity&amp;rsquo;s design. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;risks--limits&#34;&gt;Risks &amp;amp; limits
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have your attention, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about risks: this is also part of the subtleties to understand and take advantage of Liquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;-dependence-on-the-oracle&#34;&gt;🔮 Dependence on the oracle
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading me for a while, this sentence will probably tell you something: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;the truth about money markets is what the oracle says&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The oracle is the device that allows to obtain the necessary data on-chain, to be used by smart contracts. The critical data in question here is the price of ETH in USD, which determines whether a given position is solvent or needs to be liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the choice is classic: the main stream used is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ETH/USD ChainLink&lt;/a&gt;, with a fallback to Tellor (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations#what-oracle-are-you-using-to-determine-the-price-of-eth&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;). ChainLink is very widespread and robust, but one has to be aware of the fact that a problem with the ETH/USD ChainLink stream can quickly lead to serious consequences on Liquity (and pretty much the whole DeFi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;-the-lusd-against-its-1-peg&#34;&gt;⚖ The LUSD against its $1 peg
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD is a stablecoin, it&amp;rsquo;s great to mine it directly to push down borrowing costs as much as possible. But what about the stability of the LUSD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoin pegging is a pretty dense science, so we won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily go into detail, just the basics. The LUSD has various characteristics that allow it to establish a floor and a ceiling via arbitrage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floor: the redemption mechanism: an LUSD can be redeemed against ETH via a mechanism that we will explore next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceiling: the protocol guarantees an absolute minimum collateralization of LUSD with ETH at 110% under all conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, although the LUSD is holding its peg at $1 relatively well, the fluctuations in amplitude are more consistent than on a centralized stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lusd-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;lusd-price&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--Différentes situations extrêmes au niveau du marché (et donc du protocole) peuvent également amener à envisager un LUSD qui s&#39;écarte plus ou moins durablement du peg. Dans l&#39;ensemble, les mécanismes de stabilisation sont là pour ramener l&#39;équilibre sur le long-terme.--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various extreme situations in the market (and therefore in the protocol) can also lead to the possibility of an LUSD that deviates more or less permanently from the peg. On the whole, the stabilization mechanisms are there to bring back the balance in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-protocol-level-game&#34;&gt;A &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo; game
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity brings us to a very interesting notion that I call &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo;, for lack of a better word. It is about the possible interactions with the protocol whose consequences depend on the actions of the other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way and to use my favorite metaphor of MMORPGs :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvE = Player versus Environment (AI)&lt;/strong&gt;, in DeFi: simple farming &amp;amp; consequences of other players only secondary (e.g. dilution of yield when a 🐳 happens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvP = Player versus Player&lt;/strong&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s not missing even in DeFi!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the most interesting thing today is &lt;strong&gt;RvR (Realm vs Realm)&lt;/strong&gt;. Here again there is fighting between players, but it is &lt;strong&gt;a structured fight by faction&lt;/strong&gt;, with objectives to reach. The DeFi equivalent here is of course the CRV game on Curve!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see on Liquity some &amp;ldquo;protocol-level&amp;rdquo; mechanics that could be similar to RvR in this metaphor, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how they work :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;dynamic-initiationredemption-rate&#34;&gt;Dynamic initiation/redemption rate
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the most basic: fees. I mentioned above that the initiation fee is 0.5%: this is true, but slightly simplified. In reality this rate can vary between 0.5% and 5%: it is the &lt;code&gt;baseRate&lt;/code&gt; that governs the fee paid on both loans and redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Liquity is used heavily, the &lt;code&gt;baseRate&lt;/code&gt; increases. This is also a defensive mechanism for the protocol, which otherwise could be &amp;ldquo;emptied&amp;rdquo; of ETH by arbitrageurs (massive redemption LUSD-&amp;gt;ETH). The &amp;ldquo;decay&amp;rdquo; rate when the use calms down to come back nicely to 0.5% and I let you go see &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/faq/lusd-redemptions#how-is-the-baserate-calculated&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the math behind it&lt;/a&gt; on the doc for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;recovery-mode-as-terrifying-as-it-is-effective&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Recovery Mode&amp;rdquo;: as terrifying as it is effective?
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal use, &lt;strong&gt;Liquity is the most permissive protocol for leveraging on ETH, tolerating a collateralization ratio as low as 110%&lt;/strong&gt; (~90% of the net collateral value is borrowed). This is out of line with what is found elsewhere in DeFi, some references on ETH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maker offers collateralization ratios ranging from 58.8% for ETH-C to 76.9% for ETH-B (min collateral ratio of 130% to 170%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave is at 82.5% on ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound at 75%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the protocol can be so permissive, it is not because it takes more risks, but rather because several solutions are implemented to push users to re-collateralize when necessary: recovery mode and redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/recovery-mode.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;recovery-mode&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery mode is a protocol-level game on Liquity: its triggering depends on the &amp;ldquo;Total Collateral Ratio&amp;rdquo; of the protocol: the ratio between the total collateral and the LUSD due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this ratio falls &lt;strong&gt;below 150%, the Recovery Mode is activated to restore the balance&lt;/strong&gt;: the minimum collateralization threshold for a trove falls to 110%. Risky users are thus invited to re-collateralize or pay off debt - and/or will be liquidated if necessary when the recovery mode is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery mode is not a surprise, however, since it depends on a parameter that everyone can easily follow. Such a system makes it possible to maximize the efficiency of the protocol most of the time, while quickly reverting to more conservative settings if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-redemption-game&#34;&gt;The redemption game
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is one last mechanism to detail: redemptions, an arbitrage mechanism to exchange LUSD for ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a protocol-level game: redemptions are made using the liquidity available in the users&amp;rsquo; troves. &lt;strong&gt;When there is a redemption, the protocol starts by using the liquidity of the least collateralized trove on Liquity&lt;/strong&gt; and goes up as much as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, being &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; least collateralized trove on Liquity is not a very enviable position, since your collateral is at risk of being used for redemptions. If this is the case, the user will lose ETH, but they will also see their debt decrease (in proportion to the LUSDs traded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism pushes players to remain reasonable, even when the recovery mode is not activated: to avoid redemptions, one should not be the most aggressive. It is a sort of &lt;strong&gt;regulation mechanism whose exact threshold depends on the average leverage appetite of the other players&lt;/strong&gt;: in other words, a very elegant design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;decentralized-front-ends&#34;&gt;Decentralized front-ends
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this may be a detail for you but for me it means a lot: &lt;strong&gt;the Liquity team does not operate the application site&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, they have made available a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/sdk&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Frontend SDK&lt;/a&gt; to help other developers operate an instance of a Liquity frontend themselves. There is also a kickback mechanism to encourage these integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach allows Liquity to go even &lt;strong&gt;further than other protocols in terms of decentralization&lt;/strong&gt; and to offer solid guarantees that at least one of the front-ends will remain available no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness is just like the rest of the protocol: innovative, different, and truly relevant that you simply can&amp;rsquo;t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-and-lusd-in-the-defi-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Liquity and LUSD in the DeFi ecosystem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article because I see Liquity as an essential DeFi primitive and I&amp;rsquo;d like to help you understand why. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who understands what&amp;rsquo;s at stake here, many protocols are interested in Liquity and LUSD in one way or another. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defi-liquity-integrations&#34;&gt;DeFi Liquity Integrations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are the various protocols that integrate one or more parts of Liquity and thus offer new opportunities to LQTY or LUSD owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;liquity-lusdlqty-and-farming&#34;&gt;Liquity LUSD/LQTY and farming
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest Finance&lt;/a&gt; offers an LQTY vault based on staking: the LUSD and ETH obtained are frequently composed of more LQTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.pickle.finance/farms&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pickle Finance&lt;/a&gt; proposes a similar product (pJar 0.98l) as well as a particular vault in partnership with B.Protocol to maximize the obtained LQTY:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/pickle-lusd.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pickle-lusd&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main source of liquidity for LUSD is the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/lusd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve Pool&lt;/a&gt;, also available with Convex.&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;visor-uni-lqty&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity is also supported on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, to manage leverage more easily and protect troves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the quick overview of the main integrations. DAOs are also interested in LUSD because it is the only unstoppable stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lusd-a-dao-cash-snack&#34;&gt;LUSD: A DAO cash snack?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUSD&amp;rsquo;s inherent properties have already earned it some attention in DeFi. For example, after accumulating a lot of liquidity on DAI and FRAX, Olympus turned to LUSD with the accumulation of LUSD and LP Sushi LUSD/OHM via the bond mechanism. LUSD is now one of the main assets owned by OlympusDAO (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-%28OHM%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/olympus-lusd.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;olympus-lusd&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ohmies are not going to stop there: they love productive assets, and Liquity is not lacking in them: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/177-tap-5-whitelist-liquity-lusd-stability-pool-and-lqty-staking&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; is therefore that the protocol deploys its LUDS in the Stability Pool to accumulate LQTYs which will also be staked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was even classic liquidity mining on the LUSD/OHM pair, but revisited. With Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://crucible.alchemist.wtf/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Crucible &lt;/a&gt;a smart contract wallet NFT to easily manage LP positions, a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/how-to-earn-rewards-on-the-lusd-ohm-pool-using-alchemists-crucible&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;35 day program &lt;/a&gt;was offered, with rewards in OHM, LUSD and MIST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other protocols seeking resilience, diversification and stability for their cash flow have also taken the plunge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fei, a protocol offering a different type of stablecoin, has diversified its collateral into LUSD and now has over 50M LUSD: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.fei.money/analytics&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Analytics Fei Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Synthetix team is also interested in bringing the LUSD onto Optimism, which could help stabilize the LUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/token/0x5f98805A4E8be255a32880FDeC7F6728C6568bA0#balances&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The top holder LUSD &lt;/a&gt; already has several DAOs and &lt;strong&gt;as with RAI&lt;/strong&gt; I think the trend may grow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/liquity-protocol/lusd-holders.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;lusd-holders&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other integrations are still possible, like for example the direct integration of the stability pool on a pool fuse to allow a more optimal use of the stability pool&amp;rsquo;s assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has aroused your curiosity: Liquity has been available since last April and yet very few people realize the elegance and minimalism of this protocol that offers credible solutions to real challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, there are no secrets:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Long live to free and on-chain auditable wrestling</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/luchadores-nft/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Long live to free and on-chain auditable wrestling" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is going to be more personal than usual, but given the subject I can&amp;rsquo;t do otherwise. We&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on an NFT project in which I&amp;rsquo;m strongly involved: the Luchadores. They are fully onchain wrestlers, soon to be characters in an upcoming game, also onchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than the project itself, I will explain the thesis I am developing about it. I think this approach may interest you and help you develop personal beliefs about other collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t detail the mechanics of the Luchadores or the upcoming game. Feel free to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://whitepaper.luchadores.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the whitepaper now available&lt;/a&gt; for more info on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-thesis-on-the-luchadores&#34;&gt;📑 My thesis on the Luchadores
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not yet well informed about NFTs and my activities in this area, feel free to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/nft/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduction page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four main reasons for my interest in the Luchadores and my enthusiasm for this collection, so let&amp;rsquo;s get right to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-an-innovative-and-inclusive-generation-process&#34;&gt;🔮 An innovative and inclusive generation process
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generation of the Luchadores was a fully onchain process thanks to the use of Chainlink&amp;rsquo;s VRF. It allows to &lt;strong&gt;generate random numbers in a verifiable way&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to this feature, the minting of a Luchadores was done with the guarantee that there were no possible manipulations, and the proof of the calculation remains available for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this innovative technical dimension that helped me spot the project initially. Limited to &lt;strong&gt;10,000 Luchadores in total&lt;/strong&gt;, the mint remained available for about &lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; (March-&amp;gt;June 2021), with some excitement in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long minting period allowed everyone who wanted to be involved to do so, with plenty of time to achieve more timely transaction costs if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation was done at the price of 2 LINK (fee needed for the VRF mechanism), paid in ETH + gas costs. Depending on the LINK price and the transaction costs on the network, miners paid between 0.015 and 0.025 ETH per Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verifiable random generation has given rise to some rather amusing &amp;ldquo;trivia&amp;rdquo; facts about the Luchadores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-distribution.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;luchadores-distribution&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of rarity is a normal curve: there are more than 8000 Luchadores (81.3%) in the group of 3, 2 or 4 attributes, the most common. The closer we get to the extremes, the rarer the Luchadores become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;0.11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could have been a Luchador with 8 attributes, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. There would most likely have been only one: no Lucha god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the attribute &amp;ldquo;mustache&amp;rdquo; falls on a Luchador whose skin color is very close to the one used for the mustache, creating a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://luchadores.io/luchador/8085&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hidden mustache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These Luchadores are given special attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-onchain-approach&#34;&gt;⛓ The onchain approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the generation done entirely onchain, the visual of the Luchadores is in an optimized format (svg) that allows &lt;strong&gt;storage directly on the Ethereum chain&lt;/strong&gt;, thus bringing a consequent resilience to the media associated to each NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there since the upcoming game, which we discuss next, will also rely on &lt;strong&gt;verifiable random generation mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. So in the arena, critical hits or dodges will be the result of verifiable randomness and very hard to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/AFA-score.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-art-for-all&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one to notice this very resilient approach, which also appealed to the Link marines. Luchadores is also the only 100/100 project with Avastars on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://artforall.io/score?search=&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ArtForAll, a service that evaluates the resilience of NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, one could describe the project as &amp;ldquo;on chain maximalist&amp;rdquo; but it is not the case: compromises, unfortunately necessary, are envisaged at the level where it is possible to afford it: the random draws related to the game, will be realized on a sidechain (Polygon) or a rollup. This will allow &lt;strong&gt;to keep the game accessible and inexpensive&lt;/strong&gt;, while taking advantage of maximum guarantees for the NFT, which is always warm on the Ethereum chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-luchadores--the-game&#34;&gt;🎮 Luchadores : The Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game itself probably resonates with my nostalgic side. Indeed, the fight will be &lt;strong&gt;turn by turn&lt;/strong&gt;, with a system of attributes (stats), passive skills and triggered skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-stats.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you read up on the impact of attributes and skills, but as a fan of turn-based games, strategies and RPGs, I can tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m ready for theorycraft 🧙&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An associated token&lt;/strong&gt; (LUCHA) will be available to be won. It will also be distributed in the first year to NFT Luchadores owners. The token will have several forms of use related to the game (respect, prodigy system, rename?) and can also be &lt;strong&gt;staked to earn MASK&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-transferable token (only in-game) useful to equip your Luchadores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-community-and-its-history&#34;&gt;📜 The community and its history
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is developed by a single person, Luchador, who was gradually joined by several profiles needed for the development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the beginning, community members emerged like Teh_Griz and LuchaBroy: they became the first moderators of the Discord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got progressively involved, to help make the project known, to develop the French-speaking community and to bring my help where it is relevant, more info later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A game designer and two pixel artists (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/AbueloRetroWave/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AbueloRetroWave&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/m3r0j&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;m3r0j&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking here only about &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; implications. Of course, we must not forget all the community initiatives. It is impossible to list them all here, but I will mention them anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicosz who created a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/sznicolas/luchadata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tool in Python to analyze data related to Luchadores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dune.xyz/lokhidor/Luchadores&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;dashboard to track key metrics on Luchadores&lt;/a&gt;, offered by cnhkp.eth, using Dune Analytics and thanks to Nicosz&amp;rsquo; help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or OxMule which has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://whitepaper.luchadores.io/v/francais/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;translated the whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without forgetting the many collectors and &amp;ldquo;snipers&amp;rdquo; of the Discord who animate it every day, like Chainlinkers, one of the first members of the community who won two giveaways in a row on his birthday and became a legend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-involvement&#34;&gt;🐒 My involvement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered the Luchadores in May, I minted about 80 of them and I followed the project quite passively at the beginning. In June, when the craze started to be more palpable, I got more actively involved, first as a moderator for the French community and then as an administrator of the Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see my involvement in the project as an opportunity to educate about the technical dimensions of NFTs. I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose this project at random: I think that the SVG onchain approach used by the Luchadores is among the most credible, despite the graphical compromise (-&amp;gt; pixel style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, I animate the community with different giveaways and I help to make the Luchadores known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-my-luchadores&#34;&gt;🃏 My Luchadores
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty unlucky at minting my Luchadores, so I&amp;rsquo;ve made up for my luck with my acquisitions. Although most of them are a mechanical cleaning of the floor price, mostly between 0.025 and 0.035 ETH, I also acquired some rarer Luchadores including three 7 attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best catch is the &amp;ldquo;Batman&amp;rdquo;, a &amp;ldquo;7 attributes&amp;rdquo; that will be one of my main fighters in the arena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-lucha-7-attributes-8956&#34;&gt;⭐ Lucha 7 attributes #8956
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/luchadores-nft/luchadores-8956.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;luchadores-8956&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in possession of 3 Luchadores 7 attributes, &lt;strong&gt;I wish to put one back into play&lt;/strong&gt;. This one will not go to the highest bidder&amp;hellip; no way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://luchadores.io/luchador/8956&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Luchador #8956&lt;/a&gt; will be won in the arena&lt;/strong&gt;, so it will go to the most skilled player. Looking forward to sharing more details about the allocation mechanism when the game is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-giveaways&#34;&gt;🎁 Giveaways
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have minted about 80 Luchadores, and bought over 150 on OpenSea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to use a good part of it as a &amp;ldquo;promotional budget&amp;rdquo; for the Luchadores - and it is already done. Several distributions have taken place and a good 50 have already been given away, including 25 to the top wheat farmer DeFi France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest, as I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the skin-in-the-game concept (direct involvement with consequences), and given my involvement in the project I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it any other way. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any Luchadores in my possession on other wallets, I centralize everything on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opensea.io/tokenbrice?search[sortBy]=LISTING_DATE&amp;amp;search[query]=luchadores&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

Choosing when and which jpeg/svg to acquire is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luchadores first traded near the cost of minting, before establishing a second floor around 0.03 ETH. Since the end of September, with the arrival of the whitepaper, the craze is palpable and is reflected on the floor (price) now around 0.07 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a wrestler&amp;hellip; great, but at what price? Don&amp;rsquo;t expect a direct answer from me on that. At this point in time and at this stage of development, it is still a gamble. Nevertheless, the approach is relevant and I think that Luchadores has the potential to enter the NFTs canon, pushing the frontier of interactivity made possible with these digital objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a Luchadores today means paying about three times minimum the price seen a few weeks ago - and yet it would be a good deal if the current trend continues 🔮 welcome to the world of NFTs, where pricing is a social and highly reflective mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now place your bets, &amp;ldquo;rien ne va plus&amp;rdquo; 🎲.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m only talking about it now on the blog because I wanted to take the time to articulate my thoughts. Those who follow me live or on Twitter heard about the project in May and could read about it directly, if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you understand what it is about a collection of wrestlers that fascinates me, and more generally how I analyze a collection, and that it will also help you evaluate others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/crv-wars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/curve-wars-cover-tokenbrice.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚔ CRV wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of Curve Finance and the launch of the CRV token, we have been waiting, contemplating and assuming what the CRV war could bring. Now, with the launch of Convex, then Bribe.crv and finally Votium, everything is accelerating: VeCRV votes can now be bought! So let&amp;rsquo;s see how this impacts Curve and DeFi as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the question is quite simple and straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve is the largest decentralized DeFi exchange in terms of total value deposited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CRV token provides access to 1/ a share of the fees collected 2/ &lt;strong&gt;a voting power to influence the issuance of future CRVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;=&amp;gt; Having control over a large CRV voting power makes it &lt;strong&gt;much easier to develop a Curve pool&lt;/strong&gt;, since it offers the possibility to vote for large CRV returns on the pool in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as often in DeFi, everything is not so simple and the devil is in the details. To understand the stakes of the CRV war, you need to have &lt;strong&gt;a good understanding of the different tools built on it&lt;/strong&gt;. This will allow you to judge the relevance of the strategies deployed by the different projects that seek to influence Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convex-and-the-vecrv-separation&#34;&gt;Convex and the VeCRV separation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing the battlefields - i.e. the different tools used in this CRV war - we need to look more deeply at one in particular: Convex. I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it on this blog, explaining &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-flywheel.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the flywheel dimension of Convex with the CvxCRV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions of Convex with Curve go far beyond the CvxCRV, which is only one element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;strong&gt;one could describe Convex as a separation between governance and returns on VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; by amplifying each of the elements on a separate token. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cvxcrv--vecrv-yield&#34;&gt;CvxCRV = VeCRV-yield++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a VeCRV owned by Convex. They are locked in forever, but the liquidity available on CvxCRV/CRV allows depositors to close out their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of governance, CvxCRV loses all its capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; : VeCRV owner can vote on gauges (CRV issue) and governance votes. A CvxCRV owner has no other benefit than the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;the return is amplified compared to a simple possession of VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in 3pool token - the share of fees collected on Curve - exactly like VeCRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return in CRV (10% of all CRV farmed by Convex shared between all CvxCRV stakers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually the same yield in CVX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential airdrops like Ellipsis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CvxCRV corresponds to a simple compromise compared to VeCRV: governance capabilities are lost (-&amp;gt; vlCVX) but in return the performance is greatly amplified and diversified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vlcvx--vecrv-gov&#34;&gt;vlCVX = VeCRV-gov++
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Convex offers another interesting abstraction from Curve. It is its native CVX token. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;each CVX corresponds to a VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; voting capability (which comes from CvxCRV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mobilize it, the depositor must &amp;ldquo;vote lock&amp;rdquo; his CVX in vlCVX. They are locked for 16 weeks + 3 days and so provide access to governance capacity. Currently, vlCVX is by far the most economically efficient way to accrue Curve voting capacity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Price
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Voting power
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV-vote/$
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Commitment
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$2.42
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1 veCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;0.41
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;4 years
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;vlCVX
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;$8.2
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;12,75 VeCRV
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;1.55
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;16 weeks + 3 days
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increased profitability of CVX to influence Curve, the commitment is also less than on VeCRV. For the comparison table, I assumed a 4-year lock on CRV. The difference is even more in favor of vlCVX for shorter commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to further analyze the returns offered by the delegation of CVX and the associated vote buying, feel free to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@portiadog/convex-finance-1cc6c9c1c733&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribes-a-not-so-clean-separation&#34;&gt;Bribes: a not so clean separation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation was clear, but it did not remain so for long. Indeed, it should first be noted that vlCVX is not without returns: &lt;strong&gt;vlCVX owners share 6% of all CRVs farmed by Convex, in the form of CvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this is potentially not the only return for which vlCVX owners are eligible. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;governance capacity can also offer a substantial return via bribe mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; (vote buying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different projects offer incentives for voting on the gauge of a given Pool Curve. For example, Alchemix offers rewards in ALCX, its native token, which can be claimed each week by all those who used their VeCRV to vote to increase the CRV allocation of the AlUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, it is not impossible that the initial separation planned by Convex is not the most honest. Currently, the yield on cvxCRV is about 60% while it is only 15% on CVX. Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;when you add the bribes into the equation, it is not impossible that the yield on vlCVX is much higher than on cvxCRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-battlefields&#34;&gt;The battlefields
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bribes&amp;rdquo; services are an essential part of the Curve governance equation. However, before digging into them, we need to recall the basic path (veCRV) that defines the framework for all its variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeCRV is obtained by locking CRV for up to 4 years. The longer the lock, the closer the VeCRV/CRV ratio is to 1. &lt;strong&gt;The lock gradually depletes over time as does the voting capacity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why vaults built on VeCRV operate on a 4-year perpetual locking logic: in order to preserve a voting capacity that is always as close to the maximum possible, &lt;strong&gt;they &amp;ldquo;refresh&amp;rdquo; the locking frequently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribe-v0--direct-incentive-on-pools&#34;&gt;Bribe v0 : direct incentive on pools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about bribes, it is worth remembering there is a primitive form that has been available since the early days of Curve: additional incentives (on top of CRVs) for liquidity providers. Synthetix pioneered this with the SNX liquidity mining program on the sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct incentives can be combined with bribes, and are even recommended. We will see below how MIM, for example, obtained much more activity by sharing its budget between incentives and bribes (after an initial phase without bribes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bribecrv-by-cronje-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Bribe.crv by Cronje [with veCRV]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &amp;ldquo;bribes&amp;rdquo; are purchases of VeCRV votes. They are paid by the week, generally on Friday (the day the votes are taken into account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just as there are several systems for interacting with VeCRV, there are also several mechanisms for bribes. So we start with the one that was available first: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bribe.crv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://bribe.crv.finance/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic unit is the VeCRV. Bribe.crv is a simple interface that summarizes the different offers and allows to collect its bribes. Voting is done directly on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a somewhat timid start, the service is being used more and more and many projects are now proposing bribes. The returns in the first few weeks have been excellent, it remains to be seen if they will last. For example, I got &lt;strong&gt;about 10% return on my VeCRV (/ current price) in 5 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; by voting for the MIM pool and receiving SPELL tokens in bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to the results below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;votium-with-vlcvx&#34;&gt;Votium [with vlCVX]
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alternative available is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://votium.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Votium&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the basic unit is the vlCVX, so the two services are not competitors but complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Votium is more recent so the available bribes are more limited. On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;Votium already controls an impressive voting power: about 8M CVX or more than 102M VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is potentially more passive than with bribe.crv since depositors can delegate to Votium who will take care of voting each week for them and collect the corresponding bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with an active delegation, a depositor can at any time take back control and vote for a given pool, directly on snapshot (-&amp;gt; no gas cost). The system is therefore more flexible than bribe.crv in this respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services to handle bribes are also in development with a release in the near future. So far the bribe game has focused mainly on CRV, but &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.paladin.vote/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, intends to offer a similar mechanism with other protocols as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-into-practice-tactics-and-results&#34;&gt;Putting it into practice: tactics and results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual bases are a bit heavy on this subject, but it is essential to understand them. To make it more explicit, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the practical side with concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spellmim-case&#34;&gt;The Spell/MIM case
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://abracadabra.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Abracadabra&lt;/a&gt; is a Maker service. Various assets are accepted as collateral, including productive assets such as xSUSHI or cvx3pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Maker produces DAI, Abracadabra produces a stablecoin (on the dollar) called MIM. The liquidity available on MIM, as well as the opportunity for returns, is therefore a key factor in the platform&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Abracadabra has progressively gone through all forms of direct or indirect bribes on Curve :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It started with a SPELL incentive (governance token) on the Curve/MIM pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When bribe.crv arrived, &lt;strong&gt;a portion of that incentive was reallocated to bribe&lt;/strong&gt; - thus distributed to veCRV owners who vote for the MIM gauge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, with the arrival of vlCVX, the team is considering reallocating the budget through this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, the MIM pool has exploded on Curve, at all levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV yields were really good in some weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has attracted liquidity and volume, slightly reducing the yield but increasing the ability to boost the pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result of this momentum, MIM is now the fifth largest pool curve in terms of volume, with a nice volume/TVL ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/crv-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pool is now well balanced and rather dense (&amp;gt; $700M total liquidity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example of Abracadabra is extremely instructive, as it demonstrates the relevance of the abstractions built on VeCRV: &lt;strong&gt;without increasing its total budget, Abracadabra has been able to attract much more liquidity than at the time of the simple direct incentive in SPELL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You therefore understand that DeFi projects that take advantage of the veCRV, cvxCRV and vlCVX mechanisms have an undeniable advantage (&lt;strong&gt;economic AND political&lt;/strong&gt;) over those who have not yet grasped all their subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sdvecrv-vs-cvxcrv&#34;&gt;sdveCRV VS cvxCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;I now consider understanding Curve and the ability to effectively influence its governance to be an essential and required capability in most DeFi projects, especially for stablecoin projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to take my word for it though, let&amp;rsquo;s compare in practice two approaches implemented by projects with similar issues: liquidity strategies on cvxCRV (from Convex) and sdveCRV (from StakeDAO) - two abstractions built on veCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the situations are similar, there are some important differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by recalling that Convex controls more than 30 times the amount of CRV controlled by Stake (102M vs 3M).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, sdveCRV has serious problems with its peg: 1 sdveCRV ~= 0.5 CRV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/sdvecrv-peg.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sdvecrv-peg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sdvecrv-liquidity-plan-total-misunderstanding-and-abject-failure&#34;&gt;sdveCRV liquidity plan: total misunderstanding and abject failure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the analysis. Initially the liquidity of sdveCRV was against ETH just like Yearn. Since Convex, the Stake team is trying to react to make sdveCRV more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team clearly did not take the time to analyze the situation and rushed into what turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;one of the biggest governance failures ever seen on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating an anemic sdveCRV/CRV pool via the Curve Factory, a vote was taken to add the gauge control (= CRV incentives). Not only was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/83&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the vote overwhelmingly rejected&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;the sdveCRV pool is set up in an aberrant and absolutely dangerous way for depositors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the factor A (amplification parameter) of the pool is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/34&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;set to 200&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a correct value for assets that follow the same peg, but &lt;strong&gt;delusional if one asset is worth twice the other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/crv-wars/sdvecrv-mim-crv-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sdvecrv-mim-crv-pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea, even the aforementioned absolutely massive MIM pool (7000x the liquidity of the sdveCRV pool) has not yet reached 200 of A factor (119 currently, increasing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, not only did Stake fail to solve its liquidity problem on sdveCRV, but &lt;strong&gt;such a course of events clearly raises the question of the Stake team&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the intricacies of Curve/Convex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get sdveCRV back to peg and develop its liquidity, they will need a lot of effort, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the pool parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct incentives in SDT on the pool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these steps are completed, the team would then have a chance to get the CRV gauge on this pool, but not before. So the current situation looks like a costly dead end: &lt;strong&gt;no way out unless the SDT board is heated (even more)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cvxcrv-liquidity-plan-immediate-take-off&#34;&gt;cvxCRV liquidity plan: immediate take-off
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the liquidity plan on cvxCRV demonstrates how effective the process can be. Initially (and still today), the main pool for cvxCRV is on Sushiswap, against CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation does not really make sense: &lt;strong&gt;Sushi is far from optimal for optimizing liquidity across assets that follow the same peg&lt;/strong&gt;. So when Curve launched factory pools (V2), the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/factory/22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cvxCRV/CRV pool&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note here the A Factor at 50 - while cvxCRV holds its peg much better than sdveCRV&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;cvxcrv-pool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any incentive from Convex or Curve, the pool has already seen significant volume flow through DEX aggregators like Paraswap. Soon, there was a vote to add the CRV gauge which passed - and this pool is now farmable directly through Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool remains slightly unbalanced (there is so much to do with CRVs, which are becoming increasingly rare&amp;hellip;) but it already brings a competitive alternative to the SLP cvxCRV/CRV pool with still a fraction of its liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you grasp the intricacies of the extended veCRV ecosystem and their implications for the CRV battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before concluding, I would like to remind you that as usual the alpha is in the nooks and crannies. If you have understood this article, feel free to export the liquidity strategy analysis to other projects: I am sure it will be instructive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you often, but it will never be enough: not only Curve is the most important DEX in DeFi but it is also &lt;strong&gt;the most advanced protocol in terms of governance and tokenomics by far compared to anything else&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you have no interest in Curve/Convex, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand these protocols in order to properly consider what&amp;rsquo;s going on in DeFi&amp;hellip; Hopefully this article will help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🗿 Reflexer Labs (RAI) : the What, How and Why</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/reflexer-rai/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/reflexer-rai/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🗿 Reflexer Labs (RAI) : the What, How and Why" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a strange beast that many people still don&amp;rsquo;t understand or care about, including people who are really knowledgeable about DeFi. So it was time to offer you a rather exhaustive article dedicated to its subject. I&amp;rsquo;ve included everything I thought was relevant to understand why an asset like RAI is needed, what it does and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get a cup of coffee and hang on, we&amp;rsquo;re in for a great ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-rais-context&#34;&gt;Understanding RAI&amp;rsquo;s context
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we even begin to get into the nitty-gritty, I think it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand the context around RAI, i.e. the main stable assets used today and their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context for understanding RAI is quite dense, but the good news is that this is not the first time I have covered this topic on the blog. So I&amp;rsquo;ll refer you to some relevant reading to go deeper into the subject :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-innovations.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Understanding innovations in money markets to envision their future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to explore the concept in depth with the articles proposed above, here are the two essential points to remember to fully understand the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;strong&gt;the overwhelming majority of the stablecoin demand is covered by centralized solutions requiring trust&lt;/strong&gt;, the most used being USDT (~66 billion) and USDC (~27 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your preferred economic theses, especially in terms of inflation, I think we can easily agree on the need for stable assets that are not correlated to a fiduciary currency (= managed by a state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wusdc-trick&#34;&gt;The wUSDC trick
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the term &amp;ldquo;wrapped USDC&amp;rdquo; (wUSDC) to describe a situation that is common in alternative stablecoins: it is used to concisely and appropriately describe &lt;strong&gt;solutions that essentially use USDC as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, a trusted stablecoin guaranteed by a central agency (Circle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, there is no need to go further, not even to analyze the details of the system: since their main collateral can be frozen or seized, &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins produced&lt;/strong&gt; in this way cannot be considered decentralized or trustless.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of assets has a surprisingly large following, the main ones being Maker and Frax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maker--a-majority-of-collateral-requiring-trust&#34;&gt;Maker = a majority of collateral requiring trust
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/sky/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker (DAI)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;approximately 60% of DAI are minted with USDC as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, to which figure we need to add those minted from other collaterals requiring trust: wBTC, TUSD, GUSD, PAX, USDT, renBTC + all UniV2 pairs involving at least one of these tokens + all collaterals from the real world such as Centrifuge: New Silver. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://daistats.com/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Details on DAIStats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;dai-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: PSM is a module that prevents excessive price volatility of DAI. It is therefore automatically minted by the PSM when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of Maker, before the Multi Collateral DAI update (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@MakerDAO/update-the-road-to-multi-collateral-dai-2d4c48092270&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MCD - 18/11/2019&lt;/a&gt;) used only ETH as collateral and thus presented much more credible guarantees. This is no longer the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙏 Nevertheless, I warmly thank the MakerDAO team for their very many contributions to the ecosystem - the Maker MCD model is even used as a basis by Reflexer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;frax--guaranteed-by-usdc-or-nothing-algorithmic&#34;&gt;FRAX ? Guaranteed by USDC or nothing (algorithmic)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the FRAX side, only USDC is used as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;, in various forms - either in Yearn/Compound/Aave to produce a return, or via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AMOs (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller)&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the details of the assets that are used to collateralize FRAX, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.frax.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;available on the official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/frax-collateral.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;frax-collateral&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Frax and DAI are developing a myriad of interesting approaches, but since their basis is centralized, &lt;strong&gt;they cannot be considered anything more than a mechanism for amplifying the liquidity available on USDC, at best&lt;/strong&gt;. They do, however, make &lt;strong&gt;interesting contributions in terms of fundamental research&lt;/strong&gt; that may help establish a more optimal solution that does not require trustlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-there-relevant-alternatives-to-rai&#34;&gt;Are there relevant alternatives to RAI?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, RAI is a unique asset with no comparable alternative. However, there are systems that share certain characteristics with RAI, such as &lt;strong&gt;the exclusive use of ETH as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are ready to expose yourself to the dollar, Liquity offers a very relevant alternative which also has &lt;strong&gt;the merit of being totally unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt; (which is not yet the case with RAI): the contracts have no administrative function, exactly like Uniswap V1/V2. However, there are still the oracles (necessary for a loan service) and the associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the stage is set, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the main course: it&amp;rsquo;s time to study the underlying mechanisms of RAI. We&amp;rsquo;ll start by how to mint it from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective before going into more detail about what RAI actually is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-rai-created-&#34;&gt;How is the RAI created ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI is in some ways &lt;strong&gt;both the primary and final form of Maker&amp;rsquo;s DAI&lt;/strong&gt;. First, in the sense that it returns to the promises of the original DAI (the SAI): only the ETH is used as collateral, and final in the sense that RAI manages to extricate itself from the dollar dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflexer is based on a Maker MCD with several changes, including the incorporation of the PID controller, protection against liquidations and many others. We will slowly unfold all this but let&amp;rsquo;s start by seeing how the system works from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like on Maker, RAI is created directly by Reflexer users. Users can open &lt;strong&gt;a safe that allows them to stake ETH and mine a proportional amount of RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. Each user can choose the amount of RAI minted for the same amount of ETH at stake (-&amp;gt; different risk levels) and must manage his position. &lt;strong&gt;Liquidation is possible and necessary&lt;/strong&gt; because it ensures that there is always enough ETH in the system to guarantee the RAI issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the system here is innovating compared to Maker thanks to its &amp;ldquo;Savior&amp;rdquo; function. It allows &lt;strong&gt;to use a RAI/ETH liquidity position on Uniswap V2 as a guarantee for a safe&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, if the ETH price were to fall suddenly, which could put an open safe protected by this function at risk of liquidation, &lt;strong&gt;the Savior automatically withdraws the quantity of liquidity necessary to bring the safe back to the desired collateralization level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows users who mint RAI and then use it to provide liquidity to sleep much more peacefully!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-is-rai-exactly-&#34;&gt;But what is RAI exactly ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is a new asset class in its own way. It aims to be &lt;strong&gt;low volatility, without relying on another stable asset&lt;/strong&gt; (fiat currency or gold are the most traditional sources). To do this, RAI relies on a system that reacts dynamically to market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of RAI, there are two key parameters to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The redemption price&lt;/strong&gt; = value of a unit of debt in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market price&lt;/strong&gt; = everything is in the name !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the system has no control over the RAI price observed in the market, which is determined by buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, it can gradually adjust certain parameters to modify the redemption price and &lt;strong&gt;converge the two prices in the future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are therefore faced with a situation that can be generalized quite easily, embodied by an entire field of engineering and called &lt;strong&gt;control theory&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/control-theory.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;control-theory&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of RAI, &lt;strong&gt;the controller is algorithmic&lt;/strong&gt; and again quite standard: it is the famous &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;PID controller &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is based on a fairly dense mathematical formula that it is not necessary to understand in order to understand the relevance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one essential point must be understood: the inherent inertia of the system. The controller cannot afford to make sudden changes in the parameters (which would be detrimental to its relative stability), so it must operate in a more iterative and progressive logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is understood, let me remind you that the system by itself cannot affect the price of RAI. All it can do is vary the redemption rate, which modulates the incentives of system participants. This creates &lt;strong&gt;arbitrage opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; for those participants whose execution brings them closer to the equilibrium between the redemption price and the market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a logic here that is reminiscent of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;algorithmic stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;, although the end product of the system is totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-market-price--redemption-price&#34;&gt;When market price &amp;gt; redemption price
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start with this situation because I think it is simpler to understand. In the case where the market price exceeds the redemption price, that means anyone with ETH available could potentially generate a profit by arbitraging the market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH deposit and RAI mint;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sale of RAI in the market for a profit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(When market price &amp;lt; redemption) repurchase of RAI to pay off debt and release ETH. The difference between the 2 prices on RAI - fees in gas is the profit generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/marchesupredemption-en.PNG&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;marchesupredemption&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is all the more interesting for those who already have safes with available capacity: they save themselves a step in the scenario presented above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, there is therefore an incentive to mint RAI (-&amp;gt;increase supply) and to sell it on the market (-&amp;gt;bearish pressure) which gradually reduces the price on the market, making it converge towards the redemption price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-market-price--redemption-price-1&#34;&gt;When market price &amp;lt; redemption price
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opposite case, the redemption rate becomes positive, making the existing debt more expensive. Users with active safes have an interest in paying off their debt, which reduces the available supply of RAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/reflexer-rai/marcheinfredemption-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;marcheinfredemption&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if they had converted their RAI to another asset (e.g. ETH for leveraged exposure), they will have to acquire RAI in the market (-&amp;gt;bullish pressure) in order to be able to repay their debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is in the best interest of the Reflexer system players to monitor the redemption rate and react accordingly. If you have an active safe, I invite you to consult it regularly - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stats.reflexer.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;it can be seen on the Reflexer website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rate impacts simple RAI owners less directly, especially if they use them to produce a return (which can offset a negative rate) but it is still a metric to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-adjustment-of-the-redemption-rate&#34;&gt;Dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate is one of the essential features of Reflexer / RAI&lt;/strong&gt;. To better understand why this is critical, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the situation on Maker pre-MCD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The demand for DAI is (part of) the demand for stablecoins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, DAI are created by leveraging ETH, so they depend on the need/appetite for leverage on ETH, which is independent of the demand for stablecoins, which mostly depends on general market conditions (bear or bull and others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If demand is higher than supply, on Maker, there is no dynamic adjustment. You have to wait for a vote of the governance (and the delays that go with it) to lower the Stability Fee. And it&amp;rsquo;s the same in the other direction (too much supply).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;strong&gt;the balance between the supply and demand side of the equation is almost impossible to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;, which is why the pre-MCD DAI could often end up above its peg. Maker solved this problem by adding many types of collateral, including non-trustless stablecoins and then the PSM which automatically mints DAI from USDC when needed. The solution proposed by Reflexer (dynamic adjustment of the redemption rate) has the merit of &lt;strong&gt;solving the problem at the level of the system itself&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows to keep ETH as the only collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flx-and-rais-de-governance-strategy&#34;&gt;FLX and RAI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;de-governance&amp;rdquo; strategy.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the RAI, Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s system also has a second token, FLX, the &amp;ldquo;ungovernance&amp;rdquo; token. It is used for system governance and also serves as a last resort liquidity mechanism (in case of bad debt), with a system quite similar to Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FLX token can be purchased on the market, but it is mostly &lt;strong&gt;distributed to the main actors involved in the system&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.reflexer.finance/earn/incentives&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the exhaustive list of FLX incentives&lt;/a&gt; is available on the Reflexer website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are eligible for FLX (claimable on the Reflexer website, monthly distribution) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safes owners who bring their RAI in liquidity on the UNIv2 ETH/RAI pair (migration in progress, end soon) or UNIv3 RAI/DAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But also the liquidity providers on FLX/ETH (migration in progress, end soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally the FLX stakers in the equivalent of the Safety Module at Reflexer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also incentives in FLX related to the use of RAI in various DeFi services, detailed in the last part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.reflexer.finance/incentives/flx-staking&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FLX staking (Uni V2 FLX/ETH)&lt;/a&gt; serves as both an incentive mechanism to provide liquidity as well as a guarantee for the system. If the system is under-collateralized, the stakers will be diluted (-&amp;gt;token LP liquidated) so that the module acquires RAI and brings the system back to equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a normal situation, the stakers simply enjoy a rather attractive return. Just like Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module, this module has a time limit for unstake, to avoid liquidity drain in critical periods: it is 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the basics on FLX, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss its long-term issues a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gouvernance-exit-plan&#34;&gt;The gouvernance exit plan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reflexer system is intended to be &amp;ldquo;governance-minimized&amp;rdquo;. This has been the case since its inception, since decisions that are made by governance in Maker (Stability Fee of vaults) are automated in Reflexer (PID controller).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision is simply to automate everything that can be automated in the long term, once the system is mature, and to give the keys to the subsystems that cannot be automated to the FLX holder community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has set three main levels related to this objective &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;detailed in the FLX presentation article&lt;/a&gt;. Each level is linked to a date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 months after launch - April 17, 2022: minimization of governance on the main subsystems (liquidation, auction and taxation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18 months after launch - August 17, 2022: minimization of governance on all main contracts, except for the PID controller, oracles and the Savior mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd step (date incoming): handover (to FLX holdeurs) of the remaining mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this overview is enough to understand the interest of RAI and how it works. So let&amp;rsquo;s see how RAI is already used in various DeFi protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-defi-ecosystem-around-rai&#34;&gt;The DeFi ecosystem around RAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAI is gradually being adopted within the DeFi ecosystem, and that&amp;rsquo;s great to see! So I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a quick overview of the different RAI integrations in DeFi protocols, starting with money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-fuse-rari-capital&#34;&gt;RAI on Fuse (Rari Capital)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuse is a rather innovative money market since it allows the creation of pools by players who are not the team, and eventually anyone. It is therefore quite logical that Fuse was one of the first money markets to support RAI. Depending on the pool, it is also possible to &lt;strong&gt;use RAI as collateral on Fuse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAI is currently available in 3 asset pools with different risk levels and borrowable tokens:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-aave&#34;&gt;RAI on Aave
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding support for RAI already a few weeks ago, Aave recently allocated a (very moderate) amount of StkAAVE to incentivize borrowing and depositing on RAI. It was necessary to shed light on one of the main contradictions of the platform: Aave is a decentralized money market that (still) uses the vast majority of its budget to encourage borrowing/deposits on stablecoins that are not stablecoins at all (USDC and USDT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: for the moment &lt;strong&gt;the max LTV of RAI is 0: RAI cannot be used as collateral on Aave&lt;/strong&gt;. No discrimination here, this is pretty standard on Aave&amp;rsquo;s part - this is the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; and prudent procedure when adding a new type of collateral. Governance can vote to increase this value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-cream&#34;&gt;RAI on Cream
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cream was one of the first money markets to support RAI. However, it is an extremely risky and non-value-added, even deleterious, second-tier money market over the long term. So I&amp;rsquo;ll stop there, and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;invite you to read this article if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai-on-idle-finance&#34;&gt;RAI on Idle Finance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idle Finance is a service that allows, as the name suggests, to set up passive return strategies. In the case of RAI, Idle leverages the returns available on Fuse as well as Aave. Initially, there was also Cream but the governance chose to refocus the strategies to contain the risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the native RAI return, a deposit on Idle Finance also allows you to benefit from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a FLX output, visible here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A StkAAVE yield (corresponding to the share of RAI deployed on Aave)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, also a yield in IDLE (soon - voted by the governance but not yet implemented)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to own RAI over the long term to hedge against dollar/euro risks, the Idle deposit is rather attractive to produce a totally passive return. Be careful though, this means compounding several smart contract risks: Reflexer + Aave + Fuse + Idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rai--fei-protocol&#34;&gt;RAI + Fei Protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fei is another stablecoin that seeks to maximize decentralization. Here the approach is different and is essentially based on the notion of Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). In short, the bulk of liquidity in EIF pairs is controlled by the protocol itself. The funds come from the genesis of the protocol where users have committed ETH in order to acquire FEI as well as TRIBE (governance token) at their creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a stablecoin that shares a characteristic with RAI and LUSD: it is fully collateralized by trustless assets (ETH). Nevertheless, FEI is much closer to LUSD than to RAI in the sense that it remains pegged to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Fei DAO voted to &lt;strong&gt;diversify some of the protocol cash flow to RAI&lt;/strong&gt; to make it more sustainable. Thus, up to $6M (~2M RAI) will be acquired and deployed on Aave and Fuse to produce a return.  Other DAOs are also considering diversifying some of their cash to RAI (Moloch, DxDAO, Metagame, etc.), so I expect more similar initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things from this fairly comprehensive presentation of RAI. As always, keep in mind that I choose my topics carefully and this article is not intended as investment advice. In this case, Reflexer/RAI was chosen here because it is an elegant system whose analysis allows to discuss many essential notions to better understand DeFi as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that reading this article has been informative for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/aave-governance-program/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/aave-governance-platform/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Calling for your support to keep Aave&#39;s governance community-driven" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m TokenBrice, and this post is my formal platform to solicit delegation in the Aave governance. While calling for delegations and explaining my vision for Aave, I&amp;rsquo;d also like to set a new standard for DAO delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find in the post details about my long-term vision for Aave, who I am, why I&amp;rsquo;m asking for your AAVE vote delegations today, as well as all relevant disclosures to help you make sure this responsibility is not conflicting or overlapping with any other ongoing ones I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find my vote delegate disclosure, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ErichDylus/Open-Source-Law/blob/main/forms/legal/Vote%20Delegate%20Disclosure.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-me-why-now-why-aave&#34;&gt;Why me, why now, why Aave?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been actively involved in the growth of DeFi, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actively committed to get involved in DAO&amp;rsquo;s politics. However, the recent developments in the space led me to believe that now more than ever, the community needs to come together and offer credible governance alternatives to the existing structures, mostly enabled by venture capitalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my early involvement in DeFi, I have fought to maximize accessibility and make sure the fundamentals of DeFi (transparency, trustlessness, permissionlessness &amp;amp; open-source) are preserved as the ecosystem grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now ready to uphold this vision at the Aave DAO level with an active participation in the governance. After reading &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards/4852&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the first proposal for the extension of the liquidity mining program&lt;/a&gt; on Aave, I realized that we needed to be proactive and lead the efforts for a counter-proposal if we do not want more structured, organized and better funded interest groups to make the decisions for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical decisions for major protocols are increasingly decided by a limited number of participants sharing similar interests, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-janus.md#uniswap-1m-uni-here-1m-uni-there&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s DeFi Education Fund vote&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to at least try to prevent a similar scenario from unfolding on Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-vision-for-aave&#34;&gt;My vision for Aave
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets are at the heart of DeFi. I think Aave established itself as both the most innovative and secure service available in the vertical, and the observed track record aligns with this view. Relative to other money markets, Aave managed to so far avoid any failure resulting in loss of funds for users (others did not). If that was to happen, thanks to the Safety Module, affected users could be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the liquidity mining extension, the ongoing proposal that motivated me to get more involved in the governance, my main concerns are the sizable budget currently proposed (27% of the total ecosystem reserve for a year) &amp;amp; the fact that it is allocated &amp;ldquo;blindly&amp;rdquo; based on set budget per assets with no other adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now calling for delegation to thrive to uphold the following principles in Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrive to provide comprehensive breakdowns of the challenges pertaining to the main votes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight to ensure that the Ecosystem Reserve is used in the best long-term interest of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate key concepts and ideas voiced by the community to make sure they are answered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a documented and motivated position for each main issue, with a particular attention given their impact on the protocol&amp;rsquo;s safety and resiliency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use, as much as possible, my existing network and presence to document Aave&amp;rsquo;s governance and make it more accessible, particularly to FR-speaking audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-delegate&#34;&gt;How to delegate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Sybil.org to check your voting power on various DAOs and handle delegations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Sybil.org - Aave&lt;/a&gt;: once you connect your wallet you&amp;rsquo;ll see your voting power on the right panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can self-delegate to use that voting power yourself (default) or delegate it to another wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wish to delegate your voting power to me, simply delegate to &lt;code&gt;tokenbrice.eth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following DeFi since before it bore its name and experimented with all the landmark protocols. With Mounir (ParaSwap) &amp;amp; Arthur, we created the DeFi France movement and helped it grow. I keep up with DeFi on a daily basis and share my research on a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://tokenbrice.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FR/EN blog&lt;/a&gt;, and host &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/tokenbrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 weekly live sessions&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the latest developments in DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of French-speaking Aave team members, we produced what is widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive resources covering the protocol in French: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSL0JbBxvRM&amp;amp;list=PLreQl_vxgtPh-13wNlEWui7RTioCOFweN&amp;amp;index=2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 the Aave marathon (3h)&lt;/a&gt; with Marc Zeller, Alex &amp;amp; Statelayer. After the publication of a comprehensive &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇺🇸 guide helping users to assess risks on money markets&lt;/a&gt;, Alex also joined me for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L9DiHOouaY&amp;amp;list=PLreQl_vxgtPhSZeMiTbzXAjL_U-_NnQwD&amp;amp;index=23&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🇫🇷 another live session dedicated to risk assessment for money markets &amp;amp; her job as actuary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the media I control (this blog), I enforced some basic principles which I think give insight as to where I stand and what matters for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy-preservation&lt;/strong&gt;: the data collection is minimal and done using a self-hosted open-source service (Matomo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: the website is static &amp;amp; optimized to the best of my ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: the content lives in a github repo, all edits are publicly logged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including transparent funding&lt;/strong&gt;: the only source of funding accepted for this activity is the related &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/811/tokenbrice-evangelizing-defi-in-fr-en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;gitcoin grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Aave as a protocol here for the decades to come and will fight to make sure the DAO keeps a long-term focus. While the ecosystem reserve are significant, the current burn rate will empty them in a few years, for ~ $50M worth of stablecoins accrued in the protocol reserves (extrapolating the current rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my engagement in Aave governance started with the discussion on the liquidity mining program, I believe several other adjustments are also needed to maximize its long-term resiliency such as updates to the safety module budget and mechanisms, as well as a diversification of the protocol&amp;rsquo;s treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to participate in the governance of Aave, whether by proposing, voting, abstaining, or engaging in related discourse or otherwise, in accordance with its applicable parameters and guidelines. I understand that other externally owned accounts and addresses may delegate their voting power to me from time to time and intend that this disclosure will generally govern my actions as a delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have instituted policies and procedures with respect to delegations in the interest of transparency, which may be subject to update from time to time and are available here. Though I do not have a formal policy, in participating in the governance of Aave, I intend to act on the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will seek to remain informed about governance proposals and vote on matters from time to time using my independent judgment unless otherwise disclosed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will act in good faith and use reasonable care in participating in governance, including in making proposals and in voting;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will endeavor to provide transparent, good faith, and honest information as to my motivations and reasoning in carrying out my role as a delegate, or when soliciting the delegation of voting power;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not a party to any voting bloc, trust, or other group and will not engage in vote-buying, vote-selling, bribery, manipulation, or other undisclosed vote solicitation or coordination; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the extent I am aware of a material non-public conflict of interest that exists for a Delegator with respect to a proposal, I will refrain from voting in my capacity as a delegate for such Delegator with respect to such proposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conflict-disclosure&#34;&gt;Conflict Disclosure
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I currently have economic interest in ParaSwap (part-time contributor), and may engage in the DeFi France community from time to time. I may have direct or indirect economic interests in the various projects, entities, networks, and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time, including but not limited to ETH, CRV, CVX, LINK, LQTY, BAL, PNK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as disclosed herein, in participating in the governance of Aave, I am not acting on behalf of ParaSwap nor on behalf of any client, nor any voting power delegator, whether or not such delegation was solicited. If my views expressed in governance contexts are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me as a vote delegate or otherwise, nor will there be any coverage or indemnity from any applicable insurance or similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disclaimer-of-duty-to-update&#34;&gt;Disclaimer of Duty to Update
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date, nor of adjusting these disclosures for each applicable governance process, but will endeavor to act in good faith when soliciting the delegation of voting power and when acting in my capacity as a delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may contact me at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;mailto:me@tokenbrice.com&#34; &gt;me@tokenbrice.com&lt;/a&gt;, though I assume no duty for, and cannot guarantee my responsiveness to, or any action upon, any individual question, feedback, or request from a vote delegator or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Janus: the new sworn enemy of DeFi protocols?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-janus/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-janus/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/defi-janus-cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post Janus: the new sworn enemy of DeFi protocols?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mythology is often used to illustrate DeFi. For example, the Canaanite god Moloch is often mentioned to symbolize coordination issues. Today, I will identify with you a new deity from the DeFi pantheon: Janus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we analyze the mechanisms of open governance of DeFi protocols that can lead to the emergence of a new kind of challenge for DeFi, a sworn enemy that I propose to you to embody in the Roman deity Janus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the two-faced god, &lt;strong&gt;a Janus protocol suffers from a deep ambivalence&lt;/strong&gt;: although it can be an unquestionable success in terms of use, it faces serious antagonisms between its various stakeholders who involve the sustainability of the protocol (users, holders, investors, team and extended community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the Janus, you have to understand the inherent complexity of DeFi and how it can accommodate &lt;strong&gt;consensus on decisions that are deleterious or not optimal&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the context is set, we can analyze three Janus, each in their own way: MakerDAO, Yearn Finance and Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;complexity-and-governance-issues-fertile-ground-for-janus&#34;&gt;Complexity and governance issues: fertile ground for Janus
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of Janus protocols in the current situation is due to many factors that are difficult to prioritize. I have grouped them into three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;governance-and-voting-mechanisms&#34;&gt;Governance and voting mechanisms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governance of DeFi protocols takes place &lt;strong&gt;in an open and transparent&lt;/strong&gt; way, in several stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During discussions on different media such as Discord, the community converges on different ideas that can lead to proposals. Proposals are formalized, usually on governance forums and amended before reaching &lt;strong&gt;informal consensus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signaling&lt;/strong&gt; mechanisms (Snapshot) make it possible to identify the most relevant proposals. They are then &lt;strong&gt;submitted to the vote of the token holders&lt;/strong&gt; via the main governance mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most governance systems still operate on the logic of &lt;strong&gt;1 token = 1 vote&lt;/strong&gt;, thus assigning the same weight to all token holders regardless of their attitude towards the project or level of commitment by compared to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measure the influence in the governance of DeFi protocols -&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Lsquaredleland/status/1411031620748943360&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some protocols have succeeded in challenging this approach by adding a logic of time commitment: interacting with Curve&amp;rsquo;s DAO requires engaging its CRVs for a period ranging from 1 to 4 years. A long-term commitment increases the effective voting power obtained (vCRV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;strong&gt;participation is generally low&lt;/strong&gt;, even when delegation mechanisms are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;complexity-of-decisions&#34;&gt;Complexity of decisions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate governance proposals for a decentralized finance protocol, one must have &lt;strong&gt;an understanding of a whole set of basics relating to Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;, blockchain and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, ideally, you need a thorough understanding of the protocol in question, as well as its &lt;strong&gt;interactions with other protocols, synergies&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. We can also now add to this all the additional complexity linked to the multiplication of scalability solutions: sidechains and L2.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the formulation of proposals on governance forums is generally quite technical, which &lt;strong&gt;makes their understanding&lt;/strong&gt; difficult and opens the door to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, governance suffers from a real mass effect: as protocols develop, the amount of information to digest to have an informed vote increases accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the MakerDAO governance forum estimated his weekly monitoring and participation work to be around 40 hours per week, steadily increasing:

&lt;h3 id=&#34;governance-supports&#34;&gt;Governance supports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although governance is open and transparent, &lt;strong&gt;it still often relies on various proprietary services and therefore administered&lt;/strong&gt;, most often by the team itself. This causes serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So governance-related discussions are usually done on Discord and the Governance Forum - both &lt;strong&gt;mediums are usually moderated directly by the project team&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team may have &lt;strong&gt;control over reporting mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://snapshot.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt;. The accumulation of all these limitations of decentralized governance systems can lead to situations observed recently, where token owners do not vote in their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick tour of the current limits of governance systems was necessary to have the context for what follows. So let&amp;rsquo;s see the three Janus that I spotted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uniswap-1m-uni-here-1m-uni-there&#34;&gt;Uniswap: 1M UNI here, 1M UNI there
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;proposal-05-in-summary&#34;&gt;Proposal 05 in summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rushed vote which resulted in the signing of an almost blank check from 1M UNI for a group of legal directors of large decentralized projects responsible for deploying a DeFI lobbying strategy. Very few transparency mechanisms have been deployed and the influence of the UNI holder community on the funded group is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-005-defi-education-fund/12963&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Proposition 05 Uniswap Gouvernance - DeFi Education Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compression-of-governance&#34;&gt;Compression of governance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Uniswap, it was all there. It all started with a rushed vote as members of the community had &lt;strong&gt;many, many questions ignored&lt;/strong&gt;. The community is concerned about the lack of control over the funds allocated without any conditions. Chris Blec has gathered the main questions and concerns in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1409857319144394758&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; and managed to get some responses from the team in a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://odysee.com/@ChrisBlec:8/chrisblec-june24-twitterspace:9?r=DeLsAYctGhcLFvkGBKYgE2tN17fUXA9u&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Twitter space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;strong&gt;the organization that will receive the 1M UNI is made up of close members of the Uniswap team&lt;/strong&gt; and project investors such as a16z are also suspected of having been decisive in the adoption of the decision. The proposal also had direct support from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 17 edit: quickly after receiving the funds, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/sale-of-usdc-raises-concerns-regarding-newly-formed-defi-education-fund/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the multisig sold half of the total balance (500 000 UNI)&lt;/a&gt; for USDC, currently sitting idle in the wallet - not even farming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the proposal wants to be broader than Uniswap since they are officially mandated to lobby DeFi, but we can ask the question of the vision of DeFi carried by such profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transparency-maybe-control-hell-no-&#34;&gt;Transparency? Maybe. Control? Hell no !
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the reactions to the first iterations of the proposal, different mechanisms have been added to bring more transparency to the actions of the DeFi Education Fund. The team is also committed to implementing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/withtally/safeguard&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FailSafe&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible. This would allow the DAO (UNI holders) to be able to exercise a veto on the transactions carried out by the multisig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However at the present time &lt;strong&gt;the effective control of the DAO remains limited&lt;/strong&gt;: the vote has passed and the 1M UNI are now allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode corresponds for me to the equivalent of an embezzlement of public funds, except that here the funds come from a DAO. The adventure and its adventures also shed light on the effective power exercised by the various stakeholders in the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;makerdao-imbalance-of-competing-interests&#34;&gt;MakerDAO: imbalance of competing interests
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Maker is more general and goes back much further. It is a common problem in DeFi of aligning the divergent interests of different participants. In addition, to respond quickly to the growing demand for DAI, &lt;strong&gt;the multiplication of collateral (MCD update) has greatly impacted the trustlessness and effective decentralization of DAI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 60% of DAI collateral is tokens that require some form of trust like USDC, wBTC or TUSD. The problem has been around for a long time and is not going to be resolved, if ever. I have already discussed this problem on this blog, I refer you to this article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abusive-user-fees&#34;&gt;Abusive user fees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we will rather dig into the problem of excessive fees which illustrates &lt;strong&gt;a classic case of rent maximization on customers thought to be captive&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DAI being a synthetic stablecoin struck directly by the user, its annual borrowing fees should not exceed 2-3% and this is still costly. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt;, an alternative to Maker, charges 0.5% annually fees on borrowed LUSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the last update, the main maker ETH vault (ETH-A) was charging 5.5% annual fees. It&amp;rsquo;s now down to 3.5%, but the fees on the vault closest to Liquity&amp;rsquo;s borrowing conditions (ETH-B, minimum collateralization = 130% // 110% on Liquity) remains at 9% annually, or &lt;strong&gt;18 times more expensive than its alternative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-annuity-for-mkr-holders&#34;&gt;An annuity for MKR holders?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakerDAO fees are usually high, even though they&amp;rsquo;ve been at zero or close for short periods of time to stimulate demand. So &lt;strong&gt;why does the DAO Maker systematically vote excessive fees&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is as simple as 1 + 1 = 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees taken from Maker vaults are used to buy MKR tokens in the markets and burn them, making the MKR token rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are voted by Maker&amp;rsquo;s DAO, in proportion to the MKR tokens owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very design of the protocol thus encourages MKR owners to vote for &lt;strong&gt;extracting the maximum fees tolerated by users&lt;/strong&gt;, and not a penny less. Indeed, each base point &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in additional costs translates into more MKR burned and therefore a priori a capital which is appreciated for the owners of the token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound fabulous in terms of tokenomics because it optimizes for the best possible price on MKR (theoretically), but &lt;strong&gt;it is done to the detriment of the users of the service&lt;/strong&gt; that the platform offers - and therefore goes against the long-term interest- term of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also keep in mind that unlike most protocols, Maker has never implemented a mechanism to turn its users into holders (liquidity mining). So I hardly see how Maker can be competitive with such a structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ambiguous-case-of-yearn-finance&#34;&gt;The ambiguous case of Yearn Finance
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is arguably the simplest and most straightforward example of a Janus. In barely a year, Yearn has become a &lt;strong&gt;major DeFi protocol with $ 4B in assets deposited&lt;/strong&gt; and above all &lt;strong&gt;delusional profitability&lt;/strong&gt; that the team likes to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the story is not so rosy depending on your perspective. We are therefore going to study Yearn&amp;rsquo;s situation from 3 angles: from a user&amp;rsquo;s point of view, for another protocol and for the Yearn DAO itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crazy-fees-for-users&#34;&gt;Crazy fees for users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s success comes at what cost? Again, essentially &lt;strong&gt;users who are literally being robbed by Yearn&lt;/strong&gt; - fees are among the highest seen for a DeFi asset manager, yet complex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearn takes &lt;strong&gt;2% annual management fee on the entire deposit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearn also takes a 20% performance fee: 20% of all farmed assets go into cash. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first charge is the most problematic since it means that Yearn&amp;rsquo;s excessively greedy charges lead to vaults that… lose money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, any vault that does not achieve a minimum of 2% annual return on Yearn ends up in the red once the management fees are taken, without even taking into account the performance fees &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protocol-side-yearns-hug-of-death&#34;&gt;Protocol side: Yearn&amp;rsquo;s hug of Death
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn allows its users to farm different protocols like Curve by automatically managing the composition of their yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is practical for the user, but it also means that ** Yearn systematically sells all the tokens farmed ** by his vaults: we can therefore ask the question of the impact and relevance for the farmed protocol, which is therefore under selling pressure on its native token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Convex has shown that a better structured protocol in terms of tokenomics and specific to Curve can offer a synergistic alternative where the returns are much higher, while avoiding the systematic sale of farmed tokens. I analyze the Convex &amp;ldquo;flywheel&amp;rdquo; in this article:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/defi-flywheel.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereby, it confronted Yearn with its contradictions and Yearn essentially capitulated by integrating Convex to optimize the performance of its vaults. This now means that &lt;strong&gt;Yearn users pay a fee to Convex and help the protocol accumulate more VeCRV&lt;/strong&gt; and thus widen its gap with Yearn - checkmate for Yearn on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;concerning-yearn-dao&#34;&gt;Concerning Yearn DAO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this rather worrying fundamental situation since Yearn now offers &lt;strong&gt;essentially non-competitive products&lt;/strong&gt; (all Curve vaults), Yearn presents itself as one of the undeniable successes of DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the team seems to measure the success of the protocol by the volume of fees collected by it. The indicator is obviously dangerous since with the management fees at 2% per year, any deposit in Yearn systematically pays fees even if little or no profit is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than taking the fees charged as an indicator and therefore a measure of success, the protocol could be optimized on the basis of the profits generated for depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and even if it is a more subjective topic, the communication around the project is muddled or even almost disturbing at times, for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedefiant.io/yearn-revenues-projected-to-surpass-tradfis-fueled-by-thriving-community/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;when Yearn is compared&lt;/a&gt; to traditional asset managers like WealthFront or BlackRock - I find that quite unbalanced since Yearn charges similar fees to these structures but operates in a much more dynamic market. In addition, are such companies really relevant models to have in DeFi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-janus/yearn-comp.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;yearn-comp&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yearn compares to asset managers, it may be because the comparison with its DeFi peers is clear:

		alt=&#34;defi-asset-manager&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, where Convex works to allow cvxCRV holders to vote in decisions of the DAO Curve, Yearn is taking control over the voting power associated with CRVs deposited by its users on the yveCRV. The same approach can be observed with the airdrops allocated to VeCRV holders: Yearn grants them to buy CRVs and sponsor their yveCRV vault, while Convex makes them accessible to its depositors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-the-janus-defensible&#34;&gt;Are the Janus defensible?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have set the scene with three Janus, the question of their defendability remains. All three have credible alternatives, often more recent and with more balanced tokenomics. So let&amp;rsquo;s see how our Janus evolve in relation to these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just two months of existence, Convex has already surpassed Yearn in terms of the total value of assets deposited. So far, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s feedback has failed to turn the tide, and I think &lt;strong&gt;only a major overhaul of the model will allow the protocol to remain competitive in the long run&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless &lt;strong&gt;the machine is launched&lt;/strong&gt;: Convex already has more than twice as many CRVs as Yearn and accumulates more quickly. And even though Yearn has lots of other protocols, it seems unlikely to me that he will ever be able to compete again on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Marker side, more and more people are starting to point out the absurdity of the current situation on DAI, and the alternatives are gaining ground. In a few weeks and with only ETH as accepted collateral, Liquity has already attracted the equivalent of more than 40% of the total value deposited in MakerDAO:

		alt=&#34;tokenterminal-tvl-maker-liquity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Liquity, borrowing costs are much lower, clearer, and distributed directly to LQTY stakers. The service is thus more open and participatory than MakerDAO while being brutally more efficient. Here again, I think a major overhaul of MakerDAO would be necessary for the protocol to regain its relevance and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for Uniswap, the competition is even fiercer. The protocol is evolving in the face of mature tokenomics like Curve, which has a protocol revenue sharing mechanism active for almost a year, while nothing is yet offered on UNI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all three fronts, I think the situation will force Uniswap, Maker and Yearn to renew themselves. However, with the pace of the industry, the noose is tightening and their more open, efficient and synergistic alternatives are rapidly gaining ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the DAOs of the three protocols fell out of sync with their users, the latter reminded them where their interests lay in the simplest and most effective way we know of: with consistent capital movement. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what happens next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI is still seen by many as a decentralized stablecoin that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require trust, although it no longer does. There are still few stablecoins that rely only on trustless (ETH) and credibly decentralized (or on track) collateral: I know of two - Liquity&amp;rsquo;s LUSD and Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/defi-flywheel/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/defi-flywheel/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/defi-flywheel-cover-en.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎡 DeFi Flywheel : engineering protocol to protocol synergies through tokens" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three weeks, the Convex protocol attracted over $3 billion in deposits, while becoming the largest 🐳 whale of CRV, today and probably forever. Luck is never a negligible factor, but with such a smashing entry into DeFi top protocols, we must look much further. Indeed, the key to understanding the meteoric rise of Convex is tokenomics, and this is our topic of the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, besides the technical, you also have to be a fine sociologist, or rather a &amp;ldquo;game theorist&amp;rdquo; as we say around here: to know how to anticipate the reactions of crowds to a given set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of liquidity mining programs last year showed that the right set of rules can move huge amounts of capital. The question now is how to do it wisely, i.e. with an awareness of what is at stake &lt;strong&gt;in the long run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, liquidity mining by itself only attracts &lt;strong&gt;mercenary and opportunistic deposits&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, liquidity mining is more a tool to make a project known than to perpetuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To last in DeFi, it is a matter of tokenomics: i.e. the mechanics of the native tokens of protocols. &lt;strong&gt;Tokenomics is in a way the gameplay of a DeFi protocol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I am a big fan of the CRV model. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect, since the game around the CRV token has never been as lively as it has been in the last few weeks. Some people even talk about #lockening to describe &lt;strong&gt;the race to accumulate CRVs&lt;/strong&gt; that Convex, Yearn and StakeDAO are engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go into details to understand the concept of flywheel with the example of Convex / Curve. I will finish by analyzing protocols that could be used in a similar scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rise-of-the-first--defi-flywheel&#34;&gt;The rise of the first 🎡 DeFi flywheel
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of Convex, a new term began to be used to describe its operation and tokenomics: 🎡 flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a precise definition yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try one: it describes a protocol that achieves a winning trifecta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tokenomics that offers interesting opportunities to token owners optimistic about the future of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A protocol that is itself relevant and meets a real need, ideally in direct synergy with another protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A liquidity mining program (+airdrop) to start the loop and attract the first token owners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generalized the Convex model, but it has an additional feature: Convex is a kind of &amp;ldquo;meta-protocol&amp;rdquo;: it is &lt;strong&gt;built entirely on top of Curve Finance and in synergy with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the forerunner of the flywheel would probably be found among protocols built in synergy with others. For example, although it is built on top of BSC and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rekt.news/pancakebunny-rekt/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;suffered a significant attack recently&lt;/a&gt;, the Bunny protocol helped the DEX PancakeSwap to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunny offers to manage Pancake liquidity provider positions, while issuing its own token based on the returns generated. This simplifies the management of liquidity providers positions on Pancake while generating an additional source of return (BUNNY token).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to fully understand the concept of 🎡 flywheel, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the best one we&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to see so far: Convex. It turns out to be a bit more complicated because it relies on Curve, so you first need to understand the curve tokenomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crv-a-tokenomics-for--flywheels&#34;&gt;CRV: a tokenomics for 🎡 flywheels?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve Finance&amp;rsquo;s tokenomics is almost a year old and yet it is still often misunderstood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great elegance of the CRV tokenomics resides in &lt;strong&gt;aligning the interests of several actors better than any other tokenomics known to date&lt;/strong&gt;: the liquidity providers, the CRV holders and the Curve protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the model tends over time to merge the two populations (CRV holders and LP) through two mechanics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity providers are incensitivised in CRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRV stakers (VeCRV holders) can &amp;ldquo;boost&amp;rdquo; the CRV yield of their liquidity provision on Curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model creates an interesting path for protocol users, who are &lt;strong&gt;strongly encouraged to make a long-term commitment&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, locking CRVs into VeCRVs becomes more and more efficient the longer the commitment is - the maximum being 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, I invite you to read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakecapital.substack.com/p/curve-tokenomics-and-first-mover&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/crv-tokenomics.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;crv-tokenomics&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the CRV model also has its limitations, the most obvious one being the impact of Ethereum transaction fees: large sums of money can be required for the game to start making sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, for a long time now, the biggest contributors of liquidity on Curve have not been users but &lt;strong&gt;other protocols&lt;/strong&gt;. Pooling funds reduces the impact of gas fees while potentially developing a VeCRV accumulation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, various solutions have emerged to &lt;strong&gt;manage liquidity positions on Curve&lt;/strong&gt;, the best known being Yearn, but there are also Harvest and StakeDAO. While they can be useful for depositors, they suffer from two major limitations: high management fees and a parasitic approach. Yearn, Harvest or StakeDAO immediately sell any farmed tokens. This results in increasing selling pressure on the native token of the protocols used to produce the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-convex-model--the-first-flywheel-&#34;&gt;The Convex model : the first flywheel 🎡
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Convex way to operate offers a &amp;ldquo;Yearn-like&amp;rdquo; service  to liquidity providers on Curve: automated management of their position to maximize returns. Like Yearn, Convex has a VeCRV accumulation strategy to maximize the return of depositors in CRV through the boost mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the underlying approach is totally different from Yearn and is part of a virtuous synergy with Curve :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No systematic selling&lt;/strong&gt;: unlike Yearn, Convex does not sell the tokens it farms. Liquidity providers are thus remunerated in CRV but also in CVX, the native token of Convex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fees collected by Convex are 100% dedicated to the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, while Yearn for example pays strategists - obviously quite redundant on a simple strategy like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the distribution of the collected fees, Convex creates two &lt;strong&gt;interesting staking opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; to compose its returns, detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;the liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; on the token that represents a CRV in Convex (CvxCRV) is more optimal than the Yearn equivalent: CvxCRV trades in a pool directly against the CRV, with an incentive program in CVX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fees--the-lifeblood-of-success&#34;&gt;Fees : the lifeblood of success
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the fee structure is key to get what has happened with Convex. The protocol now controls over 32M VeCRVs, which is &lt;strong&gt;almost twice Yearn&amp;rsquo;s total, and that&amp;rsquo;s just after three weeks of existence&lt;/strong&gt;.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/convex-curve-stats.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;convex-curve-stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convex charges a total fee of 16% on all CRVs farmed on the protocol (compared to 20/2 on all tokens for Yearn, or 30% for Harvest for example). Of the 16%, 1% is used to cover operational costs such as the gas cost of collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/convex-synergies-CRV-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;convex-synergies-CRV&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is the redistribution of the remaining 15%, i.e. 15% of all CRVs farmed by Convex (&lt;strong&gt;over 400,000 CRVs per day&lt;/strong&gt; You can view the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi/pools?see=0x989aeb4d175e16225e39e87d0d97a3360524ad80&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Convex Curve position via CurveMarketCap here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two staker populations are eligible for this juicy pie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% is paid back to CvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt; stakers, in CRV, in addition to their return in 3pool and CVX tokens (+airdrops VeCRV holder). Owning CvxCRV becomes much more attractive than VeCRV for a simple depositor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5% is returned to the CVX stakers&lt;/strong&gt;, in the form of CvxCRV. This means that 5% of all CRVs farmed by Convex are captured and locked within the protocol. This mechanically increases the pool of VeCRVs even if no third party CRV deposits are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The situation is still ongoing and there are still surprising gaps: for example, at the time of writing (June 07) the total capitalization of the CVX token is not even half of the value of the CRVs that the protocol has ($30M vs $80M). I think the situation will harmonize in the long run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-anticipate-the-next-flywheels&#34;&gt;How to anticipate the next flywheels?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some notions about Curve and an analysis of the flywheel 🎡 Convex, we now have the cards in hand to venture into the game of foresight. Before that however I propose instead to go look into the past to analyze an almost failed flywheel : Pickle Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pickle-finance--the-wrong-timing&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance : the wrong timing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, Pickle has all the makings of a flywheel: it is a system to increase the returns on Yearn deposits through the additional issue of PICKLE tokens. PICKLE has elements of the VeCRV system, with a locking mechanism (DILL) that allows to boost PICKLE returns on deposits on Pickle Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that&amp;hellip; Pickle does not technically add anything to Yearn, apart from issuing PICKLE. Moreover, Pickle does not specialize: farms are offered on Yearn vaults but also some Sushi pairs. Unlike Convex, Pickle is therefore not able to develop a unique advantage (moat) on farmed services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, nothing is definitive. Pickle&amp;rsquo;s situation could evolve, if the tokenomics of the underlying protocols (YFI and SUSHI) evolve. Both protocols seem to be moving towards a reappropriation of the VeCRV model, so it is quite possible. A model that combines the Adamant/Ellipsis burn logic and the Curve boosting has even been proposed for Sushi: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;oSUSHI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;veYFI&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adamant-finance---a-flywheel-on-polygons-lp-&#34;&gt;Adamant Finance : 🎡 a flywheel on Polygon&amp;rsquo;s LP ?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adamant is a still new protocol that exists on the Polygon sidechain. It allows the easy management of liquidity positions on the main exchange services: QuickSwap, Cometh, SushiSwap, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to automatic compounding of returns, Adamant also offers additional ADDY rewards (based on profits generated). All ADDY earned are vested (locked) for 3 months and can be withdrawn earlier with a 50% penalty. This is redistributed to those who agree to staker + lock their ADDY for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all ADDY stakers (even vested ones) benefit from a share of the fees collected by the platform, distributed in wMATIC. The protocol thus has a tokenomics already quite elaborate with different retention mechanisms, but it still has some improvements to find to become a flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one would be to introduce a greater incentive to lock in ADDYs through a boost system similar to Curve. Depositors with ADDYs in stake+lock will have a better return in ADDYs on their LP position. This is already under discussion or even in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adamant still has to develop a synergy with the farmed protocols as strong as Convex with Curve. This is difficult or impossible for the moment because none of them have tokenomics as subtle as CRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-x-liquity-service---money-market-flywheel&#34;&gt;An &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; Liquity service : 🎡 money market flywheel
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have discussed flywheels built on decentralized exchange services, which seems the most obvious. Nevertheless, we can consider similar models on other types of services, like money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I propose to finish with a theoretical flywheel of my own. To my knowledge, such a protocol does not exist yet: it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic equation is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong demand for &amp;ldquo;ETH passive&amp;rdquo; products - products that develop strategies on ETH in order to accumulate ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to borrow stablecoins using ETH as collateral. This way, stablecoins can earn an additional return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this strategy, Liquity would be &lt;strong&gt;the platform of choice without question&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the cost of borrowing is the lowest in the market (almost 12x cheaper than Maker over a year) and there is no shortage of opportunities for yield on the LUSD stablecoin.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/defi-flywheel/protocole-x-liquity-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;protocole-x-liquity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of such a pooled strategy is to &lt;strong&gt;manage the collateralization ratio&lt;/strong&gt; and to be able to balance it quickly if the market moves. Here again, Liquity lends itself well to this since the stability pool offers an attractive return on the LUSD while allowing &lt;strong&gt;the rapid mobilization of LUSD to repay the debt if necessary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The X protocol in question would offer &lt;strong&gt;a passive ETH investment product&lt;/strong&gt; for users who would not have to manage the position themselves. We can also consider that the X protocol has its own token with a tokenomics that addresses one of the main dangers of the strategy: the lack of predictability. Thus the native token of protocol X could be used to encourage long deposits of a predictable duration (users lock their ETH over 3/6/9/12 months for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term commitments also allow to &lt;strong&gt;develop a strategy on the LQTY farmed by the LUSDs.&lt;/strong&gt; By committing ETH for one year in the protocol for example, the user will be able to claim a portion of the LQTYs farmed by the whole protocol, and benefited, for life, from the LUSDs and ETHs they generate. The synergy of the protocol with Liquity as well as the long term returns are maximized if protocol X does not sell any LQTY, as is the case in the concept proposed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will help you better understand what has been going on with Convex, Yearn and Curve over the past few weeks and use the lessons learned from this episode to identify similar opportunities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about different incentive mechanisms is that they precede action. In game theory, there are no certainties, but some behaviors are almost mechanical - for those who really understand incentives and their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself !&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/money-market-recipes/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/money-market-recipes-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 🌽 Defi money markets cookbook" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this blog, I frequently discuss about money markets and assets market in DeFi. Basically, they allow you to &lt;strong&gt;loan and borrow tokens&lt;/strong&gt;. These two actions have become like &lt;strong&gt;deFi verbs&lt;/strong&gt;: they are used directly or indirectly in almost every strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it is crucial to understand the protocols you are using and especially &lt;strong&gt;the different &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;money market risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Today, I would like to focus on the why and the how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which strategies can be implemented using money markets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can they be deployed in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to break down different &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; to take advantage of the money markets. Take these recipes as &lt;strong&gt;inspiration to develop your own strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than mechanically reproducing the strategies presented as examples, I invite you to try to understand the approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leveraged-bets-on-a-money-market-via-the-market-itself&#34;&gt;Leveraged bets on a money market via the market itself
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every money markets have an associated token, for example the AAVE token for Aave. It is generally used for the governance of the protocol and sometimes also allows to capture part of the value it generates. With this strategy, we will &lt;strong&gt;use a money market to borrow assets that will then be used to gain exposure to the native token of the desired platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimism about the future of a given money market. It&amp;rsquo;s native token in this scenario is expected to appreciate in line with the growth of the market over the medium/long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 - 24 months. ~3 months is a recommended minimum so that gas fees and borrowing costs don&amp;rsquo;t impact the returns of the strategy too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result&lt;/strong&gt;: the acquired token appreciates, which allows to pay back the debt (+ possible interest) at term by reselling part of the initial position. Once the debt is repaid, part of the acquired tokens can be kept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:&lt;/strong&gt; If the token in question can produce a return (e.g. AAVE in the Safety Module), this will allow the debt to be repaid even faster or to accumulate &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; tokens if the scenario of its price appreciation is verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this strategy is quite basic, it is one of my favorites. I recently shared with you on Twitter an example of how to put it into practice, which we will detail here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the concerned protocol is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://liquity.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; and the implementation of the strategy is quite simple, but has two variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;direct-exposure-to-the-native-token&#34;&gt;Direct exposure to the native token
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either by directly exposing yourself to the LQTY token, which is of course more risky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/mm-long-token-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mm-long-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; via one of the frontends, they will serve as collateral for the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow LUSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap LUSD (via ParaSwap for the best rate!) for LQTY, the native token of Liquity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake LQTY, which generates LUSD and some ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually repayment of debt (2) via LUSD yield (4) and resale of some of the LQTY acquired in step 3 after price appreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or more conservatively, with a strategy using Liquity to borrow LUSDs and make them productive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exposure-mainly-in-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Exposure mainly in stablecoins
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/mm-long-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mm-long-token-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; via one of the frontends, they will serve as collateral for the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow LUSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake LUSD via either the Stability Pool (-&amp;gt; LQTY + ETH) or the LUSD pool on Curve Finance (-&amp;gt; Native + LQTY + CRV).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually repayment of debt (2) via yield (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn Finance also offers a LUSD vault that automatically manages the position on Curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investing-time-rather-than-money&#34;&gt;Investing time rather than money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alchemix arrival has opened up new perspectives in terms of strategy. On Alchemix, the debt repays itself over time. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the collateral used (yDAI) is a stablecoin that produces a return (via Yearn)&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus with the current conditions the loan is self-repaying in three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest a simple strategy to take advantage of Alchemix to make a profit. The main drawback is that &lt;strong&gt;only half of the amount of DAI initially placed in Alchemix can be borrowed in AlUSD&lt;/strong&gt; and then invested.
Nevertheless, as this strategy is based on stablecoins, it does not - (⚠ oracles) - involve any price risk and therefore does not require daily monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; DAI that will be locked in for ~3 years. Only half of the deposited amount is mobilizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; ~3 years (depends on DAI return rate on Yearn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result&lt;/strong&gt;: In 3 years, the AlUSD debt is fully repaid and the DAI initially mobilized on Alchemix are free again. It remains to be seen what happened with the investment made with the borrowed AlUSD: it all depends on the choices made, I do not predict the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the borrowed AlUSD to invest in a token that can produce a return. This allows you to make a compound investment or even pay off Alchemix debt faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-alcx-via-alchemix&#34;&gt;Long ALCX via Alchemix
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the concept, I propose another simple strategy which is equivalent to long Alchemix via its token ALCX :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/alchemix-investment-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alchemix-investment-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit DAI as collateral on Alchemix. Alchemix deploys it on Yearn Finance to generate a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow up to 50% of the initial value deposited in AlUSD, a stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest the AlUSD in the desired token. Here for the example it is ALCX the native governance token of Alchemix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stake the acquired token to produce a return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The repayment of the debt in AlUSD contracted on Alchemix is done automatically with time. It is possible to repay in advance thanks to the generated returns (4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-a-hodl-collateral-to-work-over-the-long-term&#34;&gt;Putting a &amp;ldquo;hodl&amp;rdquo; collateral to work over the long term
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to DeFi several years ago with a simple ambition: I wanted to put my Ethers to work. At the time it was not an easy task but nowadays there are many very interesting solutions. I will focus on one of them, Aave, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave has launched &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity mining&lt;/strong&gt; program paid in StkAave&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Aave V2 - Mainnet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave is accessible on the &lt;strong&gt;sidechain Polygon&lt;/strong&gt; where the low fees allow to deploy DeFi strategies efficiently even with small capital. There is also a liquidity mining program there, in MATIC &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this strategy as accessible as possible, we will develop the example on the Polygon sidechain. It is therefore possible to use any of the tokens supported as collateral on the Aave/Polygon market: MATIC, AAVE, wETH, wBTC, USDC, and DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to&#34;&gt;How-to
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy is to &lt;strong&gt;produce returns through the borrowing of stablecoins used to provide liquidity on the Curve exchange service&lt;/strong&gt;. With the liquidity mining program on Aave, every step of the process is potentially lucrative at least in MATIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Having tokens accepted as collateral on Aave, and bring them back to Polygon for example using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the POS bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; Short / medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; Returns in MATIC, stablecoins and ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Facilitator:/&lt;/strong&gt;. Prospective: mining CRV &amp;amp; potential leverage when LP Curve Polygon tokens are accepted as collateral on Aave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;putting-eth-to-work-on-polygon&#34;&gt;Putting ETH to work on Polygon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this strategy, I start with the assumption of generating a return from ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/polygon-aave-curve-eth-farming-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;polygon-aave-curve-eth-farming-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH deposit as collateral on Aave/Polygon (+native +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowing stablecoins (-APR +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit and staking of stablecoins on Curve/Polygon (+natif +MATIC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Curve LP Polygon tokens are being considered for potential addition as collateral in the Aave market. We can also expect potential CRV rewards on Polygon LP positions if the DAO decides to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to implement this strategy by keeping the tokens used as collateral on the L1 Aave in order to benefit from the mining of StkAAVE. It will be necessary to migrate the borrowed stablecoins from the Ethereum network to Polygon using for example &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matic&amp;rsquo;s POS bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protect-yourself-against-the-price-risk-of-the--farming-in-&#34;&gt;Protect yourself against the price risk of the $: farming in €.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, everything is done in dollars. It makes sense, everyone knows, but for a European user it is a significant additional  risk. Indeed, if your ambition is to generate enough to live on with DeFi, then this means your output will eventually be in Euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/eur-usd-1y.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eur-usd-1y&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a European farmer, it may therefore be &lt;strong&gt;interesting to have a DeFi exposure in € to avoid this risk&lt;/strong&gt;. At the moment, there are simply no Euro borrowing options other than &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mimo.capital/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mimo Capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service allows you to borrow PAR from ETH, wBTC or USDC. The MIMO governance token is also distributed to owners of active vaults as well as to liquidity providers on the PAR/ETH and PAR/USDC Balancer pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the protocol is still recent and the PAR token is not yet supported in the ecosystem, as a collateral on Aave or in a Curve pool for example. So the situation is not yet ideal but it has the merit to exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other DeFi-€ solutions are in development. MakerDAO, for example, has mentioned a Euro-DAI, while Jarvis Network is working on a synthetic stablecoin €, the jEUR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-1&#34;&gt;How-to
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To farm natively in Euros, the best option is still what you can do with EURS. Since the launch of the pool on Curve, there are many options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚙ Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; Owning EURS / sEUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📅 Time horizon:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 month - years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 Expected result:&lt;/strong&gt; Growing a capital in Euro-stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🃏 Bonus / Enabler:&lt;/strong&gt; Owning VeCRVs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-recipes/EURS-farming-tokenbrice-en.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;pool Curve&lt;/strong&gt; directly offers an attractive yield in CRV even when it is not boosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To automatically sell the farmed CRVs to compound the return, a vault is ideal. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yearn.finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn&lt;/a&gt; offers a vault on EURS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming is also possible via the EURS vault of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stakedao.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;StakeDAO&lt;/a&gt;, in order to accumulate SDT as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt; also offers a vault that makes up the bulk of the returns while paying in FARM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/sky/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt; are the heart of the DeFi ecosystem. For the final user, these protocols have the same function than a classic bank : borrowing or putting sleepy money at work by lendind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;strong&gt;the analogy stops immediately at this functional comparison&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the underlying logic of money markets has nothing to do with the functioning of a bank. Money markets benefit from all the advantages of DeFi and, in particular, the transparency and accessibility of all operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user borrows on Aave, &lt;strong&gt;the protocol does not need to know his age or identity&lt;/strong&gt;: validate all conditions is enough ! It means that you just have to put enough collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, a user who deposits stablecoins on Aave to generate a return by lending them to others does not trust anyone: he can check at any time which amounts are borrowed by each address to &lt;strong&gt;ensure the solvency of the entire system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem basic to a DeFian, but it is a real paradigm shift. In traditional finance, we have no choice but to trust a third party (auditor, rating agency, etc.) to obtain this kind of information - with the reliability that we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-money-markets&#34;&gt;Discovering money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already talked a lot about money markets on this blog, especially in the article that offers a qualitative methodology to evaluate their risks : &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/money-market-risks.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the one about the different services of abstraction and distribution of the inherent risks in money markets: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, money markets are constantly evolving, both through their updates and through the contribution of third-party services built on top. In addition, new and more challenging money markets are being launched to cover needs that are still unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is precisely our purpose today: &lt;strong&gt;understanding the essential innovations underway in money markets in order to better envision their future development.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than making an exhaustive list, I propose to look at a selection of projects that I think are relevant to understanding the industry evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-built-on-existing-money-markets&#34;&gt;Innovations built on existing money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets may seem really complex at first glance. The curious are most often frightened by the risks of liquidating the collateral when its value is no longer sufficient to secure the borrowed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;easy-loan-positions-management-with-defisaver&#34;&gt;Easy loan positions management with DeFiSaver
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many DeFi users have not yet fully understood the issues at stake here. Many still think that liquidation can be total and sudden. In addition to information and education, tools for managing one&amp;rsquo;s positions help users to feel more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, tools that facilitate and automate the management of borrowing positions on money markets have emerged very quickly, such as DeFi Saver. I already talked about it last year in this article &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/leveraging-ETH.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFiSaver works as a proxy between the user and money markets. It allows new features such as the well-loved &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo;: when the position falls below a user-defined collateralization limit, DeFiSaver automatically rebalances the position with a flash loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In concrete terms, this function sells a part of the user&amp;rsquo;s collateral to pay off some debt and return to a collateralization ratio decided earlier. Such a tool allows the most aggressive or worried borrowers to sleep much more peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reclaiming-liquidation-with-bprotocol&#34;&gt;Reclaiming liquidation with B.Protocol
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although DeFiSaver is very useful, it remains a tool that does not fundamentally change the way the underlying services work. Other projects go further, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bprotocol.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BProtocol&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is very simple: instead of borrowing directly from Maker, the user goes through the BProtocol contract. Funds available to the protocol allows it to &lt;strong&gt;liquidate the user&amp;rsquo;s position (if necessary) before other liquidators do so.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/bprotocolexplainer.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;bprotocol explainer&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is usually a gas war between different liquidators becomes a more predictable operation. It also allows &lt;strong&gt;redistributing part of the liquidation premium to the user himself rather than to the miners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If the value of the collateral is too low compared to the borrowed amount, a liquidation is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually this liquidation is at the expense of another type of user who gets paid (premium liquidation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea, simple at a high level, is nonetheless very reassuring for users while allowing for &amp;ldquo;professionalization&amp;rdquo; of liquidations which become more predictable. There are now about $100M of assets managed by the protocol which already covers Maker and Compound (Aave is coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-of-the-makerdao-model&#34;&gt;Innovations of the MakerDAO model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MakerDAO is probably the best-known money market, but it is also a special one. Indeed, MakerDAO serves a dual function: the service allows borrowing just like Aave or Compound, however &lt;strong&gt;no one lends you anything when you borrow on Maker - borrowers directly mint a currency (DAI) that corresponds to their debt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, while allowing borrowing, MakerDAO also produces a stable asset, the DAI, which is indexed on dollar. Although DAI has its limitations, it is less centralized and requires less trust than stablecoin models like USDC. This is why Maker&amp;rsquo;s model has been taken up many times to serve new purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mimo-capital-down-with-the-dollar-up-with-the-euro&#34;&gt;Mimo Capital: down with the dollar, up with the euro!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the dollar has been the reference fiat currency for DeFi. Almost all stablecoin projects aim to produce an asset that tracks the value of the dollar. In addition, it is also the dollar value of volatile assets that is considered by borrowing systems to determine the collateralization ratio, both on Maker and Compound or Aave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar being the most common and best known fiat currency, it made sense to start with but it is time to go beyond that to meet the needs of all types of users and make DeFi more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what a project like Mimo Capital is looking for, as it proposes &lt;strong&gt;a system similar to MakerDAO but where the Euro is the base currency&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of the dollar. This means that the stablecoin produced by the borrowers - the PAR - follows the Euro, but also that the internal prices of the system are in €, as the value of the collateral used (ETH, wBTC or USDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/mimo-capital-par.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mimo-Capital-PAR&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimo is not coming up in an empty market as Euro stablecoins are beginning to emerge. In addition to Mimo&amp;rsquo;s PAR, there is the EURS stablecoin which follows a centralized model: each EURS in circulation is backed by a Euro fiat owned by the issuer. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;yield opportunities are starting to emerge via Euro exposures&lt;/strong&gt;, for example the sEUR/EURS pool on Curve also accessible via vaults on StakeDAO or Harvest Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of &lt;strong&gt;a protocol like Mimo allows European investors to consider a circuit with the Euro as the reference currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Using their ETH or wBTC as collateral, they can borrow PAR (stablecoin €) and make it productive via, for now, two liquidity pools on Balancer, but eventually, probably more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimo is still a fairly new system with approximately €25 million of collateral deposited as collateral for approximately 12.5 million PARs issued (€). The governance token associated with the service - MIMO - is currently distributed to any active vault holder as well as to liquidity providers on the PAR/ETH and PAR/USDC pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-fiat-currencies-with-reflexer&#34;&gt;Beyond fiat currencies with Reflexer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching from dollar to euro is good, going completely without a fiat currency reference is even better&lt;/strong&gt; This is exactly what Reflexer, another service inspired by the Maker model, offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reference price here. The price of the RAI (borrower-generated asset) is governed directly by the market (average price on the RAI/ETH pair). The system also has its &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; price, the &lt;em&gt;Redemption Price&lt;/em&gt; - the rate used when users directly mint RAI (by depositing ETH as collateral).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/raiprice.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;reflexer RAI price&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various parameters in the Reflexer system adjust to &lt;strong&gt;converge the two prices over time, or at least keep them within a narrow range&lt;/strong&gt;. While this approach is much more difficult for the user to learn, it is completely uncorrelated with the dollar (or any other fiat currency), which is valuable in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand Reflexer, I recommend you to read my previous article on stable assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/pegged-assets.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp;amp; endgame?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-generation-of-money-markets&#34;&gt;New generation of money markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we have considered innovations built on the existing core money markets or directly inspired by their models. There is also a whole new wave of money markets exploring different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore propose to consider two final projects that bring real fundamental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alchemix-productive-assets-as-collateral&#34;&gt;Alchemix: productive assets as collateral?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t start this section with another project than Alchemix! The idea of this project is as simple as powerful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if, instead of taking non-productive collateral, we only took productive collateral &lt;strong&gt;like a stablecoin that produces a return ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our collateral now has a return: what if the return on the collateral &lt;strong&gt;was used to pay off the loan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there you have it: &lt;strong&gt;A loan that pays for itself over time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		alt=&#34;Alchemix overview&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemix launched by accepting yDAI (DAI deposited on Yearn Finance) as collateral. Depositors can borrow up to 50% of the value of their yDAI in AlUSD, another stablecoin dollar. T&lt;strong&gt;heir collateral is not at risk, and the loan pays for itself through the interest generated by the yDAI: it takes about 3 years at the current return rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemix quickly became a very popular service, especially for &lt;strong&gt;proceeding large purchases without spending crypto&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of patience. Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Bob, a DeFi farmer who has worked hard: he now wants to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He wants to raise $50,000 to buy a car. Rather than taking $50,000 directly from his assets, Bob can achieve the same result without spending anything thanks to Alchemix :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob deposits 100,000 DAI on Alchemix, which are then deployed on Yearn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows him to borrow up to 50,000 AlUSD, which he can use to buy his car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob just has to wait while the yDAI returns pay back his loan. In ~3 years, once the debt is paid off, he can get his original 100,000 DAI back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such flow allows to spend immediately without any other cost than the fact of locking about 2 times the amount mobilized within Alchemix.&lt;/strong&gt; The future of programmable money is live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so powerful and innovative that many still find it hard to believe. The feedback from Alchemix users still attracts many skeptics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity-efficiency-at-all-costs&#34;&gt;Liquity: efficiency at all costs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; is another money market that innovates on several levels. The fundamental concept to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;liquidations are automated and therefore much more predictable and quick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; to offer &lt;strong&gt;lower collateralization ratios&lt;/strong&gt; than other systems, or to put it another way: Liquity users can raise more dollars per ETH deposited than on a system like Maker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum loan-to-value ratio (maximum LTV) determines the borrowing power of a collateral. A maximum loan-to-value of 50% means that up to half of the dollar value of the deposited collateral can be borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maker : minimal ratio = 150% ⇒ approximately 66% max LTV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity : Collateralisation minimal ratio = 110% ⇒ approximately 90% max LTV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquity also innovates on the fees side since &lt;strong&gt;the loans are interest free&lt;/strong&gt; unlike other systems. On Maker/ETH for example, the stability fee is 5.5%. If you borrow 10,000 DAI today, you will have to pay back 10,550 DAI in 1 year (if the fees do not change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-innovations/liquity.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Liquity&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is no stability fee on Liquity. Instead, users pay &lt;strong&gt;a one-time, immediate fee when borrowing&lt;/strong&gt;. This fee depends on the &amp;ldquo;base rate&amp;rdquo; which is governed by the protocol directly. It is currently 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Liquity, those who deposit ETH to mint LUSD can then deploy them into the Stability Pool (LUSD) or the LUSD/ETH pair for remuneration in LQTY - the service&amp;rsquo;s native token.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The LQTY can then be staked to &lt;strong&gt;get a share of the LUSD paid to the protocol when a loan is contracted&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the redemption fee (ETH ↔ LUSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity is a so-called &amp;ldquo;governance mimized&amp;rdquo; platform - LQTY is therefore not a governance token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Liquity also innovates in terms of decentralization since &lt;strong&gt;the interface used to access the service is not managed by the team behind the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;. Different frontends operated by third parties are offered while the team focuses on the protocol itself. This ensures that many mirrors exist so that the service is always easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you have found this introduction to the latest innovations in the money markets informative. I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to see the offering growing and becoming denser to cover ever more varied needs. Money markets are essential elements of DeFi, and with the growth of the space, they will become more and more preponderant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me remind you that in addition to functionality, &lt;strong&gt;risk management is the essential element that differentiates each money market&lt;/strong&gt;. Before you start spending large sums of money on them, I invite you to familiarize yourself with the associated risks. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, I wrote what remains to this day &lt;strong&gt;the most exhaustive and comprehensible synthesis to understand the risks incurred in the money markets&lt;/strong&gt;, I invite you to read it:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs): the weight and contribution of ascertainable history </title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/88DeLo.png" alt="Featured image of post Non-fungible tokens (NFTs): the weight and contribution of ascertainable history " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible tokens are attracting a lot of attention lately. On the one hand, the general public is scratching its head about the ever-rising records observed on flagship sales, now covered in the mainstream press&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, artists still not initiated to blockchains realize the potential offered by &lt;strong&gt;disintermediation&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the possibilities offered by &lt;strong&gt;the programmable nature of this new art form&lt;/strong&gt;. In between, a diverse audience ranging from the casual collector to the seasoned speculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: NFTs leave no one indifferent. Indeed, by &lt;strong&gt;combining the logic of provable digital scarcity with art&lt;/strong&gt;, NFTs allow to explore new forms of expression. Moreover, the programmable dimension of NFTs opens the way to a barely begun exploration of new forms of interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to leave theory aside as much as possible and focus on &lt;strong&gt;the practical uses observed with these NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt; We will therefore analyze two fundamental characteristics of NFTs - &lt;strong&gt;their community dimension&lt;/strong&gt; and their &lt;strong&gt;ability to become social markers&lt;/strong&gt;. Once these two dimensions are established, we can consider different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

They are extremely relevant for community-based uses or in video games but &lt;strong&gt;NFTs offer much more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example in DeFi, an inter-asset exchange on Curve involves a &amp;ldquo;receipt&amp;rdquo; NFT and more recently Uniswap is considering NFT tokens to represent liquidity provider positions (and their many parameters) for V3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these different uses of &amp;ldquo;NFT technology&amp;rdquo; are relevant. However, we are going to focus on the artistic and community uses of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-community-dimension-of-nfts&#34;&gt;The community dimension of NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand collectibles and NFTs, I think it is essential to understand their community and social dimension. From a community point of view, the simple possession of an NFT can be enough to show a belonging to a given group, like the CryptoPunks for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that at a primordial level NFTs are a direct response to a very human tendency: &lt;strong&gt;we are all collectors&lt;/strong&gt;, in one way or another. Items usually collected require &lt;strong&gt;trust in the issuer to be certain of rarity&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. Pokemon card). NFTs allow assets with provable numerical rarity, which completely changes the parameters of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henceforth, &lt;strong&gt;each work of art can become famous and its entire history is accessible to all and tamper-proof&lt;/strong&gt;. Where in classical art, only the history of the most famous pieces is told (by secondary sources), with NFTs each piece get the same treatment: its creation as well as each purchase or transfer are recorded on a public blockchain. They can be consulted (and verified) by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-weight-of-ascertainable-history&#34;&gt;The weight of ascertainable history
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story behind a work of art has always been an integral part of it. But with its incorporation directly into the object, without intermediation and therefore without the need to have a third person to tell it, we go to a much more interesting level. My views are still young on the subject, but I am convinced that &lt;strong&gt;with this new tamper-proof interface to access the history of the object, comes a revaluation of it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m testing this hypothesis with a artwork of which I write part of the history, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:111850&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the famous DeLorean 88MPH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. By acquiring a quarter of the circulating total, that is progressively distributed to DeFi France / TokenBrice contributors, I simultaneously articulate these two overarching theses about NFTs: this iconic car becomes both a community tool and a social marker. It shows the belonging to a group, while allowing to prove one&amp;rsquo;s involvement in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too early to draw conclusions from this experiment but nevertheless the first results are encouraging: out of the 22 DeLos, 8 have been distributed. The best buyback offer is currently at 0.15 ETH, which is about 3x the initial purchase price (88 DAI) but none of the 8 people who received this NFT gave in. The Delo is still being traded though: one of them was just sold for 0.5 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For them, some of them at least, this NFT also has &lt;strong&gt;a very personal story&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, it was the first digital object of its kind owned by several of the winners and the context of its acquisition quickly makes it a symbol: it was earned trough their hard work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not give resale instructions for NFT donations. I encourage the winners to keep the NFT if they like it, but &lt;strong&gt;also point out sale opportunities that exist at the time of donation if they wish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nfts-as-a-social-marker--crytopunks-analyses-&#34;&gt;NFTs as a social marker : CrytoPunks analyses !
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the NFTs&amp;rsquo;s social aspect, together with their ability to incorporate and verify their own storyline, another feature emerged : they can be used as a social distinction. Using CryptoPunks to make this point is quite suitable in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/punk-variety-2x.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were among the first NFTs collection projects. The originality lies in their unique charateristics : No two Punks are alike as they have been generated algorithmically with some traits rarer than others. In this way some Punks have become almost legendary as well as their prices !&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time goes by, CryptoPunks have established themselves as the symbol of something way greater than just NFTs. It is now the most traded NFTs collection on the market with a floor price that lies around 17 ETH :&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-recognize-the-scarcity-&#34;&gt;How to recognize the scarcity ?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing and being able to recognize the Punks attributes is a high-valuated skill to be part of the community. There is a total of 10,000 Punks. Indeed, each Punks have their own profile page showing their type (human, Zombie, Ape or Alien) and their different traits, from absolutely none to a maximum of 7 for the most unique of them : only one Punk gathers as much !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that more is best : the demand for Punks without any attribute is really strong due to the very low supply : only 8 in total !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there are only 333 Punks (/10 000) with 1 trait, which also makes them quite rare and wanted. Similarly, Punks with 5 (166 units) or 6 attributes (11 units) are also uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest part of the collection is made up with &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; Punks, with 2 ( 3560 units ), 3 ( 4501 units ) or 4 attributes ( 1420 units ) : these Punks represent almost 95% of the total supply.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punks are now at the center of a whole ecosystem : from technical integrations (with the ERC-721 wrapper for example or into NFTs indexes&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to the artistic field such as the PicassoPunk :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as exhibiting well-chosen modern art in a living room gives a special aura, &lt;strong&gt;displaying your Punk becomes a symbol that goes far beyond the token itself.&lt;/strong&gt; It may now be in good taste to use a Punk from your collection as a profile picture on Twitter. Of course, the more unique and rare it is, the more intrigued the savvy audience will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of CryptoPunks allows us to understand many fundamental things to assimilate the use of NFTs. Nevertheless, the use cases for NFTs are much more diversified. So I suggest you explore a few more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-main-use-cases-of-nfts&#34;&gt;The main use cases of NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;creation-and-sales-services&#34;&gt;Creation and sales services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to acquire your first NFTs is still to buy them. This is &lt;strong&gt;far from being the only method,&lt;/strong&gt; as we will see below, but before that, let&amp;rsquo;s have a quick look at &lt;strong&gt;the main platforms and their modalities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used site is probably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opensea.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;, which allows direct sales or auctions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt; is another easily accessible and potentially more optimized option for creators to emerge. It is sometimes described as &lt;strong&gt;the &amp;ldquo;Etsy&amp;rdquo; of NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services exist, with more curatorial approaches, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://foundation.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;strong&gt;selective about its artists and where each work is a unique copy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each service comes with different modalities and sometimes different NFT types as well: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ERC-721 or 1155 explained here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The rules that govern their auctions and revenue sharing also affect the overall direction of the platform. To start collecting with taste, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know at least what you&amp;rsquo;re buying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nfts--video-games-in-all-forms&#34;&gt;NFTs + Video games, in all forms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious use cases for NFTs is of course video games. Almost everyone understands this immediately once the issue of provable digital scarcity is well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-new-level-of-persistence&#34;&gt;A new level of persistence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without NFT, a player can find himself fighting for days in an online game to get an item&amp;hellip; that is not actualy his. It is sometimes so repetitive that the term &amp;ldquo;farming&amp;rdquo; is also used by players to describe their practice (a slightly different meaning from the DeFians&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;farming&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/nft-usecases/meuporg.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;meuporg&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game services may stop for example (if it is an online game) and often the player cannot exchange his item freely. Incorporating NFTs in video games allows &lt;strong&gt;the existence of a persistence that is not dependent of the game editor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence, as every gamer and every DeFian understands, is in a way the soul of an online game. However, this is only the most fundamental level of the potential contribution of NFTs to video games. They also allow a whole set of additional logic thanks to their &lt;strong&gt;programmable dimension,&lt;/strong&gt; among others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories that are truly co-written by players and can be remembered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items that can exist in multiple games, even potentially with a story that feeds from the different universes where the item is involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Famous players who leave a real mark in the game, far beyond a boss or place named after them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some NFT standards, such as 1155, go further and allow the existence of attributes that evolve on different tokens. They allow to consider a new form of persistence where &lt;strong&gt;the player&amp;rsquo;s actions would potentially translate into concrete actions (on-chain) taken for the organization (the DAO) master of the game(s) involved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-contribution-of-a-marketplace-in-digital-worlds&#34;&gt;The contribution of a marketplace in digital worlds
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proven digital scarcity has been a key issue since the beginning of the first persistent online worlds. All games that have a large audience also have a developed and successful &amp;ldquo;black market&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;each digital world its bazaar paid in real money&lt;/strong&gt;: for example in World of Warcraft, a simple google search allows you to buy gold or various other services to accelerate the progression of your character thanks to a secondary market of service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having an object, potentially created by the game publisher but not dependent on it for its concrete existence, is absolutely new&lt;/strong&gt;. This does not mean, of course, that every object in every game will have a second and third existence, but it is now a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you could deploy your own Charizard - the one that&amp;rsquo;s been sleeping in your GameBoy for over 15 years - in a Pokemon arena in virtual reality. It would become a digital object, represented by an NFT and incorporating all your history with it, making it also, in effect, unique. Each battle or tournament could leave traces on the NFT-object, such as a temporary weakening or learning new abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a primitive vision of the &amp;ldquo;endgame&amp;rdquo; that I foresee, at the crossroads of video games, NFTs and virtual reality. &lt;strong&gt;There is already a concept to describe this new reality that is taking shape : the Metaverse&lt;/strong&gt;. These are persistent virtual worlds composed among others of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;farming-nfts--nft--defi&#34;&gt;Farming NFTs ? NFT + DeFi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If NFTs are coming to games, the reverse is also true: games and NFTs are also coming into DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started very simply, with an approach that every DeFian knows well: &lt;strong&gt;This is the concept of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://dontbuymeme.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Meme&lt;/a&gt;, where the user stakes MEME tokens to obtain points (pineapples) used to obtain the desired NFTs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no other fees than gas costs of the various operations and potentially a minting fee paid in ETH for some coins. Even so, many coins are highly desirable and wanted on the secondary market.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meme is now several months old and has become a service that has managed to surpass its own token. Collaborations with different artists are frequent to propose new collections, but &lt;strong&gt;also directly with projects&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Meme was used to support a game with BadgerDAO. By depositing bBADGER or UNIv2 BADGER/wBTC tokens, users could farm 6 different NFTs related to the project universe. The first player to assemble all 6 different NFTs was able to open a smart contract and receive a nice amount of BADGER tokens as a bonus. &lt;strong&gt;In addition, the possession of these NFTs served as a bonus factor on the distribution (airdrop) of the DIGG token.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://badgerdao.medium.com/badger-x-meme-nft-honeypot-part-ii-diamond-hands-7111d38b5df4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;second part of the Badger NFT game&lt;/a&gt; has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other services use Meme with a similar approach : the YOP platform proposes to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dontbuymeme.com/collections/yop&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;farm &amp;ldquo;tickets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of different rarities. They will potentially allow &lt;strong&gt;access before the general public, once the service is available.&lt;/strong&gt; Here we find the community dimension of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;88MPH is doing something similar &lt;strong&gt;by offering NFTs to the biggest users of its new products a few weeks after their launch&lt;/strong&gt;. Holding such an NFT would also be an excellent criterion to target the most relevant users to test the new versions and participate more actively in the development of the project (purely an illustration on my part, there has been no official announcement in this sense to my knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-infinity-and-beyond-&#34;&gt;To infinity, and beyond !
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article we have mainly developed few analyses that demonstrate possibilities offered by NFTs. Finally, I will give you a brief overview of what&amp;rsquo;s left to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, I had the opportunity to talk with an artist who explores a universe that could be described as &amp;ldquo;role playing with NFTs&amp;rdquo;.  Arke, for example, offers &lt;strong&gt;an innovative collection that is animated with Legends of Cryptonia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside for the usual characters, some have been poisoned, others have specific status and the story of Cryptonia is still being written every day.  The first &amp;ldquo;creature&amp;rdquo; is now available for sale and unlocks access to multiple poisoned characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities offered by NFTs, thanks to their programmable structure, are actually infinite. Before concluding, let&amp;rsquo;s consider few other use cases not yet covered in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are also used as commemorative badges to remember and show presence at a particular event. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.poap.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;POAP project&lt;/a&gt; allows for example to create &amp;ldquo;proofs of attendance&amp;rdquo; for an event with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community membership could also be directly represented by a scalable NFT&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow, among other things, to record the common history by saving each of the on-chain actions of all its members. This use case is obviously unrealistic today with the gas costs of the mainnet, but possible on L2 or sidechain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget also that I have focused this article on the community and artistic uses of NFTs. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention what NFTs can allow in terms of intellectual property or even physical goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, NFTs have the potential to become &lt;strong&gt;a new type of &amp;ldquo;universal dictionary &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt; allowing to represent and define any object but especially family or category of objects &lt;strong&gt;in a reliable and on-chain way&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows the &amp;ldquo;tokenization&amp;rdquo; of what was not tokenizable in the past (non-fungible goods). With tokenization comes a whole set of options - as seasoned DeFians know well and others will soon discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;strong&gt;the use cases of NFTs are still very primitive&lt;/strong&gt;, due to their main limitation: &lt;strong&gt;very expensive gas costs to create, manipulate and interact with&lt;/strong&gt;. I think that the essential dimension of NFTs in the organization of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s digital world will become even more obvious with the democratization of NFTs that the development of various sidechains and Layer 2 will allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;censorship-of-media-associated-with-nfts&#34;&gt;Censorship of media associated with NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I did not address a key point about NFTs: &lt;strong&gt;the persistence of their associated media&lt;/strong&gt;. To be truly persistent and censorship resistant, the NFT must incorporate a direct reference to the associated media file, which is itself hosted using a resilient medium like IPFS. For more details on the issue, I refer you to this clear and detailed discussion on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-nfts&#34;&gt;Discovering NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this introduction and learned something new. NFTs have been a topic of interest for me for a long time that I renewed recently. Besides my research on DeFi, I also intend to share my experience with NFTs on this blog. My last article on the subject was written more than three years ago, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time I took up the pen again!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp; endgame</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/ethereum-stable-assets/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/ethereum-stable-assets/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/money-god-meme.png" alt="Featured image of post Exploring stable assets on Ethereum: approaches &amp; endgame" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to cover an essential topic for Ethereum and other blockchains and often misunderstood: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; assets&lt;/strong&gt;, which track the price of a reference asset. Before looking at the different approaches to producing such an asset, we&amp;rsquo;ll first start with a higher level of analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are such assets needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are they used for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we want to standardize non-native Ethereum assets on this chain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these foundations are established, we will have all the tools to &lt;strong&gt;figure out the different methods and what is at stake&lt;/strong&gt;.. I will conclude with a more detailed analysis of a project that seems to me very relevant and innovative : the RAI of Reflexer Labs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already familiar with the different pegging mechanisms, you can jump &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;#focus-on-reflexers-rai&#34; &gt;directly to the section on Reflexer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-standardization-on-the-ethereums-blockchain&#34;&gt;Assets standardization on the Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of issuance and use of pegged-assets has exploded last year, but before we look at what they are actually used for, let&amp;rsquo;s understand why. The simplest use case is to produce a stable asset, most often indexed to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, &lt;strong&gt;the method used at a high level is tokenization&lt;/strong&gt;: we represent an asset that comes from another chain / world on Ethereum, such as wBTC (corresponding to 1 BTC on the Bitcoin chain) or USDC (corresponding to 1 USD in Circle&amp;rsquo;s bank account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;addresses one of the most common concerns for the general public: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cryptos are volatile assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;the rise of stablecoins has gone hand in hand with the rise of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;, why? According to me, there are many reasons, the main ones being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable assets can be very productive in DeFi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-borrowings-mostly-in-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Why are borrowings mostly in stablecoins?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money markets allow their users to borrow assets using other assets as collateral. The most frequent use case corresponds to the following pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user deposits a volatile asset, such as ETH, wBTC or LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He uses it as collateral to &lt;strong&gt;borrow a stable asset, like USDC or DAI&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so? To put it simply, few people are fond of the risks associated with price changes. &lt;strong&gt;Borrowing an asset, if you then mobilize it, is like shorting it&lt;/strong&gt;. No problem with stablecoins - in theory - but the reality is quite different with a non-stable asset: if the price goes down, good for you: the debt will only be cheaper to repay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other way around, the scenario can be frightening since &lt;strong&gt;you can end up with a debt that increases&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you borrow 1000 UNI when one UNI is worth $20. You sell them for another token, for example stablecoins. So here you are with $20,000 DAI that you mobilize in DeFi for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hold your debt for several months and now you want to pay it off. Except that one UNI is now worth $30 and you no longer have any: you have to buy some back on the markets to pay off the debt and close the position. &lt;strong&gt;The debt is always paid in the borrowed asset&lt;/strong&gt;: you therefore owe 1,000 UNIs at $30 per unit or 30,000 DAI.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality you should pay back slightly more UNI, according to the interest rate and the length of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield-farming-with-stable-assets&#34;&gt;Yield-farming with stable-assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the first point understood, the second one makes perfect sense.: &lt;strong&gt;a lot of people are borrowing stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt;, so that means that on the other side of the market people are lending them out, for attractive interest rates considering the demand. For example, on Aave, one of the main money markets, there has been &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity crunch in stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; almost since the launch of v2. Depositors enjoy an average annualized return of about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is quite similar elsewhere with differences due to the specificities of each money market. Nevertheless, the liquidity crisis on stablecoins goes far beyond Aave: it potentially extends to the whole DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;there is no shortage of opportunities to produce a return with stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about loans here, but it is also possible to bring liquidity to stablecoin pairs and even combine the two approaches to increase returns with a product like Curve:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explosion-of-the-pegged-assets-use-in-2020&#34;&gt;Explosion of the pegged-assets use in 2020
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we have seen a real explosion in the issuance and use of pegged-assets in 2020. On the one hand, more and more projects are being launched to propose &lt;strong&gt;new asset types or new approaches to represent them&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, the scenarios for using these pegged-assets are multiplying thanks to the growth of Curve money markets, vaults like those offered by Yearn or Harvest, and other even more complex DeFi products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name but one, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://alchemix.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alchemix&lt;/a&gt;, a new synthetic asset service that allows &lt;strong&gt;loans secured by your future return&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me explain: with Alchemix, everything starts with a stable asset that produces a return. They chose the yDAI to start with (DAI productive thanks to the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s vault).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user starts by depositing yDAI. He can then &lt;strong&gt;give up his future return&lt;/strong&gt; to borrow up to 50% of the deposited value. His loan is &lt;strong&gt;reimbursed automatically thanks to the interest generated by the yDAI&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, since he has access to 50% of the deposited value immediately (borrowed in alUSD), he can put it to work to increase the return of the entire strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of product allows for an interesting across time arbitrage and leads to an even greater demand for stablecoins: at the launch of Alchemix, deposits in the yDAI vault took off up to the maximum capacity available for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about stablecoins so far, but a similar scenario has played out on other pegged-assets like tokenized BTC on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/stablecoin-growth.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;stablecoin-growth-ethereum-messari&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the impressive growth of DeFi, we can only expect the demand for this type of asset to grow ever faster. So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the different approaches used to produce them to understand their trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-different-methods-to-produce-pegged-assets&#34;&gt;The different methods to produce pegged-assets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the vast majority of this demand for stable assets is being addressed with solutions based on a 1:1 match requiring trust. Thus, it is &lt;strong&gt;mostly USDT ($38.5B issued) and USDC ($9.4B) that are leading the way&lt;/strong&gt;, well ahead of DAI ($2.7B). The same goes for Bitcoin, without going into detail, all the most used solutions require trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegged-assets&amp;quot; are assets that follow the price of another via a mechanism called &amp;ldquo;pegging&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, the &amp;ldquo;peg&amp;rdquo; is the value that the asset must maintain, for example $1 for stablecoins that follow the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing variety of approaches are being explored to produce a pegged-asset with less compromise. They are generally grouped into large families that correspond to the main method used to maintain the peg. However, as these approaches develop, the boundaries between them become blurred as several projects explore &lt;strong&gt;hybrid approaches mixing several elements of each&lt;/strong&gt;. We will start from the simplest to understand and progressively go to the most complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-a-trusted-third-party-11-ratio&#34;&gt;Using a trusted third party (1:1 ratio)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The peg is easily maintained and rather stable. The system is solvent at all times (-&amp;gt; 1 USD in the bank for 1 USDC issued for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The system requires a central trusted intermediary - the issuing organization. This same organization relies on another intermediary, the bank where the USD are deposited. In addition, the presence of a trusted intermediary creates a risk: is it reliable? transparent? The risk goes beyond image, it can also be legal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has already been detailed enough, so I&amp;rsquo;ll move on to the more complex methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins-produced-by-over-collateralization-maker-dai&#34;&gt;Stablecoins produced by over-collateralization: Maker DAI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The system no longer involves a central trusted intermediary (at least initially) &amp;amp; still manages to more or less maintain the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; It will require &lt;strong&gt;always more $ collateral than $ (DAI) produced (over-collateralization)&lt;/strong&gt;. Governance risks. Risks at the liquidation level, carried out by third parties. The system is as trustless as its most used collateral. Maker now accepts censorable collateral (wBTC, USDC, etc.) which reintroduces a trust risk into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before algorithmic stablecoins, MakerDAO is a pioneer when thinking about how to &lt;strong&gt;produce a stable asset with less trust needed in the system than 1:1 approaches&lt;/strong&gt;. Maker is a more complex service because beyond the DAI - the stablecoin issued by the system, it also allows its users to use different assets to borrow (technically mint) DAIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it recreates risks and dangers to maintain the peg of the DAI. Many improvements have been proposed and implemented since the beginning, which allows DAI to be much more stable now than in its early days. Nevertheless, the scaling of DAI has come with additional compromises in terms of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-innovative-approaches&#34;&gt;More innovative approaches
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the approaches are more diversified - I group them into two families: the algorithmic approaches already well studied on my blog and the hybrid approaches. Both are based on an essential concept to understand: the &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; of these systems is a smart contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-smart-contract-as-central-bank&#34;&gt;A smart contract as &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the words &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; because it evokes the essential concept here: the body that issues money and implements the monetary policy of the system is a smart contract. This allows for great transparency and visibility on the actions related to monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the systems presented below, you really need to understand this: &lt;strong&gt;the decisions to create or destroy new stablecoins are &amp;ldquo;taken&amp;rdquo; by a smart contract&lt;/strong&gt; - it alone has this ability to issue (and destroy / burn in some systems) tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say that the smart contract takes &amp;ldquo;decisions&amp;rdquo;, I must explain myself : &lt;strong&gt;to be more precise, one could say that it reacts to the evolution of various measurable parameters&lt;/strong&gt;. The decisions of the smart contract are therefore transparent and predictable. A change in the rules governing it is possible but only via a governance vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often, the main parameter taken into account is simply &lt;strong&gt;the price of the stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, in early algorithmic systems like Basis (BAC is the stablecoin), the rules are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If BAC &amp;gt; $1, then the system issues and distributes new BAC to try to bring the price back towards $1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When BAC &amp;lt; $1 the system destroys BAC to create upward pressure. The destruction is not direct but voluntary: the actors in the system are encouraged to burn their BAC for a coupon (BAB) corresponding to 1 BAC + premium, which they can collect only when BAC has a sustained price above the dollar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more background on this &amp;ldquo;smart contract central bank&amp;rdquo; idea, you can read my first article on algorithmic stablecoins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;L&amp;rsquo;état et le futur des stablecoins algorithmiques&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;algorithmic-approaches&#34;&gt;Algorithmic approaches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; This makes systems without a central trust intermediary possible and thus opens the way to truly trustless pegged-assets. Community governance possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages/Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Sustained peg loss or difficulty maintaining peg. Possible governance attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I analyze the main approaches to produce algorithmic stablecoins in a dedicated article :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;⚖ L&amp;rsquo;histoire de deux modèles de seigneuriage : Basis contre ESD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, projects like ESD, DSD, or Basis Cash were the pioneers of algorithmic stablecoins. However, all of these systems are now in a bit of an abyss: &lt;strong&gt;their stablecoins have been worth well under a dollar for a long time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/bac-90days.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;bac-price-90d&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their users are looking forward to a V2 that will bring stablecoin back to the dollar like the messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hybrid-approaches&#34;&gt;Hybrid approaches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍 Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; The best of both worlds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎 Disadvantages / Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; A new potentially central and  intermediate point of trust appears in the system. You what happened next&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current limitations of first generation algorithmic stablecoins, another approach has successfully emerged: the hybrid approach.  These are intrinsically algorithmic systems that &lt;strong&gt;include nonetheless a reserve in stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. (different from the system) used to maintain the peg: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://samkazemian.medium.com/frax-v2-algorithmic-market-operations-b84521ed7133&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneer in this field is Frax. With Frax, &lt;strong&gt;when FRAX trades above the dollar the system itself sells some to accumulate USDC&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps to bring the price down while building up a reserve of stablecoins not exposed to the system itself. Thus, if FRAX is trading &lt;strong&gt;below the dollar, the system can buy FRAX directly&lt;/strong&gt; on the market (using its stock of USDC) to bring the price back down to $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/frax-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;frax-price-90d&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach has the &lt;strong&gt;merit of efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (FRAX has maintained its peg very well since launch), it reintroduces a trusted intermediary into the mechanism. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not a bank like with Tether, but it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary trust in the system. What happens if the USDC balance of Frax is seized or frozen: could the system survive it? For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, yes it is technically (and legally) possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain very high-level on FRAX and describe the system mostly as it was in the beginning. Many integrations have been implemented or are being considered, such as the ability to mint FRAX directly into the FRAX-Tornado anonymity set (directly into TornadoCash) to offer a potentially more confidential stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-reflexers-rai&#34;&gt;Focus on Reflexer&amp;rsquo;s RAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To finish this article, which I hope will be instructive, I suggest to analyze an innovative system: Reflexer RAI. It is a similar approach to MakerDAO, in the sense that the stable asset is produced by over-collateralization. Nevertheless, it brings many improvements over the Maker model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trustless collateral&lt;/strong&gt;: Until now, RAI only accepts ETH as collateral. This means that 100% of the collaterals in the system are not censurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the dollar&lt;/strong&gt;: the asset produced by the system does not follow the dollar (which is not really stable itself). The price of the RAI is determined by a consensus established by the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Money God&lt;/strong&gt; : just like algorithmic stablecoins, the system reacts to different observed parameters. However, just like MakerDAO, here it is the users themselves who directly hit the RAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt; : the token of the Reflexer system (FLX), which will be distributed to the users, is intended to be used to progressively decentralize the governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t panic if you don&amp;rsquo;t immediately understand why this system is innovative and significant, we will explore each of these points in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;censorship-resistant-collateral&#34;&gt;Censorship-resistant collateral
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initially, MakerDAO only accepted Ether as collateral&lt;/strong&gt;. With the first significant update of the system - the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/White%20Paper%20-The%20Maker%20Protocol_%20MakerDAO%E2%80%99s%20Multi-Collateral%20Dai%20%28MCD%29%20System-FINAL-%20021720.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Multi Collateral DAI&lt;/a&gt; - more tokens became usable as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community was perplexed by this decision, especially because of the choice of accepted tokens. Thus, BAT was one of the first new collateral while LINK, a token with volume and liquidity already far superior to BAT at the time, only arrived much later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this &lt;strong&gt;difficult to understand valuation&lt;/strong&gt;, the crux of the problem is that &lt;strong&gt;many collaterals now accepted are censorable&lt;/strong&gt;: wBTC, RenBTC, USDC, TUSD, etc. This reduces the trustlessness of MakerDAO since at different times up to 50% of all DAIs were minted from censorable collaterals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure is now reduced, but the concern remains. Furthermore, the addition of a special USDC vault was criticized during Black Thursday for helping DAI regain its peg - but it also made MakerDAO even more dependent on such collaterals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Reflexer also fits in as &lt;strong&gt;a reaction to this &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; of MakerDAO&lt;/strong&gt;: for now, only ETH is accepted to open a vault. I will be surprised if the team or the DAO vote to accept censorable collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-the-us-dollar&#34;&gt;Beyond the US Dollar
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Reflexer goes much further than DAI in its quest for stability. Indeed, the dollar itself does not have a stable value, because of the continuous production of new units which leads to inflation: thus $10,000 in 1950 is equivalent in purchasing power to almost $110,000 in 2021 (3.42% inflation per year on average over the period).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An asset that is intended to be stable must therefore go beyond the limitations of the dollar and this is precisely what RAI does&lt;/strong&gt;: it does not follow the price of the dollar. The price of RAI is determined by pure social consensus: the system takes into account the observed price of the ETH/RAI pair (market price) as well as an internal price target (redemption rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often gaps between the two, which creates an incentive to beat the RAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/pegged-assets/reflexer-spread.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;reflexer-spread&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, RAI is obviously not a stablecoin, It is not a pegged-asset either&lt;/strong&gt;. There are not enough words to describe RAI accurately, but let me try. RAI is an abstraction on the ETH which is intended to be more stable than the ETH, while maintaining its trustlessness (with time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-hail-the-money-god&#34;&gt;All Hail the Money God
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Money God&amp;rdquo; is the term used to refer to the set of rules that govern the Reflexer system. The memetic potential is also enormous. To remain quite synthetic, the Money God is lenient towards those who follow a perennial and long-term logic on the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the distribution mechanism of the Reflexer token, FLX, was recently modified to better align incentives (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more info here&lt;/a&gt;). The essence of the change is to better compensate those who perpetuate the system, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit ETH to mint RAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the RAI minted + the equivalent in ETH in the liquidity pool on Uniswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 8, 100% of FLX is being distributed to those who follow this scenario. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/stefanionescu/e66204be990f4bc113a022341cb39186&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The history of FLX retroactive distribution strategies is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-de-governance-plan&#34;&gt;The De-Governance Plan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the important technical innovation on Reflexer, barely explored here, I particularly appreciate &lt;strong&gt;their approach to governance and decentralization of the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, as described by Stefan one of its architects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The principle of “ungovernance” comes from our desire to progressively remove human control from the RAI system, thus making it socially scalable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has established &lt;strong&gt;a plan with concrete and dated goals&lt;/strong&gt; to achieve this end. The first step is to make the system&amp;rsquo;s liquidation and taxation mechanisms &amp;ldquo;governance minimized&amp;rdquo; - only a few parameters will remain changeable via governance (voting of FLX holders) from this point on. The target date is April 17, 2022, a little over a year after the initial launch of RAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each step, the scenario is similar: a critical mechanism of the system is &amp;ldquo;governance-minimized&amp;rdquo; before it is put back under the full control of FLX holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/introducing-flx-20755214a465&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the details of this plan here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following and waiting for Reflexer for over a year, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to finally tell you about it, and please forgive me for the delay: I wanted to put it in context to make sure everyone grasps the innovation brought by this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article &lt;strong&gt;does not constitute investment advice&lt;/strong&gt;. I have no credentials in this area: they do not yet exist for DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am discussing the mechanics of several protocols and what they allow for or envision in the future. Even if I mention tokens, ditto: I discuss their utility or tokenomics but &lt;strong&gt;never their relevance as an investment&lt;/strong&gt;. On this topic, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helps you better understand the rise of pegged-assets on Ethereum - it is essential. It&amp;rsquo;s also critical to understand the different trade-off sets associated with each approach: they are all potentially more or less relevant, depending on your situation and needs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whether you are convinced by Reflexer or not, I strongly encourage you to dig into this system, just as I regularly invite you to explore the workings of Aave, Curve or Unslashed. All four are very relevant and innovative systems: understanding them in depth will allow you to internalize many essential things  to understand decentralized finance in general.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/money-markets-risk/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/risk-tranching/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post Assessing risk in decentralized finance: a handbook for money markets" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money markets are at the heart of DeFi. From a high-level perspective, yes, they simply enable the borrowing and lending of various assets. Yet &lt;strong&gt;those functions are like the two primitive verbs of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; at the base of pretty much all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three major money markets right now in DeFi: Aave, Compound &amp;amp; Cream. Yet all the following services use them, one way or another: Yearn Finance, Curve Finance, Alpha Finance, Harvest Finance, DeFiSaver, Saffron, 88MPH, Idle Finance, etc. To put it simply - &lt;strong&gt;money markets are one of the root-level of DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money markets are amazing - simple yet very intricate. In this article, I try to provide a framework and some clues to assess the risk at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dive more into the service layer currently being built on top of money markets, feel free to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-risk-scoring-is-broken&#34;&gt;I/ Risk Scoring is Broken
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the risk analysis framework, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly discuss the current leading solution used to evaluate risk in DeFi: Consensys CodeFi DeFiScore.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeFiScore is undisputedly compromised since it&amp;rsquo;s still giving DAI a higher rate on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/compound-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/aave/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; even with the oracle failure on the Compound side and the arrival of the Safety Module on Aave&amp;rsquo;s side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consensys CodeFi team was notified a few days ago&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, acknowledged the issue&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but yet &lt;strong&gt;refused any immediate to update the website even with just notice or disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, one of their members proposed a 500 USDC bounty open for anyone willing to update the formula&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It has yet to be claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that quantitative approaches so far have failed. They must achieve both sustainability (if the formula stays consistent it allows historical comparisons) and adaptability (yet the risk parameters are always evolving): it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not delve into the depths of risk scoring, as there is a dedicated article exploring what a decent DeFi-native risk scoring system looks like coming out shortly on this blog (hint: it does not exist yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-appreciating-the-safety-of-a-money-market&#34;&gt;II/ Appreciating the Safety of a Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s painful to hear, but since quantitative analysis is unhelpful, you have to resort to a qualitative approaches for each project. The good news is there aren&amp;rsquo;t many money markets in DeFi worth looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream / Iron Bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these, you have to look at them holistically. I propose an approach that is &lt;strong&gt;purely mine&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;8 different dimensions all critical to the safety of assets&lt;/strong&gt; committed to the money market analyzed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocol access &amp;amp; permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidation mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collateral listing &amp;amp; risk analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanded insurance ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native token risk management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community &amp;amp; Ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we have today is essentially a comprehensive framework you can use to assess the safety of a given money market. Feel free to challenge me on any item. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost no one is qualified to assess risks in DeFi: even &amp;ldquo;institutions&amp;rdquo; doing it like the DeFiscore are way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This content is intended to help you better understand and appreciate the risk &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;by yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the most reliable way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iia-protocol-access--permissions&#34;&gt;II.A/ Protocol Access &amp;amp; Permissions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very base level, you want to know who can update the protocol core parameters (-&amp;gt; the contracts), and the different limits associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, there&amp;rsquo;s usually a &lt;strong&gt;timelock&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that any significant change only applies after a set duration. For the administrative functions of the protocol, you need to make sure that they are &lt;strong&gt;community-owned&lt;/strong&gt;, which usually means &lt;strong&gt;governed by a multisig&lt;/strong&gt; of designed community members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section also includes everything related to &lt;strong&gt;the &amp;ldquo;opsec&amp;rdquo; of the wallets/people&lt;/strong&gt; governing the multisig. &amp;ldquo;Opsec&amp;rdquo; is short for &amp;ldquo;operations security&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s about the safety of everything digital interfaces related to the holders of these keys. Can they be hacked? Impersonated? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a matter is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as we saw recently with the CEO of Nexus Mutual: his laptop was compromised, allowing the hacker to submit a fraudulent transaction on top of a real transaction he signed.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have yet to see significant attacks based on social engineering in DeFi but expect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency on the decisions of the protocol is key too: we address it below in the community &amp;amp; DAO section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on mature money markets like Aave or Compound. Newer projects might be less decentralized, and that can be a good thing - you might want some control and rollback options for a newer project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Chris Blec&lt;/a&gt; is your guy. He&amp;rsquo;s uncompromising on opsec, and produced many helpful contributions on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13S7NRk1girTdQMajnVdU5JRlVO5BG_uJKhTO2Ef10b0/edit?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;summarized overview of the situation for the main DeFi projects here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to wrap this up, here are some good questions to ask to assess the safety of a money market at the protocol &amp;amp; permission level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can update the contracts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they have a credible opsec?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any drain function in the contracts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do the administrative functions do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How decentralized is the process to create a new lending market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iib-oracles&#34;&gt;II.B/ Oracles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the oracles are the source for &amp;ldquo;outside truths&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Blockchains are only aware of themselves&lt;/strong&gt;, so for Ethereum, the price of ETH in dollars (or any other token) is technically an &amp;ldquo;outside truth&amp;rdquo; you need to bring on-chain in a &lt;strong&gt;safe and verifiable manner&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s precisely what oracles do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s essential, as the &lt;strong&gt;perceived price&lt;/strong&gt; delivered by the oracle is the &lt;strong&gt;source of truth for the protocol&amp;rsquo;s liquidation decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. If the oracle says DAI is worth 1.30, then you are liquidated even if your DAI-borrowing position was safe on a $1 DAI and DAI is still actually worth $1 on the markets: the oracle is the source of truth. It happened already with Compound, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a theoretical concern.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news here is that the answer is quite simple: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/chainlink-oracles/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ChainLink&lt;/a&gt; is widely recognized as the most credible decentralized oracle solution, so any money market not using at least partly their price feeds is gambling with its users&amp;rsquo; money, as Compound did with significant lossses. It seems like the situation has not improved - despite the failure Compound still uses the same centralized oracle (Coinbase) and a proposal suggesting a switch to ChainLink was refused. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-oracles&#34;&gt;Assessing oracles
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Significant (most impacting sub-theme to date).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: market-based, potentially whole markets can be drained/affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, on Compound.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can assess the oracles for a money market with the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the source of truth for prices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How reliable is that source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any history of abusive liquidation (stemming from oracle issues)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iic-liquidation-mechanisms&#34;&gt;II.C/ Liquidation Mechanisms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liquidation mechanisms are critical too, but they only happen once a liquidation can be triggered - which depends on the price the oracle returns. So the &lt;strong&gt;liquidation mechanism cannot make up for a faulty oracle&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to first understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, different money markets handle liquidations differently. They have different delays, fees, and restrictions with their liquidations. For instance, the Maker oracle/liquidation (internal system) has a one-hour delay to prevent flash liquidations during unsustained flash crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, liquidation is not sudden neither an all-or-nothing event. There are several buffers to your positions, for instance on Aave, every token has a &lt;strong&gt;maximum loan to value&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;liquidation threshold&lt;/strong&gt;at least slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with USDC as collateral, for instance, there is a 5% spread between the two - the max LTV is 80% (&lt;em&gt;max $8000 worth borrowed from a 10 000 USDC collateral&lt;/em&gt;), while the liquidation threshold is 85% (&lt;em&gt;= liquidation if collateral value &amp;lt; $8500&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-risks/aave-usdc.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Aave USDC collateral parameters&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives borrowers using USDC as collateral another 5% margin so that even if the oracle reports $0.97 no abusive liquidations would occur. The situation is similar in other money markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-liquidation-mechanisms&#34;&gt;Assessing liquidation mechanisms
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly depends on the collateral price action - a flash crash could trigger a chain of liquidations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Significant (the money market can be potentially undercollateralized)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, on Maker where there were issues and delays with liquidations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some questions to ask yourself to assess the liquidation mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When liquidations are triggered; what is the flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any additional delay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the liquidation fees?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another massive subtopic here: the &lt;strong&gt;liquidations do not happen magically&lt;/strong&gt; - they are triggered by other users. So the incentives need to be on point there too so that liquidations do happen when needed and promptly. This topic is even more complex now in an age of high gas costs (liquidation profits vs gas costs of the tx). Skipping it for digestibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iid-collateral-listing--risk-analysis&#34;&gt;II.D/ Collateral Listing &amp;amp; Risk Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that we have a money market getting reliable prices and liquidating when needed, we can start looking at the tokens accepted as collateral and what is the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing a token&amp;rsquo;s health and overall safety is &lt;strong&gt;one of the most complex tasks nowadays in DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; because figuring out the whole ecosystem around a token can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the SNX token, for instance, a major ERC-20 token. It&amp;rsquo;s usable as collateral on Aave, but with quite a low maximum loan to value ratio (to be raised soon?) at 15%. Other ERC-20 tokens like LINK are in the 60-75% range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without diving too much into the details, this has to do with what you can do with each token and &lt;strong&gt;SNX usage as collateral on the Synthetix platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;Aave&amp;rsquo;s risk parameters are conservative enough to essentially &amp;ldquo;front-run&amp;rdquo; Synthetix itself in the chain of liquidations if a black swan event was to happen &lt;/span&gt;on Synthetix. It seems wise: a money market should not want to take higher exposition on a given token than the native platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is the other way around: assess the overall &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; of the latest tokens added as collateral on the platform: are they liquid? Credibly decentralized? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also look at the overall collateral usage for any suspicious mismatch, like on Cream where almost a third of the deposits are FTT tokens (FTX exchange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-risks/cream.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Cream&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-the-collateral-listing-strategy&#34;&gt;Assessing the collateral listing strategy
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Depends on the collateral listing strategy risk appetite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: If a dangerous token is accepted as collateral, the money market can potentially ends-up undercollateralized or even drained. For instance, Cream accepts COVER as collateral. The token suffered three infinite mint attacks already, exposing Cream to further risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❌Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; some tokens got minted to infinity, like COVER&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But they were used as collateral on a money market yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t expand more on this topic since Aave&amp;rsquo;s risk documentation is very well done - check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the risk parameters section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are the collateral listing decisions made?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What risk framework is used for collateral?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the money market adapting to the changing circumstances of the tokens it lists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iie-safety-module&#34;&gt;II.E/ Safety Module
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the risk is known at every level, &lt;strong&gt;insurance is never an option and never supernumerary&lt;/strong&gt;. The first layer of defense is of course the platform-level if there is any compensation module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there is! Aave pioneered the field &amp;amp; even Compound has a reserve now. The second good news is that assessing the usefulness of this module is dead simple: it&amp;rsquo;s a simple ratio between the total $ value of the borrows made on the money market and the total $ that can be mobilized by the safety module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aave has roughly 2B in the Safety Module, of which up to 30% can be seized if needed = 600M. It covers both the V1 &amp;amp; V2 of the protocol. If the 30% on the slashing of the Safety Module is not sufficient, the safety module can mint additional AAVE tokens. Such a scenario is accounted for by neither Compound nor Cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/money-market-risks/aave-safety-module.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Aave&amp;rsquo;s Safety Module&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of insurance, money markets can also have reserves. Compound is the pioneer here, with about $10M in reseve&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Aave also has a reserve system that was recently launched, but I excluded it from the analysis considering the limited balance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking at the available numbers, here are our quick maths:
&lt;code&gt;Safety Ratio = USD value of insurance / Total borrow on the money market&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛡 Aave =  53%&lt;/strong&gt; | $1.765 B (600M can be mobilized) in the Safety Module for $1.1B borrowed accross V1+V2 ($572M V1, $437M V2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🕯 Compound = 0.24%&lt;/strong&gt; | $4.3B borrowed on a $10M safety capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💀 Cream = 0%&lt;/strong&gt; | As far as I know, Cream has no or highly limited (low amounts) native insurance module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ℹ Note: While Compound currently has no safety module, the team/DAO is currently sitting on a large COMP reserve that could be used to that end&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The maths were done on Feb 17 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;evaluating-the-native-insurance-module&#34;&gt;Evaluating the native insurance module
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-null, but not as relevant here. The SM is here to provide compensations in case of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Depositors know they can get slashed if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Aave&amp;rsquo;s pioneering the field. The slashing launched weeks ago. So far no events required Aave to harness the safety module, but it&amp;rsquo;s great to know it&amp;rsquo;s here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how protecting the native safety and insurance modules are, here are some decent questions to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any native insurance module covering the platform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the withdrawal delays &amp;amp; safeguards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the coverage ratio (USD TVL exposed / USD TVL of Safety Module)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iif-expanded-insurance-ecosystem&#34;&gt;II.F/ Expanded Insurance Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the native insurance system of the money market, depositors and borrowers can &lt;strong&gt;cover their positions through a third party insurance service&lt;/strong&gt; like Nexus Mutual or Unslashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;most widely covered risk is the one of a technical failure of smart contracts&lt;/span&gt;. You will find covers for pretty much any widely used contract there is. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;smart contract failures are not the only event that can lead to a loss of funds on a money market&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Robert Leshner the CEO of Compound can factually state the following&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while the protocol recently suffered 90M of abusive liquidations because of faulty oracles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compound has been operating for close to 2 years with ZERO smart contract bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It creates a false sense of security many are falling for, just like the period of operation of the protocol. Notice how I left it out of these 8 criteria? It&amp;rsquo;s because it has close to zero relevance despite services like DeFiScore giving it an absurdly important weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m careful when I talk about &amp;ldquo;90M of abusive liquidations because of faulty oracles&amp;rdquo; but to be explicit - it affected negatively potentially any DAI borrower back then that might have gotten liquidated wrongly - losing a part of their deposit with &lt;strong&gt;no recourse and no compensation&lt;/strong&gt; since Compound operated as intended (smart-contract wise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of risks of smart contract failures, please consider the following list of non-exhaustive other risks that can result in a loss of fund:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure or manipulation of an oracle,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issue with the smart contract of a token used collateral (such as infinite mint),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stablecoin used as collateral or borrowing asset on the market lose its peg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device or wallet of the admin of a not-so-decentralized service is compromised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues or delays with liquidations, meaning the money market can potentially no longer meet its collateralization requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most insurance services are unhelpful with all these risks but for the risks of smart contract failures. The market for other types of risk is barely getting started thanks to Unslashed Finance now providing &lt;strong&gt;coverage for the risk of stablecoins losing their peg&lt;/strong&gt; or custodian risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iig-native-token-risk-management&#34;&gt;II.G/ Native Token Risk Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discussed quite a bit about the various tokens used as collateral, but there is one you need to watch extra carefully: the &lt;strong&gt;native token of the money market&lt;/strong&gt;. So that&amp;rsquo;s the COMP token on Compound, AAVE on Aave, and CREAM on Cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum Loan to Value (max LTV) dictates the borrowing power of collaterals. A 50% max LTV means one can borrow up to half to the dollar value of the collateral deposited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first layer is of course to make sure that there is no fool play: &lt;strong&gt;the money market must be neutral and not favor its own token&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems obvious, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a given. Cream allows an excessive 75% max LTV on CREAM, one of the highest of the whole protocol - as high as some stablecoins. Compound itself gives COMP a permissive 60% max LTV while Aave is more conservative at 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the money market is healthy and the token well designed - people should be bullish on it, meaning some of them use it as collateral to long it - aka depositing AAVE on Aave to long AAVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, despite the permissive LTV, COMP&amp;rsquo;s and CREAM&amp;rsquo;s longs are rarer than AAVE&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-how-a-money-market-manage-its-native-token-risks&#34;&gt;Assessing how a money market manage its native token risks
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s an all or nothing event: the money market can play with fire on its native token for months with no consequences before the situation eventually blow up and the token + the money market crumble together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: The loss can potentially be system-wide (whole money market affected).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❌Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Not yet. But Cream is already way beyond any reasonable max LTV figure on the CREAM token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some considerations worth exploring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the health of the native token of the platform: token contract, liquidity, integrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the native token usage on the protocol &amp;amp; assess the health of its market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership, distribution, and Gini coefficient of the governance token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on the money market themselves. Yet, they are community-driven &amp;amp; governed projects, so their community &amp;amp; integration within the ecosystem are an essential part of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iih-community--ecosystem&#34;&gt;II.H/ Community &amp;amp; Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, communities are essential. It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;nice-to-have&amp;rdquo; to make the protocol more attractive, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;core feature&lt;/strong&gt; and I assess it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On such a topic, again, no metrics will help you just by themselves. The gist is to get a sense of how dynamic the community is. It usually translates into its core components: the DAO, the Discord, and the overall presence in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of a healthy community is &lt;strong&gt;widespread support and usage across the ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;, with many services and products built &amp;ldquo;on top of&amp;rdquo; the protocol examined. Here despite Compound&amp;rsquo;s lead being the first mover, Aave is also now a prime choice for any new protocol building a new financial primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, teams can purposely foster such an environment simply by having members accessible and involved in the space. Besides, Aave has an &lt;strong&gt;ecosystem grants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; initiative helping to fund projects built on top of Aave such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/firp-apwine.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine offering fixed yields&lt;/a&gt;. Other community-related initiatives are a healthy tell, such as hackathons, AMAs, livestreams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again here - make sure to &lt;strong&gt;assess the quality, not the quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to rush out all the initiatives listed above. But doing it right, in a way that makes sense for the community and pushes it forward is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this a case against Compound, but here again, it&amp;rsquo;s so obvious. While Compound community fundings are quite limited the grants program just launched&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, its founder Robert Leshner is an active venture capital investor, with the Robot Ventures funds&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assessing-the-community--dao-of-a-money-market&#34;&gt;Assessing the community &amp;amp; DAO of a money market
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮Likelihood of failure&lt;/strong&gt;: The community is the most important feature of all for the long-term success of the money market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔥Loss of funds risk if failure&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term risk. If a money market loses the community favors, it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be a dramatic event but more of slow and painful threading into irrelevance for the given market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅Already happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, with Compound - they lost their top of mind position and preference for several reasons, such as their lack of support for the ecosystem, the DAI Market Oracle issue &amp;amp; the team reaction to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some questions and clues to help you assess this last yet essential part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the DAO-level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it work to submit a proposal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are they reviewed and improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the delay between the vote and the execution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any proposal that was ignored or not implemented for a long time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core team members:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they legit? Involved in the space? Giving back? Advising?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background-check: any involvement with a scam? What were they doing before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present-check: on top of their involvement with the money market, what are they doing? Any potential conflict of interest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation &amp;amp; support: how hard is it to build on top of this money market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the services built on top of the money market? Are they widely used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they communicating clearly on risk parameters? Do they have non-technical/non-dev risk-focused documentation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-a-note-on-defi-tribalism&#34;&gt;III/ A note on DeFi Tribalism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring such a topic was insanely insightful for me, at so many levels. I remain quite surprised by the tribalism of the space: apart from Aave, gathering the information presented in this article was not a trivial task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the question I asked and the observations I shared, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the target of personal attacks from founders of some of the teams mentioned in this article. Others were quite misleading and selective in their answers. I received no answers from both Cream &amp;amp; Compound official accounts or teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such attitudes gave me even more will to push this article forward. &lt;strong&gt;Beyond the technicalities of each protocol, I think the attitude of the founding team is essential too&lt;/strong&gt;. On this front, there is a protocol that stands an order of magnitude above any other: surprise surprise, it also happens to be the most technically sound, secure, integrated, and exciting, and interesting. 👻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iiia-limitations-of-this-risk-assessment-approach&#34;&gt;III.A/ Limitations of this risk assessment approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I anticipate strong reactions already, so let me add a few more topics not addressed here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we went quite deep, we did not discuss the tokenization process: the process used by the protocol to represent the assets deposited. On this front, &lt;strong&gt;both Compound and Cream are using an archaic approach&lt;/strong&gt; that was topped on all fronts by Aave with the first release of the aTokens in early 2020.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Aave V2 further improved the tokenization process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream by itself is a small market, but &lt;strong&gt;through the Iron Bank other protocols can borrow from Cream&lt;/strong&gt;. Assessing the risk on such a market is even harder - and it was excluded from this analysis. To learn more about the real risk already posed and manifested by such an approach, you can check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.rekt.news/alpha-finance-rekt/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;latest Rekt on Alpha Homora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While MakerDAO provides a service functionally equivalent to lending, the process is significantly different since each borrower is minting DAI. So for the sake of simplicity, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly excluded MakerDAO from this analysis, but for a few meaningful examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no affiliation whatsoever with the Aave, Compound, Cream, or any other money market. However, I do own AAVE tokens (that I purchased myself on the markets) and stake them in the Safety Module. All the content hosted on my blog is made accessible for free - I am the sole editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better grasp of the scope of risks in money markets. I want to stress again that it&amp;rsquo;s non-exhaustive, nor absolute truth but I do firmly believe provides clear and useful contributions to make sure risks in DeFi are broadly understood, better than what currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not agree with this statement, feel free to challenge me. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m eager for facts disproving my observations: it would mean DeFi is safer than I thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the get go, the formula used was abitrary, suffered dozens of obvious flaws and was rigged in favor of Compound through the ridiculous importance given to the time of operations.

&lt;p&gt;The case for aTokens&amp;rsquo; technical superiority could be the topic on an article by itself but here is the gist of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simpler&lt;/strong&gt;: aTokens maintain a 1:1 ratio against the base asset while cTokens have an increasing exchange rate against their base assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier accounting &amp;amp; integrations&lt;/strong&gt;: aTokens 1:1 correspondence makes them much easier to interact with - there is no need to fetch any additional data. With Compound, any service interacting with cTokens needs to fetch the corresponding the cToken/BaseToken exchange rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic and understandable interest&lt;/strong&gt;: both a &amp;amp; c tokens accrue interest dynamically. However, here again, because of aTokens&amp;rsquo; more elegant and straightforward design, the experience is more fluid with aTokens (deposit, reassured by 1:1 correspondence, number go up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More potent integrations&lt;/strong&gt;: aToken allows for novel use cases, especially if you take into account the other features of Aave. For instance, there is a Yearn vault harnessing aLINK to borrow USDC from users&amp;rsquo; deposits to farm with them and settle the income for more aLINK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/firp-apwine/pac-man.png" alt="Featured image of post 🍷 Yields are like fine wines, the secret lies in the brewing process" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields are like fine wines, the secret lies in the brewing process. As DeFi is developing faster than ever, with now more than $ 50 billion of total value locked across all protocols, &lt;strong&gt;the yield offering is diversifying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our topic today strikes at the heart of this trend, with a solution offering a potentially instant payout for deposits on DeFi protocols like Yearn or Aave: APWine. Before we get to this point however, we need to place back some context on money markets and FIRPs in general since they are still novel types of products for most DeFi users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;money-market--pacman&#34;&gt;Money Market = PacMan

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tranching, insurance, and FIRPs are essentially like &lt;strong&gt;abstraction-layers built on top of a money market&lt;/strong&gt; to provide additional features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔪 Tranching&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ better separation of the different type of risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛡 Insurance&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ coverage against technical failures (&amp;amp; more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔮 FIRPs&lt;/strong&gt; ➡ &amp;ldquo;coverage&amp;rdquo; against variations of APY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they are interesting as a features by themselves, what fascinates me is what happens &lt;strong&gt;when/if they are integrated at the base level&lt;/strong&gt;. It would enable other protocols to harness these features. For instance, Harvest could offer a &amp;ldquo;de-risked&amp;rdquo; USDC vault &amp;amp; essentially bringing the whole DeFi to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeFi&amp;rsquo;s different value set is not only a benefit for transparency and audibility: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;also at least &lt;ins&gt;an order of magnitude&lt;/ins&gt; more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; than the dying patchwork of finance it&amp;rsquo;s bound to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-interest-rate-protocols-firps&#34;&gt;Fixed Interest Rate Protocols (FIRPs)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s define what Fixed Interest Rate Protocols are and what are their role within the broader ecosystem of decentralized finance on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With DeFi, the goal for most is &lt;strong&gt;to produce yields from a given asset.&lt;/strong&gt; Usually one of the easiest ways to achieve this will be to lend it for instance, for a return. Doing so means assuming several layers of risk you can insure yourself against (-&amp;gt; Unslashed) or simply avoid taking with tranching (-&amp;gt; Saffron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re super responsible and try to insure &amp;amp; further protect your deposits, you are left with one sizable issue: &lt;strong&gt;the base return produced by the asset is usually volatile&lt;/strong&gt;, making the pricing of the whole package (lended deposit + insurance + tranching) hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;full report here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely where FIRPs get a chance to shine: &lt;strong&gt;since they make the interest predictable, FIRPs help promote a more responsible attitude&lt;/strong&gt; for the whole space - by making it easier to use all the meta-structure now available to protect deposits on money markets or DeFi asset managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article addresses fixed interest rate protocols only. For a broader perspective on risk management for DeFi deposits, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read my introduction piece touching on insurance, tranching and FIRPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In there, we addressed how insurance, tranching, and fixed interest might eventually be integrated natively into money-markets, enabling to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/risk-tranching.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;envision &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; interest bearing stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, this article assume a minimal understanding of the topic. If something is still unclear, please refer to the previous article ☝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apwine-fixed-yield-sauternes-&#34;&gt;APWine: Fixed-yield Sauternes 🍷
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with the hell of an intro and without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into today&amp;rsquo;s matter: &lt;strong&gt;understanding what FIRPs are and what they bring to the table through the lense of APWine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍷 Even better, it&amp;rsquo;s wine-themed and Frenchies are involved - what&amp;rsquo;s not to love already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-difference-between-apwine-and-88mph&#34;&gt;The difference between APWine and 88MPH
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a high-level perspective, both projects could be described as FIRPs, yet they achieve this result through different means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With 88MPH, the yield of your deposits are fixed thanks to a secondary prediction market built for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With APWine, you can lock your assets for a month for instance to instantly earn the yield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to be more explicit, both are not interchangeable nor operating on the same time frame: with 88MPH, the income becomes &lt;strong&gt;predictable but it&amp;rsquo;s still an iterative process&lt;/strong&gt;. With APWine, the income becomes &lt;strong&gt;predictable &amp;amp; instantly delivered&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means different tradeoffs on the risk management side. With 88MPH, the yield is calculated algorithmically - there&amp;rsquo;s always a buyer, which is neat for convenience, but also means the protocol can accrue debt if there is a mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite is true for APWine: since it&amp;rsquo;s market-based, no mismatch can occur (-&amp;gt; no protocol debt), but it means there can be demand/offer issues (such as heavy discount on FYTs).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apwine-instant-payday&#34;&gt;APWine: Instant Payday?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With APWine, the logic is quite straightforward. It all starts by depositing a token earning some yield, such as a stablecoin deposited on Aave or a Yearn vault token onto the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of each period, users receive FYT (Future Yield Tokens) representing their yields for the period. &lt;strong&gt;The FYT are standard ERC-20 tokens&lt;/strong&gt; that will be tradable shortly after launch on APWine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit is locked for the period, however users can withdraw early with a fee, by burning their FYT tokens. The slashing is deactivated for the beta period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the yield is instantly available and usable, APWine should provide ample opportunities for both hedging and arbitraging.&lt;/p&gt;

The beta will start in a couple of weeks with a first period starting on March 1st for 30 days. The APW token and liquidity mining should could shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.medium.com/our-beta-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-3860491a365c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More information on APWine beta &amp;amp; launch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-apwine&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next for APWine?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, I&amp;rsquo;ll be following closely the upcoming launch of the platform next week. Several upcoming releases have already been announced such as the arrival of more services and pools on the platform and the release of the APW token and its associated liquidity mining plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like always though, what gets me really excited is the endgame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-endgame-a-yield-hedging-protocol&#34;&gt;The Endgame: a yield hedging protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we envision the end-game here, first we need to see if the idea works and &lt;strong&gt;if there is a real fit.&lt;/strong&gt; In the APWine case, &lt;strong&gt;success will be measured by looking at the health of the markets for FYT tokens&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect them to settle at parity with expected yields, but if users can really get an &lt;strong&gt;instant payday even with a 20% fee&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving this means having really liquid FYT markets, which is perfectly doable especially if there is a liquidity mining plan in APW token to bootstrap them. Regarding the APW token itself, diving in the FAQ will give you a bit more insight into what the team envisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each future expiration, 10% of the generated yield is shared between all APW token holders (percentage subject to change in the future based on the market demand). The token will also enable them to participate in the governance mechanisms of APWine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/faq&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ApWine FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on top of the usual governance right of the protocol, it seems like there is already a revenue stream considered for the APW token, on top of any potential liquidity mining plan involving an APW-based pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French being the language of DeFi, it was about time we got some fine wine-makers involved in the yield brewing process! If you are interested in the protocol, you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.medium.com/our-beta-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-3860491a365c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read more about the beta here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be following closely as I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0B64swtPI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a chat with Antoine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the persons involved with APWine next week (in French).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/badger-digg/cover.png/" alt="Featured image of post BadgerDAO&#39;s story: an intro through DIGG" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite launching barely a few weeks ago, BadgerDAO quickly grew into a DeFi powerhouse now &lt;strong&gt;hosting &amp;gt; $1.2B of assets farming&lt;/strong&gt;. While I&amp;rsquo;ve quickly touched on Badger in previous articles or shows, I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time for a dedicated piece focusing on DIGG but not forgetting about its context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-intro-to-badger-dao&#34;&gt;A quick intro to Badger DAO
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BadgetDAO is a community-driven project with a clear value proposition: to help &lt;strong&gt;build the infrastructure needed to relay BTC into DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;. This core vision manifests through all their products, all centered around representations of Bitcoin on Ethereum like wBTC or sBTC and the native tokens - BADGER and now DIGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clear-value-proposition-btc-on-ethereum-optimizer&#34;&gt;Clear value proposition: BTC on Ethereum optimizer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first layer of this onion is pretty straightforward: Badger offers a Yearn-like service for BTCs on Ethereum: users can deposit tokens representing a position in a Curve BTC pool to earn BADGER &amp;amp; DIGG on top of the native APY.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also vaults (called &amp;ldquo;setts&amp;rdquo;) available for BADGER and DIGG themselves, as well as their respective LP tokens on both Uniswap and SushiSwap.&lt;/p&gt;

As the vault accrues additional tokens through its harvests, the vault token increasingly represents more and more of the underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value proposition by itself is nothing new and could have been delivered by Yearn directly. What makes Badger special is &lt;strong&gt;how the team approaches building the product and the whole underlying vision behind it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;community-focus&#34;&gt;Community-focus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start, the community has been put at the center with Badger. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly visible simply by looking at the token distributions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;digg-distribution-overview&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the two largest shares of the supply of both tokens were allocated to the liquidity mining program - rewarding active users of the protocol as well as the DAO&amp;rsquo;s treasury tasked with structuring the long-term operations of the protocol and its growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airdrops, along with the vaults created a very attractive loop for the receivers: unlike the UNI airdrop where most people choice was to sell or hold, with BADGER &amp;amp; DIGG, people &lt;strong&gt;optimistic about the protocol from the get-go had the chance to compound their airdrop with the vaults&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial BADGER airdrop recognized key actions tied to Bitcoin on Ethereum, as well as gitcoin donors. The second airdrop (DIGG) rewarded interactions with the Badger ecosystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the momentum created by the launch and initial distribution, the community was able to sustain it thanks to a blossoming spirit of meming: a distribution of NFT was organized on Meme&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, available to the depositors in the bBADGER sett or wBTC/BADGER Uniswap sett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 6 different NFTs were available and the fist one to collect them was able to claim a neat BADGER bounty. Being a holder or farmer of these NFTs was acknowledged in the initial DIGG distribution &amp;amp; their inclusion to Badger as yield multiplier is being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are very bullish on a token price short-term wise, it&amp;rsquo;s usually a bad idea to enter a 50/50 liquidity providing position on it. You&amp;rsquo;ll be much better off simply holding your stack and selling it. If you are worried about this scenario unfolding with Badger or DIGG, you can deposit to the BADGER or DIGG only vaults (no risk of impermanent loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-you-digging-it-yet&#34;&gt;Are you DIGGing it yet?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG is the second major step of Badger&amp;rsquo;s DAO project: a new type of representation of BTC living on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike wBTC or renBTC, DIGG is not backed by a fixed supply of BTCs. Instead, it uses the rebase mechanism initiated by Ampleforth to attempt to eventually deliver an asset keeping track of BTC&amp;rsquo;s price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how DIGG works, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly discuss the pre and post-launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wen-digg&#34;&gt;Wen DIGG?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG&amp;rsquo;s launch was a highly anticipated event. While from the outside it looks like it took longer than what was expected, what happened internally was fascinating: the &lt;strong&gt;initial community gathered around Badger was actively involved in the key decisions surrounding DIGG.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussion within the community, it was decided to go with a relatively low starting supply (4000) allowing for a &lt;strong&gt;stress test from the start of the rebase mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The rebases also started from the very beginning - 24h after the launch of the token.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badger being Badger, the hype machine was of course on point with a &amp;ldquo;Wen DIGG?&amp;rdquo; meme contest to make sure everyone was aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the meat of it: the rebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rebases&#34;&gt;Rebases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIGG is what is called an &amp;ldquo;elastic currency&amp;rdquo;, as initiated by Ampleforth. What it means is that the total supply of DIGG is not set, but fluctuates daily based on the time-weighted average price of DIGG against its peg - BTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more DIGG is &amp;ldquo;off from his peg&amp;rdquo;, meaning its price is superior to the price of BTC, the more the DIGG supply is diluted, with the additional DIGG produced distributed proportionately to all the holders. The mechanism works exactly the same the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with AMPL, with DIGG all holders (liquidity pool tokens included) are impacted by the rebase, be it positive or negative. However with DIGG, just like with the seigniorage tokens, there is a mechanism to abstract it to allow for a better composability within DeFi: that&amp;rsquo;s bDIGG, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss it right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebases happen at a set time, for DIGG it&amp;rsquo;s 3pm EST, that&amp;rsquo;s 9 pm for my dear French readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebase tokens harness mechanisms similar to the ones involved in algorithmic stablecoins / seigniorage tokens, so feel free to read my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous post on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, after the first day, the genesis rebase was positive and triggered a production and redistribution of about 12% of the initial supply. Several positive rebases followed and DIGG is still trading above peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the rebase mechanism is quite straightforward but it might be better aligned with the setts incentives in the future to help DIGG maintain its peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-step-for-the-setts&#34;&gt;Next step for the setts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With DIGG launched, the next big step for Badger as the protocol is to start increasing its capital efficiency: to put it in simple words - to allow its users to borrow from their setts positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it clearer (while extrapolating quite a bit): picture the current Badger, with an additional function allowing you to mint DAI from your setts like you do with your vaults on Maker. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, setts would make for quite desirable collateral, considering they accrue in value against the base asset. So BTC setts for instance could be potentially as safe as their underlying assets, accounting for the additional layers of risks involved by the fact that the underlying asset is a Curve LP token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before we see a native lending market on Badger, I expect to see different &lt;strong&gt;Badger-related tokens and setts accepted as collateral&lt;/strong&gt; on other lending platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this front, I&amp;rsquo;d like to draw your attention to bDIGG in particular. While it represents a position made a 100% of DIGG which rebases, &lt;strong&gt;bDIGG itself does not rebase&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s like a layer of abstraction built on top of DIGG, a rebase-buffer amongst other things. It makes it easier to integrate it into other protocols, and I expect to eventually see a wide range of support for bDIGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-endgame-for-badgerdao--defi-in-general&#34;&gt;The endgame for BadgerDAO &amp;amp; DeFi in general
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endgame for Badger would be like what I described before along with a full ecosystem around the CLAW or whatever his name is.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It would increasingly turn Badger into a more of a Synthetix-like service where holders are given different options of more or less active involvement in the ecosystem, with the appropriate rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As services like Badger integrate money-market components such as borrowing, they &lt;strong&gt;increase the capital efficiency for their users&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to be a representation of BTC producing 20% APY is now the same + you can borrow a share of its value in stablecoin to further increase the yield, if that suits your risk appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic is bigger than Badger, as it&amp;rsquo;s observed elsewhere too, we could call it the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;platformization of Defi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Yearn is implementing a similar approach with the Iron Bank where some services will be able to borrow under-collateralized, generating a capital-efficiency moat for the eligible lucky ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to go back to Badger, moving towards a model like this could mean native &amp;amp; sustained revenue feeds to potentially tie back to Badger. Considering that most of the yields currently come from liquidity mining incentives, that would be quite synergistic to grow out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/dex-value-capture.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;success of the Curve &amp;amp; CRV model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it makes sense to see more and more protocol adopting elements of it: the gist being giving your holders the options to commit their tokens to participate in governance, tap into the platform revenue streams &amp;amp; boost their own returns obtained by the usage of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;rsquo;s precisely what we will do today, tackling the topic mostly by looking at value capture mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMM-based DEXs like Uniswap, Curve or SushiSwap all grew tremendously both in available liquidity and volume this year, and so did the fees they collected. To put it simply: &lt;strong&gt;these DEXs now are the main fee-collectors there are in crypto, right after the Bitcoin and Ethereum network themselves&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite an impressive achievement! So today we&amp;rsquo;ll look at this yummy cake and understand how it&amp;rsquo;s split. What&amp;rsquo;s the different approaches? What is their token used for / how do they establish their incentive model? And then how will the arrival of layer 2 impact all of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rise-of-automated-market-maker-amms&#34;&gt;The rise of Automated Market Maker (AMMs)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the discussions around automated market makers (AMMs) lately, I wanted, as usual, to take a step back and consider the current state of the market, the position of the main players and what&amp;rsquo;s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss AMMs but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the technical details of the bonding curves to others. Instead, we will address the topic from a value capture and tokenomics perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise and development of AMMs fundamentally changed the market&lt;/strong&gt;. Before their dominion, order-book based approaches were still widely used. One of the main merits of AMMs is to change the logic of the service, as it becomes &lt;strong&gt;peer to contract&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need for a matching order on the other side, thanks to the bonding curve, there&amp;rsquo;s always one (within pool liquidity &amp;amp; slippage limits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the key factors that enabled them to grow as they streamlined everything related to token exchanges: from the act of swapping itself, but also liquidity providing and even things like fetching a price for assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have our beautiful DEX-commissions-cake, now let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the main services&amp;rsquo; value capture mechanism to better understand their main differences.&lt;/p&gt;

It might be a good follow-up piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-capture-mechanisms-in-discovery-mode&#34;&gt;Value capture mechanisms in discovery mode
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the different iterations and releases of the main DEXs, their value capture mechanisms evolved. Initially, there was not necessarily a token and a share of the exchange collected fee captured by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uniswap-the-need-for-liquidity&#34;&gt;Uniswap: The need for liquidity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in the first days of the AMM, the main concern was liquidity - still very scarce back then: Uniswap had no token and no need for it to pioneer the AMM-front. The initial and still current fee distribution infrastructure matches this requirement: a &lt;strong&gt;30 bps fee (0.3%) is taken on every trade and distributed to the liquidity providers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a perfect fit to start as you have a liquidity chicken and egg problem to begin with: sufficient liquidity will enable swaps without too much slippage, driving volume (if there&amp;rsquo;s need for the given token/market) and therefore revenues for LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no fee or value capture at the token-level but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;ready to be implemented&lt;/strong&gt; if the DAO was to decide it - the V2 of the protocol shipped last year includes a &lt;code&gt;Protocol fee&lt;/code&gt; feature.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sushiswap-value-capture-to-the-token&#34;&gt;SushiSwap: Value capture to the token
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early days, one of the core changes of SushiSwap was a slight reduction of this fee to 25 bps to &lt;strong&gt;redirect the 5 bps left to SUSHI stakers.&lt;/strong&gt; This enables SUSHI stakers to get a share of the fees collected on all pairs, instead of liquidity-pair based distribution only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the initial distribution phase, there were several adjustments made but the mechanism is roughly the same. Onsen introduced a rotational reward system onboard relevant new pools. More importantly for the tokenomics, ⅔ of the SUSHI rewards earned through liquidity mining are now vested over a 6 months period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/sushi-onsen.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;sushiswap-onsen&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vesting reduces the incentives for &amp;ldquo;mercenary liquidity&amp;rdquo;, especially for liquidity managed by a vault for instance &amp;amp; helps to &lt;strong&gt;make sure that large liquidity providers are also SUSHI holders at all time&lt;/strong&gt; (even up to 6 months after they&amp;rsquo;re done farming), better aligning interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this split, SushiSwap distributes a 0.25% fee for each swap to LP, just like Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s 0.30%. On top of this fee, another 0.05% fee is collected on each swap in form of LP tokens, and settled for SUSHI distributed to the stakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements brought by Sushi are relevant, yet in my eyes the real game-changer is the Curve model, so let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-peek-at-the-endgame-curve-finance--crv&#34;&gt;A peek at the endgame? Curve Finance &amp;amp; CRV
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve&amp;rsquo;s model is slightly more complex than the previous but results in an ever better alignment of incentives between the platform users and the token holders. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of the CRV token, liquidity providers on Curve have been earning CRV tokens on top of their usual commissions (if they stake). And just like SushiSwap, Curve&amp;rsquo;s introduced a form of value capture at the CRV-token level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/curve-pools.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Curve pools&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the model is more intricate so let&amp;rsquo;s discuss each part and see how they interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-tutorial--the-timelock&#34;&gt;1/ Tutorial : The Timelock
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make use of CRV tokens within Curve, the first choice one has to make is the length of its commitment. The base unit is veCRV, a time-weighted locked CRV enabled for governance. To be explicit: &lt;strong&gt;to be eligible for the fees collected and other features discussed below, you need to lock your CRV token for at least 1 year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism is quite straightforward, you can lock for 1 to 4 years. 4 years will give you 1 veCRV per CRV, decreasing linearly to 0.25 veCRV per CRV for a one year period. As said before, veCRV is the base unit of the system - so it will determine how much fees as well as boosting and governance power you have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-level-up-zone--your-share-of-the-fees&#34;&gt;2/ Level-up Zone : Your share of the fees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staking and locking CRV tokens in the DAO is enough to be eligible for a share of the fees collected on Curve, yet it&amp;rsquo;s only the first step of the journey. The commissions are collected frequently and settled for 3pool LP tokens. The mechanism recently kicked off and started distributing rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the effective return fluctuates as it&amp;rsquo;s tied to Curve&amp;rsquo;s exchange volume and the CRV token acquisition price. At the time of writing, it&amp;rsquo;s around &lt;strong&gt;$0.29 yearly for 1 vecRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To describe the next layer of the Curve&amp;rsquo;s onion, I love to use a metaphor inspired from online role-playing games. Indeed, there are three types of realms fitting to describe the next three steps for Curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvE (Player vs Environment)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you face only AI-controlled monsters (mobs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvP (vs Players)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you fight against other players in a set environment (arena/battlefield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RvR (Realm vs Realm)&lt;/strong&gt;: where you fight against other players potentially everywhere (faction-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll use this frame of reference to analyze the next three layers of the Curve&amp;rsquo;s onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-curves-pve---boosting-crv-rewards&#34;&gt;3/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvE - Boosting CRV rewards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to earn CRV on top of their usual commissions. But they can also &lt;strong&gt;use their veCRV tokens to boost&lt;/strong&gt; one or several of their pools, increasing the CRV earned up to 2.5 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, one needs an amount of veCRV proportionate to the $value of the liquidity providing position boosted. The effective cost (in veCRV) to have the maximum boost is not the same for each pool - creating a first layer of incentives/arbitrages games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/dex-value-capture/crv-boost.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Curve CRV boosting&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mechanism enabling a better alignment of incentive: &lt;strong&gt;large and efficient CRV earners are also significant veCRV holders&lt;/strong&gt; (-&amp;gt; locked for 1-4 years) so they have a fair amount of skin in the game. Yet it&amp;rsquo;s just the first &amp;amp; friendliest layer of Curve&amp;rsquo;s meta game. Let&amp;rsquo;s go deeper into the onion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-curves-pvp---the-gauge-weights-game&#34;&gt;4/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvP - The Gauge Weight&amp;rsquo;s Game
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pool-boosting is PvE, the gauge-weights are Curve&amp;rsquo;s PvP arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge-weights are a bit similar to boosting, but &lt;strong&gt;at the platform-level&lt;/strong&gt;. veCRV holders can vote to &lt;strong&gt;decide the share of newly minted CRV allocated to each pool&lt;/strong&gt;. Additional restrictions apply here to prevent the manipulation of the votes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VeCRV needs to be locked with at least 7 days left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gauge weight voting can only be changed by users every 10 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables the incentivization of new pools, theoretically without impulse needed from the Curve team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-curves-rvr---governance--inter-protocol-gov&#34;&gt;5/ Curve&amp;rsquo;s RvR - Governance &amp;amp; inter-protocol gov
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last layer of the onion lies with Curve&amp;rsquo;s governance: veCRV holders can vote on the DAO proposal and with at least 2 500 veCRV, you can submit a proposal to the DAO. So, to recap, once you hold veCRV, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a share of the fees collected by the exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can boost your own CRV streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through gauges, influence future CRV emission on curve pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally with the governance, you have a say in the key parameters of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 1&amp;amp;2 is what is of interest to most-end users, &lt;strong&gt;items 3&amp;amp;4 can be incredibly valuable for other dApps, DeFi projects and protocol politicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the possibilities are virtually endless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance, imagine a project introducing a new stablecoin. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be neat for them to have governance power within Curve to eventually include it in a boosted Curve pool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even deeper into the onion, already &lt;strong&gt;successful DeFi projects with treasury can allocate a part of it to the CRV token to harness the benefits from all 4 items&lt;/strong&gt; - 1&amp;amp;2 to boost their treasury income streams and 3&amp;amp;4 to make their platform or service more attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another layer deeper: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://crv.ape.tax&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s yveCRV vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It offers better returns on CRV than staking yourself (~1.3x), but depositors renounce boosting and voting capacity in favor of Yearn - which can then use this extra boosting/voting capacity to enhance the yield of its vaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final level of depth: imagine a crypto/DeFi PR-like service a couple years from now. I expect them to be able to &lt;strong&gt;supply other projects with proposition power&lt;/strong&gt; on the main DAOs like Curve or Aave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-next-steps-for-curve&#34;&gt;6/ Next Steps for Curve
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have to consider one last dimension on Curve, as it&amp;rsquo;s not just any DEX. Indeed, from the get-go Curve specialized into the &lt;strong&gt;swaps of pegged-assets&lt;/strong&gt; and optimized for it. It started with stablecoins only, but we now also have BTC and ETH representations too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the growing available liquidity, the team is now harnessing DeFi synergies (with Synthetix) to offer swaps between the different pegged assets listed on Curve, such as DAI -&amp;gt; wBTC or USDT -&amp;gt; EURS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides incredible value as it covers markets that are currently not broadly available elsewhere (EURS) and enables a minimization of slippage for large trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay concise, Uniswap and Sushiswap&amp;rsquo;s bonding curves are well suited to &lt;strong&gt;support many small or average swaps, especially on large pools&lt;/strong&gt; with a low slippage. However, they are less optimal for large orders as slippage increases in proportion to the share of liquidity of the pool required by the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; helps you streamline this process &amp;amp; optimize your swap further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-outlook-l2--its-incentives&#34;&gt;Future outlook: L2 &amp;amp; its incentives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this article, let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about the upcoming tectonic shift for the Ethereum space: the increasing availability of layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we saw the value transacted on AMM explode to the detriment of order-book based approaches. They streamlined the whole experience and made tons of sense for layer 1 so we can reasonably expect them to pave the way for L2 decentralized trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loopring is already delivering live in production an AMM on L2:&lt;/strong&gt; a zk-Sync based L2 DEX with various incentives for liquidity providers. Curve has been working with Zk-Sync too, so we can reasonnably expect them to ship a live L2 product this year considering the latest developments with Zk-Sync.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Loopring V2 Stats&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Synthetix recently rolled their Optimism L2 mainnet and the force seems strong around a Uniswap x Optimism rollout. Jokingly the other day I was saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetix Optimism L2 is Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s testnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising to see Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s L2 implementation rolling out within weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, what about tokoenomics x L2? I expect to see &lt;strong&gt;LP incentives too migrating to L2&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s already the case with Loopring. Synthetic too quickstarted its current limited L2 (minting/burning only) with SNX incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services that do not already have a token might have an edge here as they can incentive the L2 directly. On the other hand, the protocols that heavily incentivized their L1 already might lack firepower to match the incentives offered by projects with &amp;ldquo;L2-native&amp;rdquo; tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be fascinating to watch the releases of the different layer 2 and how they impact the protocols usage and tokenomics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-tale-of-two-seigniorage-models-basis-vs-esd/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ⚖ The tale of two seigniorage models: Basis vs ESD" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I shared my first post on algorithmic stablecoins highlighting the key characteristics that made such projects interesting in my eyes. In this piece, we&amp;rsquo;ll go deeper into the topics, with a &lt;strong&gt;comparative analysis of the two main models&lt;/strong&gt;: the Basis model and the ESD model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are successfully used by the projects bearing their names but also a sizable trail of forks, more or less relevant. As the field of algorithmic stablecoin grows, there seems to be a &lt;strong&gt;consensus around these two models, now used as a template&lt;/strong&gt; to quickstart newer projects trying various alterations, such as pegging the system to another currency other than the dollar, like gold or the euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plethora of existing forks enables the latest ones to pick and build upon the existing or pending improvements of the live systems, further leapfrogging the innovation. But before you dive into the arcane of the latest gold elastic token, it&amp;rsquo;s worth making sure you understand the underlying models behind these projects. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-ample-bases-for-elastic-currencies&#34;&gt;1. Ample Bases for Elastic Currencies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, both models are building on the previous Ampleforth model which pioneered &amp;ldquo;elastic currencies&amp;rdquo; that have a supply reacting to the markets&amp;rsquo; conditions. The main issue with Ampleforth is that everyone is exposed to the rebases, hindering the usability of the AMPL as a medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the two new iterations address that with a different take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the seigniorage model, &lt;strong&gt;the rebase mechanism is split into a different token&lt;/strong&gt;, the share - paving the way for a more usable stablecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ESD model, there is still one token only but the DAO and LP lockup achieve a similar result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also introduce the mechanism of bond/coupons to &lt;strong&gt;add a positive incentive when the price is below peg&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to further stabilize the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, after we brush up on the basics, we will compare the Basis model (forked by MithCash, OneCoin, and more) to the ESD model (used in DSD, ZAI, DAIQ, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain the models in-depth but this table recaps the main differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;BASIS MODEL (Seigniorage)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;ESD MODEL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKENS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BAC = stablecoin &lt;br&gt; BAS = a share of the protocol &lt;br&gt;BAB = 1 BAC claim while in expansionary phases&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ESD = stablecoin &lt;br&gt; ESDS = 1 ESD claim while in expansionary phases&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STABLECOIN LIQUIDITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BAC/DAI Uniswap pair: continuous BAS incentives (1y) &lt;br&gt;No lockup&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ESD/USDC ESD incentives if &amp;gt;1 &lt;br&gt;  5 epoch lockup&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;BRING BACK TO PEG&amp;rdquo; (&amp;lt;1) MECHANISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bonds (BAB): BAB = BAC(twap)^2 &lt;br&gt;  No expiration date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coupons (ESDS) Premium-based pricing expire after 90 epochs (30 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN EXPANSION (&amp;gt;1), WHO GETS IT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Boardroom BAS stakers (once treasury has its fill)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dynamic split between LP and DAO depending on the protocol debt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER IMPORTANT MECHANISMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BAS/DAI Uni pair with BAS incentives &lt;br&gt;BAS/DAI &amp;amp; BAC/DAI pools farmable through vaults - Harvest, Pickle, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DAO auto compounds but has a long lockup&lt;br&gt;Lockups -&amp;gt; limited third party integrations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2--gas-efficiency-overview&#34;&gt;2. ⛽ Gas Efficiency Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into the details of each item, here&amp;rsquo;s another key part of the systems to consider if you want to partake in them: how gas efficient are they, for the user?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find here some pointers on the amount of transaction and transaction flows required to partake in different parts of the system we described, helping you assess if it would make sense for you, gas-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;strong&gt;liquidity providing positions are the most transaction-intensive&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in the ESD model where you need to bound and unbound your LP tokens &amp;amp; claim rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-lp---basis-&#34;&gt;2.1. LP - Basis ⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stake LP token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: Claim (stream)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstake LP token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lp---esd-&#34;&gt;2.2. LP - ESD ⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stage -&amp;gt; Bound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward Claim: Unstage-&amp;gt; Stage-&amp;gt; (wait 5 epochs) -&amp;gt; Claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstage -&amp;gt; (wait 5 epochs) -&amp;gt; Unbound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the share/DAO side, &lt;strong&gt;the flow is less transaction-heavy&lt;/strong&gt;, so it&amp;rsquo;s better for smaller holders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;23-basis---boardroom-&#34;&gt;2.3. Basis - Boardroom ⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stake BAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: Claim (after the end of an epoch when BAC&amp;gt;1.05)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstake BAS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: During expansion phases, you can let BAC accumulate in the boardroom and claim several days of reward at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;24-esd---dao-&#34;&gt;2.4. ESD - DAO ⭐⭐⭐⭐
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry: Stage ESD -&amp;gt; Bound ESD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward: no transaction required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit: Unstage ESD -&amp;gt; (wait 15 epochs) -&amp;gt; Unbound ESD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: During expansion phases, the rewards produced by the DAO are automatically compounded (=bounded) without action required from the user-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find the bulk of my analysis in the following table. If you are familiar with both projects, that should be enough, else you can read the explanations for each benefit and downside right after the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👍Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;More liquid stablecoin pair &lt;br&gt;  Fluid share &lt;br&gt;Better coupon system&lt;br&gt;Farmable (3rd party integrations)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;More committed holders &lt;br&gt;Faster cycles: can adjust more dynamically to the markets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👎Downsides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Share has limited utility when BAC&amp;lt;1 &lt;br&gt;  Share price heavily correlated to stablecoin price&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Less accessible system &lt;br&gt;  Riskier coupon system (expiration) &lt;br&gt;  Newly minted ESD batches&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

I’m not qualified to provide any. It’s a mere technical analysis of two seigniorage systems implemented live in production: a farmer’s report 🚜&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we are up to date on each model and their gas efficiency, let&amp;rsquo;s details their benefits and downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31--benefits-of-the-basis-model&#34;&gt;3.1. 👍 Benefits of the Basis model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;311-more-liquid-pools&#34;&gt;3.1.1. More liquid pools
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Basis model, the &lt;strong&gt;BAC/DAI liquidity pool is continuously rewarded with BAS token&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the BAS reward continues even when BAC is in a contraction phase, we&amp;rsquo;re not observing the same compounded reduction of liquidity seen in contraction on the ESD model: when the ESD price is on a downtrend &amp;amp; liquidity providers are pulling out at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/liquidity-esd-bac.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;liquidity-esd-bac-tokenbrice&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that &lt;strong&gt;ESD&amp;rsquo;s liquidity tends to be more spikey&lt;/strong&gt; while BAC&amp;rsquo;s is correlated mostly to BAC price (expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;312-fluid-share&#34;&gt;3.1.2. Fluid share
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share is fluid in the sense that there is currently no commitment required to be eligible for the Boardroom BAC. While this can also make the BAS price harder to stabilize, it makes the expansion-reward component of the system more broadly accessible and less game-able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;313-better-coupons&#34;&gt;3.1.3. Better Coupons
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis Coupons (BAB - Bounds) have no expiration date&lt;/strong&gt;. They can be redeemed for 1 BAC as long as BAC is &amp;gt; 1.05. It makes buying coupons less of a gamble than on ESD where they expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;314-third-party-integradable&#34;&gt;3.1.4. Third Party Integradable
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewards in the Basis model are distributed through &lt;strong&gt;standard staking contract&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling and facilitating the integration by third parties. There are already Harvest &amp;amp; Pickle vaults to streamline the farming of the BAC/DAI, BAS/DAI, MIC/USDT &amp;amp; MIS/USDT pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32--downsides-of-the-basis-model&#34;&gt;3.2. 👎 Downsides of the Basis model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;321-the-share-has-low-utility-when-baclt1&#34;&gt;3.2.1. The share has low utility when BAC&amp;lt;1
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main and by far biggest weakness so far of the current implementation of the Basis model is the &lt;strong&gt;overall weak utility of the share token&lt;/strong&gt;. In expansion phases, its price is usually appreciating because of the newly minted BAC it gives access to. However, there is very little utility for BAS in contraction phases, except for its governance power. In contraction, the only potential earning option is to commit to the BAS/DAI pool for additional BAS, but it&amp;rsquo;s very risky play with a bearing BAS price action (contraction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several projects are already working on solutions to address this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;322-share-price-100-correlated-to-stable-price&#34;&gt;3.2.2. Share price 100% correlated to stable price
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second downside is a direct consequence of the first. Because of the lack of utility of BAS outside of BAC in expansion, &lt;strong&gt;its price is directly correlated to the BAC price&lt;/strong&gt;. Additional utility on BAS could enable both tokens to have more independent cycles, bringing more stability overall to the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33--benefits-of-the-esd-model&#34;&gt;3.3. 👍 Benefits of the ESD model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;331-more-committed-holders&#34;&gt;3.3.1. More committed holders
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ESD model, there is &lt;strong&gt;no access to the newly minted ESD without committing for several epochs&lt;/strong&gt;, at least 5 with the LP. It makes large holders more likely to be actively involved in the minting and stabilizing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;332-adjust-more-dynamically-to-markets-conditions&#34;&gt;3.3.2. Adjust more dynamically to markets&amp;rsquo; conditions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the ESD system operates on a &lt;strong&gt;timeframe three times shorter than Basis&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for more fluid and dynamic adjustments. DSD goes even further with 2 hours epoch (= 12x Basis pace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;34--downsides-of-the-esd-model&#34;&gt;3.4. 👎 Downsides of the ESD model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;341-overall-complexity-of-the-system&#34;&gt;3.4.1. Overall complexity of the system
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the additional lockups, staging, and bounding required to implement the share functionality directly at the stablecoin level, ESD-based systems tend to be more &lt;strong&gt;complex to apprehend&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for newcomers. You can even see it in the memes, where ESD/DSD players love to meme themselves as high-IQ masterminds. The coupon expiration makes the stabilization system extremely unfriendly for newcomers, which is not necessarily a bad thing per se, but see the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;342-weaker-coupon-incentive&#34;&gt;3.4.2. Weaker coupon incentive
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESD coupons have an expiration date, turning the coupon system into a bit of Russian roulette. Because of this design, there are serious risks of losing all the capital committed while burning ESD for coupons, even if the ESD system sustains itself in the long run. Indeed, once ESD is burnt into coupon, the owner has &lt;strong&gt;90 epochs (~30 days) to redeem them before they expire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;343-newly-minted-esd-batches&#34;&gt;3.4.3. Newly minted ESD batches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the emission logic of ESD-based systems, coupled with the lockups period tend to produce &lt;strong&gt;“raindrop epochs”&lt;/strong&gt; where most of the newly minted ESD is unlocked, which can trigger violent price action on the stablecoin price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last expansion phase, the period around epoch 396 was famous and scared because most of the newly minted DSD was made transferrable over a very short window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/dsd-raindrop.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes this is DSD, but similar patterns are observed on ESD. It&amp;rsquo;s due to the DAO lockups and emission schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-the-algostable-toolbox&#34;&gt;4. The Algostable Toolbox
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I let you go, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview of the main tools useful to monitor and manage positions for all four projects. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky! There are some amazing community-build tools made to help you track algorithmic stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🗡 Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/risk-tranching-defi/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/risk-tranching-defi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/risk-tranching/cover.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🗡 Risk? Yes please, but exactly how I like it" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has grown tremendously over the past year, partly thanks to the appearance of more streamlined investment products such as Yearn&amp;rsquo;s or Harvest&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/vaults.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;vaults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to their architecture, they facilitate the mutualization of capital which enables smaller yet profitable investments on money markets and other DeFi services like Curve or SushiSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a necessary and much-welcomed layer, and several improvements are still to be made to streamline things even further and increase gas efficiency. However, I believe the bulk of the innovation this year will come from another front: risk management on the vault-type products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, several definancial primitives have been developed to provide more options to segregate and hedge risks. There are now credible insurance options available for DeFi, as well as a new approach (in DeFi) to better distribute the risk between consenting and informed actors: tranching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll dive right in, but just before that, I think it&amp;rsquo;s apt to examine the terminology too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-lending-protocols-to-money-markets&#34;&gt;From Lending Protocols to Money Markets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been reading me for a while, you might have seen the term &amp;ldquo;lending protocol&amp;rdquo; being used. While it was suited to describe their first purpose, I believe the concept has now outgrown the word, so I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to them as money market from now on. Indeed, &amp;ldquo;lending protocol&amp;rdquo; fails to capture all the subtleties now offered by services like Aave — I&amp;rsquo;m actually a bit late to the party of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the change of nomenclature reflects the different stages of evolution of these money markets. In their first months of existence, there was &lt;strong&gt;a liquidity imperative&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a fight to grow to a sizeable size, big enough to justify interest from other projects to integrate with the money market fuelling a positive growth loop as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen on Aave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2021/risk-tranching/aave-debank.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Aave TVL Growth - Debank&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the critical mass is reached, &lt;strong&gt;the focus can and must evolve&lt;/strong&gt;. To further expand, the money market must extend its range of features - again, like we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Aave do with flashloans and fixed rate loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems clear now that &lt;strong&gt;the second phase of growth of the money markets will be feature-driven&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the base features available on the money market are essential, as these markets are more integrated into other DeFi protocols. The money markets with the most flexibility at the base layer will be able to handle more intricate use cases, such as credit delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, I want to focus this piece on a risk management concept that hasn&amp;rsquo;t found its way to a mainstream money market yet: &lt;strong&gt;tranching&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it can enable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tranching-would-you-like-another-slice-of-risk&#34;&gt;Tranching: would you like another slice of risk?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s start with &lt;strong&gt;the most straightforward &amp;ldquo;risk alteration&amp;rdquo; there is - tranching&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea here is quite straightforward: the different risk layers taken by the depositor of a given money market are tranched - meaning segregated one from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each depositor can choose his preferred exposure. It enables, for instance, a confident degen to &lt;strong&gt;bear all available layers of risk to maximize his APY&lt;/strong&gt; while a more conservative whale could &lt;strong&gt;downsize its risk perimeter&lt;/strong&gt; by exposing oneself to the technical risk only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the core idea, but let&amp;rsquo;s not forget we&amp;rsquo;re talking about decentralized finance here, so &lt;strong&gt;composability is key&lt;/strong&gt;. What makes tranching so exciting is its future as a &lt;strong&gt;financial primitive&lt;/strong&gt; - a building block that other apps and projects can use to deliver new services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll explore more in-depth what tranching as financial primitive entails right after we consider how it currently works in practice, and examine the broader context of risk hedging and APY fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

You can picture these mechanisms enabling diverse types of risk exposure as building blocks making it possible to &lt;strong&gt;build end-user products fitting all ranges of risk appetite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explain why tranching matters more explicitly in the last part of this article where we consider some end-game scenarios for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-tranching-in-practice&#34;&gt;Risk tranching in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole article was actually inspired by a tweet I published where I shared what a tranched aDAI could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, there is mostly one product delivering tranching on mainnet I&amp;rsquo;m looking at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://saffron.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Saffron Finance&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a tranching abstraction layer built on top of the Compound DAI market. The risk segregation is straightforward with two main tranches + one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;AA tranche&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;covered in case of platform failure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;A tranche&lt;/strong&gt;, supplying the cover for the AA tranche (= slashing if a failure occurs) but earns a much &lt;strong&gt;more favorable APY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a third tranche - the &lt;strong&gt;S tranche&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it is simply rebalancing between the two others as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tranching occurs on an epoch-basis, currently set at two weeks. So if you supply the A tranche, for instance, you are bearing the risk of platform failure for the AA tranche for a 2 week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the excitement that followed the launch, Saffron grew to close to $60M assets deposited. Since then, the dust settled around a low bar of roughly $15M of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of every epochs, depositors are not earning rewards anymore until they pull out and deposit in the next epoch tranches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saffron is looking to expand to other money markets, most obviously Aave and expand their token coverage (currently only DAI). Other projects are exploring the idea of tranching, most notably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://barnbridge.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BarnBridge&lt;/a&gt;, but their current achievements are less enticing in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last minute edit: BarnBridge &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CoinbaseCustody/status/1348739247277268997&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BOND token is now listed on Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a more practical understanding of tranching and how it can work, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back to understand what it provides in the broader context of risk management in decentralized finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-broader-context-of-risk-management-in-defi&#34;&gt;Understanding the broader context of risk management in DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on the sole risk related to the definancial product itself: mainly smart contract risks, oracle, and economic attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ve left at least two layers of risk untouched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APY Variation&lt;/strong&gt;: The APY of the service used is usually variable, so there is an additional layer of exposure there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token Price Fluctuation&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, the returns are paid in token different from the ones deposited. If the payout token is not a stablecoin, its price can vary - meaning there is yet an additional layer of exposure to consider here if we want to be exhaustive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, to fully understand the broader context, let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that there are several distinct &amp;ldquo;temporal approaches&amp;rdquo; to risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an approach such as tranching, you can be &lt;strong&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt;, splitting the risk &lt;strong&gt;beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; between participants that understand their exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can also go hand in hand with more &lt;strong&gt;reactive approaches&lt;/strong&gt;, such as insurance - a system providing payout &lt;strong&gt;afterward&lt;/strong&gt; in the event of a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance markets are another fascinating topic by themselves, so we&amp;rsquo;ll stick to this simple mention for now and go back to our yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re talking about insurance, a fascinating project just launched - Unslashed Finance. It&amp;rsquo;s made in France by a builder I admire, so I&amp;rsquo;m a little biased, but feel free &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/unslashed/manifesto-for-a-decentralised-crypto-insurance-unslashed-finance-873078fd0ddd&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to read their manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-take-on-risk-management-for-yields-apy-fixation&#34;&gt;Another take on risk management for yields: APY-fixation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we were saying, the APY of the different yield products available in decentralized finance are constantly fluctuating. It makes for a less predictable income and prevents the entry of investors who are not willing to stomach several layers of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, another layer of meta-financial services is emerging - the base value proposition as an investor is quite simple: they offer a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY on depositors&amp;rsquo; investments&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially another flavor of &amp;ldquo;insurance&amp;rdquo;: you&amp;rsquo;ll get overall a bit of a lower yield, but it&amp;rsquo;s predictable. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to a stable-interest loan on Aave (vs variable rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyer side of such services is super interesting: picture it &lt;strong&gt;like a prediction market, for the yield of a given vault or investment product.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers deposit some assets and place a bet on the expected average yield: the closer their prediction is, the better is the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see the buyer side becoming mainstream anytime soon, but it provides the backbone to yet another useful financial primitive useful to provide services more suited to more risk-averse investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apy-fixation-in-practice&#34;&gt;APY-Fixation in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, there are two projects working on delivering fixed-APY yield on popular decentralized investment products such as the Yearn vaults: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apwine.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;APWine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://88mph.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;88mph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Saffron, 88mph is another abstraction layer built on top of Compound, Aave, and Harvest deposits. It provides a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY for depositors&lt;/strong&gt;, while on the other side of the market buyers of floating-rate bonds are bearing the risk of the fluctuations of the APY of the underlying investment product.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-the-endgame-look-like&#34;&gt;What does the endgame look like?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wrap this up with a little thought experiment. We&amp;rsquo;re now leaving the present and what is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet to extrapolate a bit and consider what tranching &amp;amp; other risk management approaches can enable in DeFi a few months or years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment product built, for instance, on the Aave money market:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a Saffron-like product integrated into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also with an 88mph-like service integrated into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, an insurance such as Unslashed also natively integrated for the DAI peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could envision &lt;strong&gt;the first &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; DeFi investment&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be a wrapped deposit of say DAI on Aave, coming along with tranching to only bear the price risk hedged by a coverage against DAI losing its peg on Unslashed earning a fixed APY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s insane to consider the different steps of the evolution of let&amp;rsquo;s say DAI we witnessed or are about to witness in barely two years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest-bearing&lt;/strong&gt; DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a &lt;strong&gt;fixed APY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a fixed APY &lt;strong&gt;not bearing the technical risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest-bearing DAI with a fixed APY not bearing the technical risks &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;covered against DAI losing its peg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aFIXEDAPYDAI_PEGINSURED: our new monetary overlord? The actual name will be way more catchy, rest assured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to witness &lt;strong&gt;the future of money unfolding methodically before your very eyes as your assets receive software updates&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one cannot wait: I&amp;rsquo;ve been prepping for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Sovereign Individual in the age of technofeudalism</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-sovereign-individual-in-the-age-of-technofeudalism/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/technofeudalism-sovereign-individual/francis-bacon.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Sovereign Individual in the age of technofeudalism" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember when we used to talk of a &amp;ldquo;post-covid world&amp;rdquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s funny to see how the expression quickly stopped being used as people realized the social order of the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; world would be as nonsensical and wasteful as the previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the phrase had the merit to stress the role of the pandemic which brought so much stress on our social structures that it resulted in twenty years of &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; packed into one. I think that today already if we&amp;rsquo;re attentive and careful, we can envision the next steps of our societal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-post-covid-worlds&#34;&gt;The two post-covid worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I for one welcomed the &amp;ldquo;post-Covid&amp;rdquo; world with open arms, as it finally made apparent fundamental shifts that previously were hard to notice. It can be scary and worrisome, but it has one merit: the current situation is exerting &lt;strong&gt;too much pressure on the status quo for it to sustain itself&lt;/strong&gt; — it will eventually normalize one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious end is the extrapolation of the current one: states becoming &lt;strong&gt;increasingly greedy in terms of surveillance and control&lt;/strong&gt;, despite a lack of provable results coming from these strategies. As the situation worsens, they tend to tighten their grip even more to maintain a fleeting appearance of order. The reality is that the facts do not matter anymore — only the perception of them is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis has been documented since the middle of the past century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What&amp;rsquo;s left are citizens who have essentially less liberty than serfs from the Middle Ages, since they are &lt;strong&gt;oppressed by a remote and inaccessible technostructure&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a lord you can visit and plead to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end is the &lt;strong&gt;sovereign individual&lt;/strong&gt;, as described by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg more than twenty years ago.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Such individuals understood the decreasing power and importance of states and developed a form of statelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;treat nation-states like mere service providers&lt;/strong&gt; (health care, education, justice, etc.) and put them in competition with one another. While they are still citizens of one or several countries, they are not tied to them and can move at the moment&amp;rsquo;s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality will allow for a weird but unavoidable cohabitation of the two trends. That&amp;rsquo;s the gist of the thesis I want to explore today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This issue is not political.&lt;/strong&gt; Blue, red, who cares? We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a topic of higher significance than who gets to star the political muppet show of your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nation-states-sliding-into-irrelevance&#34;&gt;Nation-States sliding into irrelevance
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thesis is built upon a previous one: the progressive erosion of power and influence of nation states. It won&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight, it&amp;rsquo;s more of an iterative proccess, just like how our previous power structures fadded into irrelevance, such as the Church: they are still around, but their influence is order of magnitude lower than it used to be a couple of centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several concomitant phenomena are leading nation-states to obsolescence&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First the most obvious: &lt;strong&gt;states are running dry&lt;/strong&gt;! Indeed, the power of states is directly indexed on their wealth. Yet most states are increasingly unable to properly collect the taxes they are due — which are their main source of sustenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States are &lt;strong&gt;unable to have coherent analysis, draw long-term plans, and follow through on them&lt;/strong&gt;, and I think the occurrence of Covid dissipated the few doubts left amongst the skeptics. The reasons here are various including short mandates, our political life turning into a low-tier reality TV, or the place lobbying took.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;States&amp;rsquo; justice is a mockery&lt;/strong&gt;, as some wealthy citizens are outside its reach while those with less status suffer its abuses (police brutality, systemic racism, etc.). Think about whistleblowers if you have any doubt on this: &lt;strong&gt;modern states preserve themselves at the expense of anything else&lt;/strong&gt;, including the life and basic human rights of their citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;no accountability nor check and balances&lt;/strong&gt; for our modern states: the growth loop of the structure is now broken — which is why I am convinced of their upcoming demise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally and most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;states were unable to understand, compute and adapt to the digital reality&lt;/strong&gt; — it requires a form of horizontal thinking that cannot cohabit with their top-down power distribution. We saw the dire consequences of this with the development of the Internet, and we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing it once again with decentralized ledger technologies (~blockchains).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technofeudalism-fills-the-void&#34;&gt;Technofeudalism fills the void
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citizens no longer have root access to the system that rules them&lt;/strong&gt;, their administrative privilege has been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The void left by the states is filled by a more chaotic and insidious structure sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;technofeudalism&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. One of the merits of the states was their relative transparency: you have a government made of public people, supposedly in charge and responsible. The head is identified and (supposedly) held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What grew in its absence is on the other hand a &lt;strong&gt;headless structure&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s made of a myriad of corporations, sometimes promoting shared interests — such as reduced taxation or more lax working laws — but also frequently at odds with one another about specific topics. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a disparate group unable to align on anything but an ever more methodical exploitation of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;our governments got &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo;: they have been captured by private interests.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to lobbying, the citizen&amp;rsquo;s administrative privileges have been removed — they no longer have root access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;will of the people&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;public opinion&amp;rdquo; does not matter anymore as it became &lt;strong&gt;a mere metric to monitor&lt;/strong&gt; with no real weight in the game. It&amp;rsquo;s kept at a certain threshold to preserver the illusion of democracy. Sometimes, the threshold is reached and protests arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s critical is what happens after: when citizens finally dare to ask for anything of significance, in the best cases, they get swamped by conventional thinking or in the worst case face brutal police repression, just like lords would send their footmen to silence a riot without a care about the demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-citizen-and-the-serf&#34;&gt;The citizen and the serf
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find comparisons that can shed light on the status of today&amp;rsquo;s average citizen, one has to go far back in time to the serfs of the Middle Ages. Indeed we find several shared features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute &lt;strong&gt;lack of autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;, as both depend on a third party (state or corporation) for basic sustenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannot determine oneself&lt;/strong&gt;: while it&amp;rsquo;s obvious for serfs, it&amp;rsquo;s as powerful but much more insidious for modern-day citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low to no influence over the power structures&lt;/strong&gt;: a serf can plead to his lord — on the other hand, think about what does a citizen need to do nowadays to simply be heard (and ignored)? The grinding despair of our contemporary world led some of our peers to immolate themselves to shine a light on their cause — think about the level of anguish one must reach to walk this path&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the modern iteration of feudalism has a potent brand new leg that made it possible: the &amp;ldquo;technostructure&amp;rdquo;. Modern-day serfs are living in an increasingly digital world. As soon as they venture into this realm they are in private property — &lt;strong&gt;they renounce ownership over their data and sovereignty over their assets&lt;/strong&gt; (your Facebook pictures do not belong to you). Very few citizens are aware of this, even less are technical-savvy enough to resist it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize my perspective, here are the main fundamental changes that are taking place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The states are less and less meaningful and influential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are increasingly replaced by private entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This replacement actualizes a &lt;strong&gt;de-facto enslavement of the majority of the population&lt;/strong&gt;, unable to self-determine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minority — the sovereign individuals — can extract themselves from the influence of their states, thanks to their wealth, technological savviness or other expertises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-become-more-sovereign&#34;&gt;How to become more sovereign?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to withdraw oneself from the influence of states and private corporations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the real battle is now being waged around the question of who will become sovereign. At the time the book was written, sovereignty was mainly acquired by playing with the world of the past. The situation has changed now: there are now more paths to &amp;ldquo;self-sovereignty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) has completely changed the situation: it is a parallel financial universe built on a radically different set of &lt;strong&gt;pragmatic values&lt;/strong&gt;: transparency, resistance to censorship, composability and open-source. Thus, decentralized finance is in a way &lt;strong&gt;the first &amp;ldquo;digital realm&amp;rdquo; accessible without giving up ownership of its goods or data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the values of our political system are promises that must be actively kept, DeFi&amp;rsquo;s values are applied at the code level: they are &lt;strong&gt;the result of the normal functioning of the system and cannot be violated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi thus allows individuals to possess and exchange goods without the need for an intermediary - it was a form of missing piece to the safeguarding of sovereignty. Thanks to DeFi, everyone can access elite financial services that are more resilient than those of the conventional world, made possible by a mix of private companies and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The state &amp; future of algorithmic stablecoins</title>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-state-future-of-algorithmic-stablecoins/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/algorithmic-stablecoins/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The state &amp; future of algorithmic stablecoins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of December, a new trend has been shaping up in DeFi: algorithmic stablecoins. Several projects launched and saw significant growth, attracting even more interest for this subset of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what they are and what they entail, let&amp;rsquo;s first discuss the addressable markets. Stablecoins on Ethereum are massive: they are around 20B USDT circulating, 3.5B USDC &amp;amp; 1B DAI. As you can see, right now most of the volume is served by stablecoins requiring some forms of trust, such as &lt;strong&gt;USDC or USDT: the emitting company has the power to freeze assets and manipulate balances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maker explored another approach with DAI that has significantly fewer compromises - however, the scalability is lowered. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to consider DAI &amp;ldquo;sufficiently trustless&amp;rdquo; today when the majority of the collaterals used to mint it are not (USDC, wBTC, TUSD, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the recap here would be that so far, there is &lt;strong&gt;an obvious unsatisfied demand&lt;/strong&gt; in stablecoin - the ones that scaled did it with significant compromises, which enabled them to satisfy markets despite being services requiring trust, and more or less worthy of it (especially USDT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this piece today is that after following developments on the stablecoin space for years - it seems like we&amp;rsquo;re reaching an exciting breakthrough with a new generation of stablecoins able to offer &lt;strong&gt;both scalability and credible trustlessness&lt;/strong&gt;. The topic is neither simple nor easily accessible, especially for newcomers. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to walk you through the thought process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-uncompromisingly-trustless-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Why do we need uncompromisingly trustless stablecoins?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what project does what to what end, let&amp;rsquo;s take another step back. We&amp;rsquo;ve established that there is a significant demand for stablecoins, and none of the current leading offers are sufficiently trustless. But what does it mean exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;trustless means that the whole system does not require any central point of trust to operate smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s often mentioned with &amp;ldquo;censorship resistance&amp;rdquo;, a different property that stems from trustlessness. So from a practical perspective, here are some question to help you assess trustlessness: the more permissive the permissions, the less trustless the project tend to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can token balances be seized or frozen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the protocol&amp;rsquo;s code or parameters be updated? In which conditions? By who?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the protocol dependant on 3rd-party services, such as price feed (oracle) that could be manipulated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who/what can print new tokens? Is that user-initiated (someone takes an action) or protocol initiated (a decision the protocol makes based on given parameters)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last question is particularly insightful, as it highlights a core component of algorithmic stablecoins: &lt;strong&gt;their &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; is a smart contract&lt;/strong&gt; — no one controls it, it simply reacts to the system parameters. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive more into this right below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this piece, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the main models available: Ampleforth, Basis Cash, Empty Set Dollar, and Dynamic Set Dollar. I&amp;rsquo;ll not dive into the history of the space and the specificities of each model, feel free to check this article from Deribit Insights if you need more context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stability-elasticity-and-reflexivity-a-deep-dive-into-algorithmic-stablecoins/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Stability, Elasticity, and Reflexivity: A Deep Dive into Algorithmic Stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of diving into each system&amp;rsquo;s details, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw &lt;strong&gt;a sketch showing the core principles this generation of stablecoin is built upon&lt;/strong&gt;, based on the common parameters and design approaches shared in all projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;central-smart-contract&#34;&gt;Central Smart Contract
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first interesting dimension is the &amp;ldquo;central bank&amp;rdquo; of the system - aka who/what can print new tokens and under what conditions? &lt;strong&gt;USDC &amp;amp; USDT pretty much replicate a central bank&lt;/strong&gt; - one entity is in charge of the project and emitting new tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Maker is just a smart contract enabling its users to mint DAI from certain collaterals, the approach is different here. Essentially &lt;strong&gt;Maker/DAI enables you to be your own central bank&lt;/strong&gt;. So the central bank of Maker is a smart contract, but it requires human input to mint DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithmic stablecoins go even further, as &lt;strong&gt;the human input is removed from the minting process.&lt;/strong&gt; In these systems, no one has the capacity to mint tokens - only the smart contract operating it can. It&amp;rsquo;s very elegant and minimal, but it requires a carefully designed set of incentives to make sure the stablecoin will eventually hedge towards its peg. To put it simply, &lt;strong&gt;with algorithmic stablecoins, the central bank is an autonomous smart contract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-army-of-stabilizers&#34;&gt;An Army of Stabilizers
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With algorithmic stablecoins, especially in their early days, peg breaks are frequent. To push the stablecoin back to the peg, the protocols have different kinds of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the stablecoin is worth over $1, &lt;strong&gt;the protocol mints new tokens and distribute them as an incentive&lt;/strong&gt; to users providing liquidity or locking their token, which helps to push the price back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the stablecoin trades below $1, the coupons (or bond) system kicks in: &lt;strong&gt;users can burn their stablecoins for a coupon&lt;/strong&gt; representing it + a premium. However, they will only be able to redeem the coupon once the price is back over the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, at a high level, these mechanisms are simple. They have intricacies that you need to master if you want to partake in the system. &lt;strong&gt;Users understanding them and following them can help the protocol stabilize&lt;/strong&gt;, and if it does they might earn in the process. So these simple rules lead to the emergence of an army of stabilizers, who make use of all the mechanisms to stabilize the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design pushes both game theory and the meme-game to another level:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggressive-expansion-phase&#34;&gt;Aggressive Expansion Phase
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the supply of algorithmic stablecoin is elastic, their mechanism is quickly battle-tested. Indeed, at launch, the circulating supply of the stablecoin is usually low and the attractive incentives create a lot of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;strong&gt;Basis Cash launched with 50 000 BAC tokens&lt;/strong&gt; distributed to the first stakers. Roughly a month after, there are now &lt;strong&gt;40M BAC circulating&lt;/strong&gt;: they were produced because BAC has been trading &amp;gt;$1 most days since the launch. So far, there was no phase where BAC&amp;rsquo;s TWAP &amp;lt; $1, so the Basis&amp;rsquo; coupon system (BAB) has not been tested yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Basis Cash has 24h epoch. ESD is 8h and DSD is 2h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, ESD and DSD already saw several cycles of expansion and contraction each, with the protocol operating as intended:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harnessing-defi-composability&#34;&gt;Harnessing DeFi composability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key principle of algorithmic stablecoins is composability. We often think of it as &amp;ldquo;how can I plug my finished product/service into others?&amp;rdquo;. These projects go much further, as &lt;strong&gt;they use other protocols like Uniswap as a central part of their system.&lt;/strong&gt; Basis, ESD and DSD all have three main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An internal locking/staking mechanism for expansion phases (DAO or Boardroom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A burn&amp;amp;redeem mechanism for contraction phases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Uniswap pair (/USDC or /DAI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their very structure demonstrates an understanding of DeFi and its composability. By placing the Uniswap-pair(s) at the core of the protocol, it helps on so many levels - since &lt;strong&gt;Uniswap is staple DeFi users are familiar with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap is the main pool, the liquidity on other DEXes is increasingly looked at. With the launch of Omakase, Sushi added two new incentivized algorithmic stablecoin pools: ESD/ETH &amp;amp; DSD/USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composability is key for algorithmic stablecoins and several projects are already taking steps to get more integrated within the ecosystem. Within the next few months, we should see the next steps of this with the arrival of some algorithmic stablecoin as collateral on lending platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oracle-minimalism&#34;&gt;Oracle Minimalism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle are used as a base parameter in the algorithmic stablecoin system:: they are the &lt;strong&gt;source of truth for the price of the stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. Making sure the oracle is resilient and cannot be gamed is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, the previous generation of projects, especially Maker, tended to overengineer things. In the early days, Maker&amp;rsquo;s input parameter was almost the pure &amp;amp; raw price of ETH. However, to make the system less prone to &amp;ldquo;flash liquidations&amp;rdquo;, Maker built their own oracle, and use several delays and averages with the liquidation price to &lt;strong&gt;add some inertia to their system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before our algorithmic stablecoins tend to be minimalist and harness the composability of DeFi. &lt;strong&gt;With their Uniswap pairs, they already have a decent price feed with significant liquidity, making it hard to manipulate&lt;/strong&gt;. So the Uniswap price is used as the based, but generally computed as a TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) to avoid price manipulations right before rebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being minimalist, the systems are efficient and elegant: as these stablecoins projects grow, so should their liquidity on Uniswap, making the oracle more resilient and the price harder to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one am excited as to where this subset of the space is heading. Whether you intend to partake or not in the bootstrapping phase of such stablecoins, I think it&amp;rsquo;s highly valuable to document yourself on them as they are a good tell of the main trends of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-algorithmic-stablecoin-toolbox&#34;&gt;🧰 Algorithmic Stablecoin Toolbox
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we part way, allow me to share some useful tools to track the evolution of these stablecoins. First, each project has its own tracker providing the main metrics for the current epoch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve felt legitimate to write this piece because I&amp;rsquo;ve been following closely Basis Cash, Empty Set Dollar, and Dynamic Set Dollar closely, as well as Basis Dollar &amp;amp; Share less attentively. Frax is another hybrid project that is worth looking at - I did not discus it as I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar enough with it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yearn Finance&#39;s Merger Spree</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/yearn-finances-merger-spree/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/yearn-finances-merger-spree/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-merger/y-among-us.gif" alt="Featured image of post Yearn Finance&#39;s Merger Spree" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn Finance has been making headlines lately with the announcement of &lt;strong&gt;several acquisitions&lt;/strong&gt; like Pickle Finance or SushiSwap. The Yearn team has joined its development forces with five other DeFi projects already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grasp what&amp;rsquo;s happening, we&amp;rsquo;ll look back at the main events since September and how each of the different sub-projects is now working to achieve a shared goal. While Yearn is still relatively new, there are already many chapters to its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to better understand the latest events - the merger spree, let&amp;rsquo;s first quickly consider the three phases of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s development and how they led to today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beginnings of Yearn with the fair launch of the YFI token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How YFI&amp;rsquo;s launch became a template with the waifus (forks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of the Yearn Ecosystem: Yearn beyond the vaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yearns-backstory-launch-waifus--the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Backstory: Launch, waifus &amp;amp; the ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last June, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s token launch was a unique moment, initiating what is now called a &amp;ldquo;fair launch&amp;rdquo;. Essentially, the &lt;strong&gt;YFI token was distributed over a week to users&lt;/strong&gt; depositing to several pools related to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s products. Feel free to check &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my first story on Yearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to learn more about this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It translated into a growing awareness for the project, a rapid price appreciation of the token, and attracted involved DeFi users to contribute to Yearn through the DAO&amp;rsquo;s discussions. The launch was so successful that it actually became a template replicated more or less successfully by many other projects: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-waifus.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s waifus (forks)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Yearn was focusing on its own products, the main ones being the vaults enabling streamlined implementations of farming strategies. The vaults too grew beyond Yearn to become a product offered by many DeFi services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction was not exactly clear back then. Indeed, there were many products being worked on, such as yBorrow, ySwap, yinsure, or the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decrypt.co/43292/eminence-finance-exploit-leads-to-degen-soul-searching&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Eminence exploit&lt;/a&gt;. However, the core product, the vaults saw little improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last few months, the vision for Yearn&amp;rsquo;s development evolved. Instead of an inward-facing plan focused on the ecosystem, the Yearn team started to look outward. At the same moment, Yearn&amp;rsquo;s DAO was structuring its processes and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-54-formalize-operations-funding/7956&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;formalized operations fundings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to the current merger phase - joining development efforts with other DeFi projects on relevant areas of expertise. Token-wise, nothing is changed, each project keeps its own token and sovereignty over it. So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yearns-mergers&#34;&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s Mergers
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the context set, let&amp;rsquo;s now look at the different projects joining forces with Yearn and how they contribute to add value to the offering. We&amp;rsquo;ll consider them as they happened, in their chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some of these mergers are still pending a token holder vote to be validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A NFT was made to immortalize this moment of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s history: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:90731:0xac6d5c44c7a089101c53735211b12f5f722c7688&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yAmong us, by Cryptouf - available on Rarible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pickle-finance-1124&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance (11/24)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: PICKLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Streamlined investment products (vaults)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;symbiotic relationship&amp;rdquo; with Pickle Finance was the first to be introduced on November 24. The idea is to merge the efforts of the two projects currently offering similar products. Pickle will now deliver an &lt;strong&gt;incentive mechanism on top of the Yearn vaults&lt;/strong&gt; through gauges, similar to Curve&amp;rsquo;s current model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By joining forces, it creates additional options for Yearn vaults depositors while securing the assets deposited in the Pickle jars, one of which was subject to a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cointelegraph.com/news/pickle-in-a-pickle-as-attacker-swipes-20-million-in-evil-jar-exploit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;$20 million exploit &lt;/a&gt;shortly before the merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cream-finance-1126&#34;&gt;Cream Finance (11/26)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: CREAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Money Market - Lending &amp;amp; Borrowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger with Cream is even more exciting as it would expand the range of strategies Yearn vaults could use. Cream is a lending platform, a fork of Compound with several changes including the collateral accepted. yUSD (Yearn yCRV vault share) has been supported as collateral for a few months already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two teams teaming up mean a more systematic approach, eventually &lt;strong&gt;paving the way for leveraged vaults&lt;/strong&gt;: the vault token share being used as collateral on Cream to borrow more stablecoin and increase exposure. Cream would eventually become the lending arm of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More info in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cover-protocol-1128&#34;&gt;Cover Protocol (11/28)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: COVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Peer to peer coverage market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn has been trying to provide coverage and insurance for its products, with projects like yInsure. So working with another project on this front is highly synergistic, since it could enable &lt;strong&gt;coverage for Yearn vaults&lt;/strong&gt; while allowing the team to focus on its core offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cover-merger-651142828c45&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the announcement here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;akropolis-1130&#34;&gt;Akropolis (11/30)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: AKRO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Streamlined investment products (vaults)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t expand too much into this one, as it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Pickle. Akropolis was providing services similar to the vaults, so &lt;strong&gt;joining forces allow increasing TVL&lt;/strong&gt; by creating another frontend for Yearn/Pickle while beefing up the security of Akropolis, as it too suffered &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://news.bitcoin.com/hackers-drain-2-million-in-dai-from-defi-protocol-akropolis/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an exploit for $2M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sushiswap-1201&#34;&gt;SushiSwap (12/01)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Token&lt;/em&gt;: SUSHI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt;: Decentralized Exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sushi is now &lt;strong&gt;the second DEX by volume&lt;/strong&gt; with roughly half ($889M) of the total value locked of Uniswap. To attract liquidity to the platform, Sushi distributes its token to the providers of liquidity on certain key pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could allow Yearn to &lt;strong&gt;incentivize liquidity providing for critical pairs of the Yearn ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;, such as a CRV &amp;lt;&amp;gt; yyveCRV to drive deposit into this vault which can provide additional returns for other Yearn deposits on Curve. The team joins efforts so that Sushi/0xMaki can lead the AMM efforts amongst the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-for-yearn&#34;&gt;What does it mean for Yearn?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this merger spree is a &lt;strong&gt;massive increase in Yearn&amp;rsquo;s firepower&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;strong&gt;form of recentering&lt;/strong&gt;: some key parts of the ecosystem are delegated, such as the AMM (swaps) to Sushiswap&amp;rsquo;s team, or the lending markets to Cream. It should enable the team to move faster on its core products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now so many mergers announced that CoinGecko created a category to track them: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=yearn-yfi-partnerships-mergers&amp;amp;view=market&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🦎YFI Partnerships &amp;amp; Mergers Coins by Market Capitalization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, composability is key and Yearn is yet another demonstration of what it can achieve. Indeed, there is one last dimension to stress with these mergers: liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these 5 acquisitions, Yearn will roughly triple its total value of assets locked across its ecosystem. Along with the synergies, it could help Yearn develop a moat that will be hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeFi is a toolbox reaching beyond finance</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/defi-is-a-toolbox-reaching-beyond-finance/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/defi-is-a-toolbox-reaching-beyond-finance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post DeFi is a toolbox reaching beyond finance" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance is ready to grow beyond its sandbox: with a dense network of financial primitives, it&amp;rsquo;s now easier than ever to harness DeFi for other ends, such as to replace a predatory relic of our past like the lottery, still insanely popular and detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this story, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take a step back and adopt a macro perspective on Ethereum. So far, my interest mostly revolved around decentralized finance, as it drove the innovation over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I believe we&amp;rsquo;re reaching the next step of the growth of the incredible human coordination experiment that is the Ethereum network: the lego blocks provided by DeFi are now mature enough to be harnessed for other ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we&amp;rsquo;re now seeing how these &lt;strong&gt;streamlined value capture and exchange devices&lt;/strong&gt; can be harnessed to facilitate the creation of engaged communities or sustain the commons. So this time, instead of what or how, let&amp;rsquo;s ask why? After a quick reminder on the key benefits delivered by DeFi legos, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a few projects harnessing them to flip the table in their respective domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defis-legos-the-core-building-blocks&#34;&gt;DeFi&amp;rsquo;s Legos: The core building blocks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myriad of decentralized financial services available on Ethereum demonstrated the benefits of what I like to call &amp;ldquo;pragmatic values&amp;rdquo;: transparency, accessibility, accountability, and interoperability. Why pragmatic? Because withholding them is not a matter of goodwill of the system&amp;rsquo;s participants, they are &lt;strong&gt;enforced by default and continuously as long as the network is operating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask your bank how your money is invested, you get an answer you can trust or not. Verifying it involves inquiries from your end. On the other hand, you don&amp;rsquo;t ask Yearn where your money is: you see what it&amp;rsquo;s doing at all times, and this information is reliable and unfalsifiable. It&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental change in the relationship - the user of a DeFi service is not a mere &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute to unpack these core pragmatic values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: By default, transactions on the Ethereum network are public. For DeFi, this translates into very concrete benefits - for instance, volumes &lt;strong&gt;observed (on the chain)&lt;/strong&gt; on decentralized exchanges tend to be much more realistic than volumes &lt;strong&gt;reported&lt;/strong&gt; by centralized exchanges (tracked in their internal database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: To use a DeFi service, such as an exchange or an asset management system, all you need is an Ethereum wallet and a device with an internet connection. On unstoppable services like the DEX Uniswap, there is no way to blacklist an address from using it. This has obvious benefits for populations usually discriminated against by financial services operators, such as gamblers, sex workers, or foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability:&lt;/strong&gt; DeFi services are like lego blocks, they are open source so that they can be improved and built on top of. It enables rapid innovations as new projects can quickly deliver value by assembling several existing services in new ways. Everyone can check their code and easily contribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalism&lt;/strong&gt;: Ethereum is a network designed for resiliency and it comes with interesting consequences. With a highly redundant infrastructure where bandwidth and storage capacity are limited, successful projects tend to be those able to reduce or avoid unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeFi ecosystem delivered a range of services thanks to which anyone can buy, sell, secure, exchange tokens in a decentralized fashion. They also &lt;strong&gt;normalized behaviors that were uncommon before&lt;/strong&gt;, such as staking tokens, borrowing, using leverage, minting synthetic assets, and many other options made possible once assets are tokenized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I was saying in the introduction, so far these new legos have been used mostly in a reflexive manner. Now, they are increasingly used to deliver innovative services offering even more possibilities. It&amp;rsquo;s essential as each new DeFi layer enables many more use cases outside of finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixing-a-detrimental-societal-institution-using-defis-legos&#34;&gt;Fixing a detrimental societal institution using DeFi&amp;rsquo;s legos
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious and trickle down from here: fixing the lottery. As you probably already know, lotteries are poverty traps sometimes described as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/state-lotteries-are-an-exploitative-tax-on-the-poor/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an exploitative tax on the poor&lt;/a&gt;. Their public is predominantly poor, and overall the lottery is not helping with their budget. Even with a lucky outcome, other issues arise sometimes leading right back to the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with the lottery has many roots, including the fact that they are usually owned or operated by national governments. The good news is that DeFi can deliver the core element of the lottery - the prize - in a much more sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to deliver a jackpot, you need some form of prize. Current lottery models pool together contributions from everyone to return it to one player, minus the cost of the operations and a fee: money is &amp;ldquo;burned&amp;rdquo; within the base loop because of the infrastructure required to run the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi can do much better on both fronts. First, for the prize: instead of a net-loss system, PoolTogether provides a &lt;strong&gt;no-loss lottery&lt;/strong&gt; to its players. The gist is simple: they are not buying a ticket but instead depositing stablecoins into a pool. Assets from all players are used to produce a return using the decentralized lending markets. The &lt;strong&gt;winner earns the interest generated by the whole capital over the period, and everyone gets back their initial investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also comes with many improvements over legacy lotteries infrastructure: using Ethereum tokens to represent lottery tickets comes with additional benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; - drawing the winner and paying the prize is much faster, public, and verifiable by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traceability&lt;/strong&gt; - every operation is public and auditable, making it easier to prevent frauds and abuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt; - all you need is a wallet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lottery example is essential to better understand &amp;ldquo;DeFi+&amp;rdquo; use cases. DeFi by itself is amazing. But &lt;strong&gt;using DeFi to replace predatory societal infrastructure? Sounds like even closer to its reason to be!&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ll explore this theme further by looking at the funding of public goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enabling-sustainable-commons-gitcoin&#34;&gt;Enabling sustainable commons: Gitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decentralized DeFi projects, the community is key as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;we’ve seen with Yearn Finance&lt;/a&gt;. On top of their role of driving the project development and growth, communities also frequently deliver key resources, such as dashboards, calculators &amp;amp; diverse tools to facilitate the tracking and management of positions, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zerion.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zerion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the macro level, the main tools used to track the overall growth of the industry also stem from the community, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defillama.com/home&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFillama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarming.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YieldFarmingInfo&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarmingtools.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YieldFarmingTools&lt;/a&gt;. The development of such services is usually fueled thanks to community donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the discovery and funding of such projects, there is a platform harnessing the possibilities offered by Ethereum to improve public good funding: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://gitcoin.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. Gitcoin streamlines the creation of “Grants” to collect donations for given projects and communities. It makes the most of Ethereum core attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/gitcoin-grants.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Gitcoin-grants-round7&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All donations are public and transparent&lt;/strong&gt;, making it easy to measure and track contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects can be funded with common Ethereum-based tokens, usually stablecoins such as DAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the community is the main driver of contributions, Gitcoin uses a system called quadratic funding to balance contributions. Each round, &lt;strong&gt;it matches contributors&amp;rsquo; donations&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to an additional budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The budget is provided by donors from the ecosystem. While it used to be mostly large Ethereum-based companies, a new type of sponsor is emerging: treasury funds of DeFi projects. Indeed, some key DeFi players like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-direct-of-rewards-towards-ethereum-public-goods-funding/3699/22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn Finance voted to allocate a portion (1%)&lt;/a&gt; of their protocol income to fund Gitcoin grants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still room for improvement - and Gitcoin keeps getting better with every new matching round - it’s already a critical part of the infrastructure used to fund the commons on Ethereum. It really streamlines the process of collecting donations for community-driven projects. We use it for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR newsletter&lt;/a&gt; along with other sources, and it’s part of what is enabling us to deliver a high-quality yet free newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Gitcoin grants round just started. You can give to support your favorite projects with an additional matching until December 17. Allow me to suggest a selection of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/collections?featured=true&amp;amp;collection_id=24&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;people documenting DeFi in non-English languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - just like I try to do with French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to support French DeFi particularly, feel free to check the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr-the-daily-gwei-fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR &amp;amp; DailyGweiFR grants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a pair of newsletter offering two different takes to learn about DeFi, in French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-ethereum-help-art-markets-be-more-transparent-and-fair&#34;&gt;Can Ethereum help art markets be more transparent and fair?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another subset of the Ethereum ecosystem has been delivering incredible value for community building lately: non-fungible tokens (NFT). While the term is a mouthful, the base idea is actually quite simple: NFTs deliver another level of digital scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find a detailed explainer on NFT two years ago, still relevant and accessible for newcomers: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/nft.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with DeFi, NFTs are now enabling new forms of community interactions and fundings. Using &lt;strong&gt;self-serve platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, artists and communities can autonomously create and sell NFTs with services streamlining the process like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://rarible.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their programmable nature, NFTs enable &lt;strong&gt;new re-distribution models&lt;/strong&gt; such as a contribution on secondary market purchases. Finally, since they live on the Ethereum blockchain, NFTs also provide a transparent history of ownership and previous prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again, thanks to Jon (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/otherbright&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;@OtherBright&lt;/a&gt;), BanklessFR has been exploring this new frontier too. Thanks to a collaboration with the artist Arke, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:43413:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;we’ve released a NFT&lt;/a&gt; tied to the newsletter&amp;rsquo;s content. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked Jon to share some pointers on the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://banklessfr.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedailygweifr.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Daily Gwei FR&lt;/a&gt; we are trying different experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;BanklessFR-NFT&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Arke56374430&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Arke&lt;/a&gt;, we started with the sale of a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:43413:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BanklessFR NFT&lt;/a&gt;, representing the newsletter BanklessFR. This collectible card, available in 40 copies, was successfully sold at 0.15 ETH each. We shared the profits with the artist. We included an article that can be unlocked at the time of purchase, 24 hours ahead of readers who do not have the card. This distribution model is clearly innovative, but in my opinion requires to be developed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:64356:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;second sale&lt;/a&gt;, different from the first, still for BanklessFR, illustrated an article, and offered 10 copies of the card, at 0.3 ETH per unit. It also contained an article that could be unlocked 24 hours in advance. The latter worked much less, certainly because of a relatively high price, despite a rarity 4 times greater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-beyond-finance/the-daily-gwei-fr.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;TheDailyGwei-FR-NFT&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:81692:0x83ac01254b0b8e9745492c5e73f5f32a05570a76?tab=overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;last sale&lt;/a&gt; concerns the launch of The Daily Gwei FR. We published 50 copies of a card representing the newsletter. We haven&amp;rsquo;t sold one yet, 0.05 ETH per card, 50 cards available. We will modify this sale to continue the experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have other ideas in mind, here the experiments are relatively simple, but much more complex systems should be implemented. I think we should insist on funding from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/1274/banklessfr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;gitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://clr.fund/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;clr.fund&lt;/a&gt;, before accelerating on the NFTs side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these services provide innovative tools to build and grow communities. Thanks to the disintermediation, NFTs put artists back at the center of the stage. We&amp;rsquo;re seeing more and more instances of collaboration between an artist and a community, like we did for BanklessFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;re entering an age of renewed excitement, especially for people outside the space, make sure to direct newcomers to reliable resources: how about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/-guide-1-starting-with-bankless&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bankless&amp;rsquo;s getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-markets-blackhole&#34;&gt;The markets blackhole
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, the trajectory of the last couple of years of development makes even more sense. The financial functions were the necessary first steps, as they now operate as primitive enabling more intricate interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their very base, &lt;strong&gt;markets simply are distribution/allocation mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. So far, in the world of old finance, we&amp;rsquo;ve let technocrats design them, to the benefits of the most connected and rich participants. With DeFi, we&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with our own ways of creating markets. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen migrations of billions over a few days to chase a given incentive such as Uniswap UNI mining or the one-week YFI mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly put, our finance is already strongly superior to any meatspace counterpart. We can create immense and healthy markets in days. Have derivatives and other options for the next one. Leverage soon after. &amp;amp; all/most of this delivered in an unstoppable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a trader, this might sound like tooling overkill. It&amp;rsquo;s really not. Picture finance like a base layer underlying all the others. Whatever your goal is, your system will probably have to manage some finite resources, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our markets - our base layers - are more efficient than any other so we can reasonably expect a compounding impact of this increased efficiency as we move down the stack. Simply put, finance is the first battlefield we&amp;rsquo;ve won: the decentralized approach succeeded and delivered a superior infrastructure without equivalent. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the next!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/next-steps/df1.png" alt="Featured image of post One step closer towards working for and answering to the Ethereum &amp; DeFi community" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I move on with the next chapter of my involvement in the DeFi space, I wanted to take the time to write a rare personal statement to share my story and what&amp;rsquo;s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovering-the-ether&#34;&gt;Discovering the Ether
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 36 months ago, I finally read the Ethereum whitepaper after hovering around the crypto space for a while and was instantly hooked. Back then, my concerns were far remote from decentralized finance: I saw in Ethereum the first credible solution to coordinate a scale aka the first sword finally able to slay the beast Moloch&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still working in a non-crypto related tech startup back then but quickly I found myself spending 6 to 10 hours a day reading on the space, meeting and chatting with many people that shared my interest. Shortly after, I started contributing to various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in July 2018, &lt;strong&gt;I realized it was time to grab the bull by the horns and break my way into the space&lt;/strong&gt; - I was not going to work for yet another tech startup. I started what I wished could be a collaborative media back then: EcoCrypto. It was a bit of the precursor to this blog, and you can &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/tags/ecocrypto/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;find the articles re-published here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ecocrypto-the-precursor&#34;&gt;EcoCrypto: The Precursor?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach on EcoCrypto was quite particular: every article was reviewed by people completely outside the space, such as my parents. They were rewritten until the result was self-sufficient and understandable. After that, I also translated them into French. This writing process was intense and time consuming. Back then, naively, I thought that trying to go above and beyond in terms of research and quality would be enough to attract the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the moderate audience, EcoCrypto taught me a lot about the space. To beef up and learn at an accelerated pace, I&amp;rsquo;ve also spent a few months writing &amp;ldquo;content bounty&amp;rdquo; and secured my first batch of ICO-shitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-pro&#34;&gt;Going Pro
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling more confident about my understanding of the space and my capabilities to handle marketing-related tasks for a crypto project, I started applying to selected companies, and went through the interview processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exchanged with a few prominent actors of the space, but I was &lt;strong&gt;quickly turned off by their internal culture &amp;amp; inertia&lt;/strong&gt;: all my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in startups so I&amp;rsquo;ve got little patience for corporate-induced BS. Around the same time, I found Monolith (TokenCard back then) and started discussing with the team about the community manager role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was excited by the product and its ambitions, especially its user-focused aspect. Until then, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with products quite remote from everyday people. On the other hand with Monolith &lt;strong&gt;I could see a long-term vision where even my parents were using the product I was contributing to&lt;/strong&gt; (and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1290979491561472000&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;it happened&lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my slim professional experience in the crypto space (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly commonplace in 2018), Monolith took a bet on me and I started in April 2018 as Community Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communities--brands&#34;&gt;Communities &amp;raquo; Brands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much in that role! What I loved the most about it is that I was a frontliner always in contact with exciting people. Back then, there was no covid either so I also had the chance to actually meet these people, in Paris, in London, and even attend the DevCon V in Osaka!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s silly, but Osaka blew my mind. Before it, I felt the energy and ambition of the space. Going there, I &lt;strong&gt;saw&lt;/strong&gt; it personally, and it was something else. It bolstered my confidence in the impact Ethereum could have on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also around this time that I&amp;rsquo;ve met &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mounibec&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mounir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/arthurmicoulet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, and together we created &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/learndefi/_index.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi France&lt;/a&gt;: the attendance at our first event blew our mind, with 90 people in the room for an event organised in a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s precisely then that I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck by a critical thought I needed months to digest, it goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent my whole professional life building artificial communities to support the growth of brands. How about I finally use this hard-earned expertise for a better end? How about we drop the brand &amp;amp; build a community… for the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;community-involvement-in-defi&#34;&gt;Community Involvement in DeFi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a while, but now is the time to finally follow through with the thought. As I transition out of my role with Monolith, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to use this extra time to do more community-driven work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, time was all I needed and there is plenty of work to do! Indeed, within a year, DeFi France grew tremendously to become the most active DeFi grassroots group in Europe with now close to 2 000 FR-speaking members on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s what I will be focusing on now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tokenbricexyz&#34;&gt;TokenBrice.xyz
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write a lot of content about DeFi for different companies but sometimes I want to express myself in a lighter tone, with less constraints. I started this blog to have a space that fit my ideals to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideals? Quite simple: I think that &lt;strong&gt;delivering an honest media is extremely difficult if profits must be made, so how about we get them out of the equation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on this blog, I refuse all sponsored posts or promotional activities. All articles are written because I want to do so. I&amp;rsquo;ve also taken extra care to make this blog as privacy-preserving as possible: the cool news with a free blog without ads is that I would have no use of your data anyway, so let&amp;rsquo;s not collect any (but your anonymised IP for article stats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I use an infrastructure where the content lives in a public GitHub repository: for the non-geek &lt;strong&gt;it means that every single change made on tokenbrice.xyz is documented publicly.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no flip-flopping here. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TokenBrice/blog/commits/master&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t trust, verify.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still costs incurred with the blog, mostly the time spent writing and researching as well the occasional illustrations when I feel like my PPT cover graphics are not enough to do the article justice. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;m not counting the hours with this blog, I enjoy updating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you appreciate my work, you can contribute to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/811/tokenbrice-shining-light-on-ethereums-defi-en-fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gitcoin grant&lt;/a&gt; to support it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the approach with this blog in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/hello-world.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this article detailling the infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;defi-france&#34;&gt;DeFi France
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly after the creation of DeFi France, we realized something powerful was happening. With minimal effort, the group was growing fast and the energy in there was amazing (and still is!). Finally, I think we&amp;rsquo;ve got a sense of what the growth of an &amp;ldquo;organic community&amp;rdquo; felt like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several things helped this work, one of the main one being the language: DeFi is so confusing already, so why not discuss it in our native language to make it easier? In the early discussion we could tell &lt;strong&gt;the excitement of chatting about the topic in French&lt;/strong&gt;! As it turned out, there were plenty of Frenchmen in the DeFi space already, all we needed was one place to gather and meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the language component, the other key to the success of DeFi France lies in its community. The Telegram group and the monthly meetups are incredibly successful at one critical thing: to &lt;strong&gt;ensure that the amazing French builders of the DeFi space were accessible to anyone&lt;/strong&gt;, even to someone with no presence in the space. Every month, there is a hangout where you can come, learn from people committed in the space, and meet people (now remote: fucking covid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute here to thanks some of the people who make this community amazing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙏 Pascal Tallarida, Marc Zeller, Alexandre Lourimi, Mosche Malawach, Mat C., Zhytop, McNulty, Jonathan, Dydymoon, Antoine, Fabrice, Florian, Romain &amp;amp; so many others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;defi-france-youtube&#34;&gt;DeFi France (YouTube)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to the existing Telegram group and monthly meetup, we&amp;rsquo;re now growing a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtube.com/c/defifrance&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to offer high-quality content video content about DeFi, still in French. Although I&amp;rsquo;m heavily involved in the shows presenting most of them for now, the vision is to grow the channel and make it accessible to any relevant and passionate producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed &lt;strong&gt;in France, the leading crypto media and YouTubers are running ruthless businesses&lt;/strong&gt;. They do not care about what they are pushing as long as it&amp;rsquo;s profitable. Worse, a fair share don&amp;rsquo;t even care about the factual inaccuracies of their content as long as they produce views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured: can&amp;rsquo;t we establish a community alternative that one day, maybe, will find it way to the crowds too? So here&amp;rsquo;s the hack: we grow a channel, and we make it accessible to other content producers based on expertise, goodwill and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project started a few months ago and is going well on its way! We crossed the 500 subscribers mark and now have 2 recurring emission formats on top of the rediffusion of the DeFi france meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;banklessfr&#34;&gt;BanklessFR
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put BanklessFR right before the last, because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to steal the show here. Credits where they are due: &lt;strong&gt;BanklessFR only exists because of the sustained hard work of Jon who is the editorial director and the main translator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to BanklessFR&amp;rsquo;s story: I&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to Ryan one day to tell him about my bankless-first life (I&amp;rsquo;ve barely touched a non-DeFi financial product in my whole life) and surprise! he was keen - it translated into an article: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-defi-can-pay-for-your-lunches&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;How DeFi Can Pay For Your Lunches?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time (lucky timing is everything), &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://twitter.com/otherbright&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; was emerging in the DeFi France community as one of the most motivated new joins. He started translating several pieces of content into French on his own initiative, including one of mine which led us to talk more about translations. We discussed potential next steps for these efforts, and BanklessFR quickly seemed like an evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve reached back to Ryan and was delighted to find out that it was actually already part of his plans for Bankless to go global! So with the support of Ryan and an initial funding collected thanks to contribution to the Bankless International grant, BanklessFR started on May 27 with the publication of the translation of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://banklessfr.substack.com/p/le-skill-cube-de-bankless&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Skill Cube.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BanklessFR has now been growing since: we&amp;rsquo;re expanding the content offering &amp;amp; exploring different ways to turn this into a sustainable project. After the first Gitcoin grant in September, we just released the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:43413:0x6b40aca108fdb67a781ed4c6810f47f7f3764d00&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;first BanklessFR NFT series&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate an article it&amp;rsquo;s tied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-your-job-brice&#34;&gt;What about your job, Brice?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m recentering on my community-engagement, I&amp;rsquo;m also incredibly excited to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking on a new role. I have a hard time calling it a job considering I&amp;rsquo;d be working with a friend on the amazing product he created: ParaSwap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be helping with the topics pertaining to my expertise such as navigating the density of DeFi space, producing content and documentation, and interacting with the DeFi community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m immensely excited about this new opportunity - as &lt;strong&gt;token swaps are one of those topics that keep getting deeper the more you learn about it&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, ParaSwap is a product working magic behind the scenes, sometimes interacting with several smart contracts and routing trades through several tokens to optimize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the product itself, &lt;strong&gt;the story of ParaSwap is also worth telling&lt;/strong&gt;. After carrying out his project as a one-man-army for months, Mounir assembled an amazing team to take it to the next step. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following attentively since the first day so I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to get the chance to join and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my focus will be to &lt;strong&gt;shine a light on the complexity ParaSwap abstracts for dApp developers and end-users&lt;/strong&gt;. There are so many products and services in the space that it can get very hard to navigate. So I&amp;rsquo;ll be harnessing my expertise and network to identify win-win situations: projects which can harness ParaSwap&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure to improve the quality and operability of their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go for some tidbits of my crypto story! Since you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far, allow to share one last thing - a simple illustration demonstrating some features that make ParaSwap more than a mere aggregator - it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; DeFi middleware:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>🤖 Vaults: DeFi Investing Streamlined?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/vaults-defi-investing-streamlined/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/vaults-defi-investing-streamlined/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/vaults/harvest.gif" alt="Featured image of post 🤖 Vaults: DeFi Investing Streamlined?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the ecosystem of decentralized financial services on Ethereum grows and matures, the service offering is becoming more dense and sometimes hard to understand. While the most technically savvy users can chase the latest releases and hedge their risk appropriately, less-seasoned investors might feel left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are DeFi services made to match the diverse set of investors exploring the space. Yearn Finance was the first platform to pioneer a passive-type of investment products: vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base idea is simple as 1, 2, 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaults are &lt;strong&gt;tokenized investment strategies&lt;/strong&gt;: your deposit is represented by a token (for instance, yCRV in Yearn’s Vault -&amp;gt; yyCRV/yUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vault frequently harvest and re-invest the profits&lt;/strong&gt; (here CRV) to purchase more of the base asset supplied, compounding the returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees are streamlined&lt;/strong&gt;: the depositors do not pay for the gas costs of the vaults operation (such as harvesting). Fees are usually charged while exiting the vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;strong&gt;avoid the headaches&lt;/strong&gt; of chasing the latest farm, managing the claim of the profits you earn, when and how to reinvest them, without forgetting, of course, to account for the gas costs of all these operations in the calculation of your profits, vaults are a credible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaults are made to &lt;strong&gt;abstract the complexity for the end-users&lt;/strong&gt;. You deposit some tokens and wait while they are farming a set strategy for you. So let&amp;rsquo;s see what options are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;.notice{padding:18px;line-height:24px;margin-bottom:24px;border-radius:4px;color:#444;background:#e7f2fa}.notice p:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.notice-title{margin:-18px -18px 12px;padding:4px 18px;border-radius:4px 4px 0 0;font-weight:700;color:#fff;background:#6ab0de}.notice.warning .notice-title{background:rgba(217,83,79,.9)}.notice.warning{background:#fae2e2}.notice.info .notice-title{background:#f0b37e}.notice.info{background:#fff2db}.notice.note .notice-title{background:#6ab0de}.notice.note{background:#e7f2fA}.notice.tip .notice-title{background:rgba(92,184,92,.8)}.notice.tip{background:#e6f9e6}.icon-notice{display:inline-flex;align-self:center;margin-right:8px}.icon-notice img,.icon-notice svg{height:1em;width:1em;fill:currentColor}.icon-notice img,.icon-notice.baseline svg{top:0.125em;position:relative}&lt;/style&gt;

    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;read this piece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For more context on Yearn’s forks, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-waifus.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;check this one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplest-basic-vaults&#34;&gt;Simplest: Basic Vaults
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaults use the token you deposit (DAI for instance) to farm a given strategy, produce a return and re-invest it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneer is of course Yearn with the yCRV vault, but several options are now available or progressively rolling out. This article provides a structured overview of the main earning opportunities enabled by vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, you deposit a given token to earn more of it over time, and potentially additional reward. The tokens you are supplying are not used to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges, &lt;strong&gt;so there is no exposure to impermanent losses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;as more and more vault-types products are being released, you want to take the time to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the one you choose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you will find tables summarizing the main vaults that I know of, with the tokens they accept, the service they farm, and how the return is denominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mention &amp;ldquo;returns normalized to the base&amp;rdquo; means that the strategy generates a return frequently settled for the base token supplied - this operation is sometimes referred to as “harvesting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice tip&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequency of the harvest is important as it will influence the compounding factor of the overall position, as well as level of risk taken on the price of the farmed token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins--btc-vaults&#34;&gt;Stablecoins &amp;amp; BTC Vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vaults, the most common tokens accepted as deposits are stablecoins. Such vaults will deploy your capital on Curve Finance pool to earn CRV tokens, usually the Y pool, . More recent projects, such as Pickle Finance also enables farming from the Curve sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;

    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some services like Harvest or YFV have an incentive model on top of their vault: depositors earn the governance token of the platform (FARM or YFV) on top of the base return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Curve also supports tokenized BTC pools, there are now vaults for them too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FARMS ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;wBTC, renBTC &amp;amp; CRVRENWBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Curve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Curve returns normalized to the base + FARM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;hBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;DFI.Money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Curve?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Rewards normalized to the base&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Harvest.Finance, you can deposit wBTC or renBTC directly, or the CRVRENWBTC token, which represents a deposit in Curve&amp;rsquo;s Pool 5 (RenBTC &amp;amp; wBTC pool).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth-based-vaults&#34;&gt;ETH-Based Vaults
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTC &amp;amp; Stablecoins positions are interesting, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;d like to keep an exposure to the price ETH?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can achieve such a result by yourself by leveraging your ETH. You&amp;rsquo;ll use them as collateral to mint or borrow stablecoins/wBTC that are then deployed to produce a return superior to your borrowing cost: here&amp;rsquo;s an article I wrote providing tips and tools to leverage ETH efficiently - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/leveraging-ETH.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with such a position, you can be exposed to liquidations if the price of ETH was to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Yearn was the pioneer here with the release of the wETH vault that automated this whole process. However, the volume of deposit was massive and the service ran into some technical issues currently being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of waiting for the re-release of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s wETH vault, why not consider the &lt;strong&gt;existing available options&lt;/strong&gt;? They are not as intricate as Yearn&amp;rsquo;s wETH, since they do not leverage your ETH; the ETH is simply deposited somewhere to produce a return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FARMS ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Yearn Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Maker + Curve&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Normalized to ETH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest.Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Cream Deposit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Cream returns normalized to wETH + FARM return (fwETH staking)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;YFV&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Soda&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Soda returns normalized to wETH + VALUE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;DFI.Money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Returns normalized to wETH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve stuck to &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; vaults where you deposit a given token, let it sit for a while, and hopefully walk out of there with more of it (+potentially some governance extra tokens). Yet, the release of Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s UNI token, another kind of riskier vault is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;riskier-uniswap-uni-farming-vaults&#34;&gt;Riskier: Uniswap UNI-farming Vaults
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;uni-farming-basics&#34;&gt;UNI farming basics
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the release of the UNI token came a distribution program instauring UNI incentives on specific pools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/USDC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/USDT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/DAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH/wBTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you provide liquidity on any of the pools listed above, you can stake your liquidity pool token for an additional UNI income directly on Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s website. You&amp;rsquo;ll be earning UNI continuously. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage the position yourself, which means claiming the UNI (and pay the associated gas costs), as well as selling and reinvesting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These strategies are riskier than ETH/BTC/Stablecoins vaults. Indeed, while farming UNI tokens you are providing liquidity on Uniswap, which comes with a risk of impermanent losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why face the hassle of &amp;ldquo;manual farming&amp;rdquo; when you can &lt;strong&gt;let a vault do the hard work for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uni-farming-using-a-vault&#34;&gt;UNI farming using a Vault
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, quickly after the launch of Uniswap, several services started offering vault-type products to streamline the farming of UNI. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOKENS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Harvest&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/USDC, ETH/DAI, ETH/USDT, ETH/wBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + FARM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Pickle Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + PICKLE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;YFV&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;ETH/USDC, ETH/wBTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;UNI returns normalized to the base + VALUE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive. Only vaults are included - services which automatically re-invest the profits for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other opportunities exist to farm UNI, but they require more intervention from your end. For instance, with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://sakeswap.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Sake Swap&lt;/a&gt; you can stake your ETH-Stable Uni-V2 LP tokens to earn both UNI &amp;amp; SAKE tokens. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to claim and manage the SAKE &amp;amp; UNI tokens earned yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about a given vault and how they operate, feel free to check their resources. Yearn and Harvest Finance have great documentation with infographics explaining their vaults:&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/yearn-finances-forks-the-state-of-the-waifus-family/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-waifus/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Yearn Finance&#39;s Forks: The State of the Waifus Family" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day a new Yearn fork is popping up: how to keep track with them? There is no simple answer to this dilemma, however, I believe I can &lt;strong&gt;provide you with some clues to help you spot YFI fork with high potential.&lt;/strong&gt; To do so, I’ll cover three (+1) YFI forks and try to pinpoint the changes to the secret sauce that made them stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn is more than Yearn.Finance product itself: it became a template to kickstart a project, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;fair launch&amp;rdquo;. Yearn pioneered the method which stands on three key elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Mining Fair Launch&lt;/strong&gt;: the initial distribution of the token of the platform (ex: YFI) happens through liquidity mining. Supporters can stake tokens like yCRV to earn the governance token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community-Driven Development&lt;/strong&gt;: the decisions regarding the development of the project are taken by the community of token holders, through informal and formal (on-chain) votes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pooled Investment Strategies (Vaults)&lt;/strong&gt;: the Yearn-inspired projects usually also try to replicate this core feature of Yearn: they offer tokenised investment strategies. The vaults are essential for the long-term success of the project past the initial liquidity mining phase.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Basic Vault&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, where tokens are collected and stake to produce a yield. The yield produced is frequently settled for stablecoins (no leverage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Delegated Vault&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, where once tokens are deposited, they are used as collateral (thanks to credit delegation) to borrow stablecoins then used to produce a return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegated Vaults are much more complex to develop and implement, while basic vaults can be sprung quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfi-wifey-wai-fu&#34;&gt;YFI? Wifey? Wai-fu?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Yearn, people were unclear on how to pronounce &amp;ldquo;YFI&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/t/make-yfi-pronounced-waifu/552&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;A discussion on the governance forum&lt;/a&gt; settled for &amp;ldquo;Wai-fu&amp;rdquo; (/waɪfu/). From this point onward, there was only one wai-fu but plenty of wifeys: the YFI forks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, despite being barely a few months old, &lt;strong&gt;Yearn has already been forked, a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. There is now a whole family of wifeys built upon similar premises, each project adjusting different parameters to attempt to better fit their envisioned use case. Many of these forks were unnecessary, however, &lt;strong&gt;several managed to bring something new and exciting to the table&lt;/strong&gt; —  the ones we will consider today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This content assumes an understanding of Yearn, to brush up on the topic I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;my previous article on Yearn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dfimoney-yfiihttpdfimoney&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://dfi.money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DFI.Money (YFII)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest discussion in Yearn&amp;rsquo;s community was around the &lt;strong&gt;emission schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: while it was initially planned for a week, there were discussions about extending it - most notably &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yips.yearn.finance/YIPS/yip-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YIP 8&lt;/a&gt; which proposed a longer emission schedule halving weekly. &lt;strong&gt;Despite support from the Yearn Community, the proposal did not meet the quorum and was not implemented&lt;/strong&gt;, which lead to the YFII fork** - a fork of YFI implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;instead of having a week-only distribution, YFII opted for a longer schedule, still ongoing.&lt;/strong&gt; It started July 27 and will end on October 5. The farming pools proposed are very similar to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s: staking the yCRV token or staking the Balancer pool token (98%DAI / 2 % YFII).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this base differentiation, YFII develops an interesting angle with a &lt;strong&gt;strong presence in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;: the DFI.Money website was quickly translated into Chinese and soon other languages. There is also a strong &lt;strong&gt;focus on UX&lt;/strong&gt; to make the experience as easy as possible to onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 14, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DfiMoney/status/1305339433638531072?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DFI.Money launched the v2 of their vaults&lt;/a&gt;, supporting ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, TUSD, BUSD, HBTC, &amp;amp; yCRV. As this piece was written, there was a total of $70M deposited into DFI&amp;rsquo;s vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is not an exhaustive overview of YFI forks. There were other forks of Yearn with minimal changes that are not covered, such as YFFI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yflink-yflhttpyflinkio&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://yflink.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFLink (YFL)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFL is another one of the early forks of YFI. Here, the twist is simple:** LINK was used as the base token of the system** - the one to deposit for the initial liquidity mining phase. The farming pools structure was similar to YFI/YFII, but with LINK/aLINK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial vision was to create a farming collaborative for LINK holders. YFL was developed by 5 anonymous teams working together and initially released on August 7 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-waifus/Linkswap.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;YFL LinkSwap&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth was quick and the plan soon refined! YFLink is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@linkswapco/yf-link-ecosystem-linkswap-development-update-44f8413721c9&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;now working on LINKSwap&lt;/a&gt;, a community-governed Automated Market Maker (AMM), focusing on safety and value capture for LINK holders. LINKSwap explores novel ideas to increase investors&amp;rsquo; safety - for instance, the RugLock feature, designed to avoid rug pulls - when the token’s creators drain the liquidity pools, leaving holders with a sizeable bag of worthless coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfvalue-yfvhttpyfvfinance&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://yfv.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFValue (YFV)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFValue adds several more twists, with a similar goal of providing a service facilitating yieldfarming and making it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the farming pools were mostly 98% ERC20-token / 2% YFV Balancer pools and the emission schedule is much longer (5 to 20 weeks) - it&amp;rsquo;s still ongoing while &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/yfv-bringing-true-value-to-yield-farming-bddc4edf889a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFV launched mid-August.&lt;/a&gt; There is also a &amp;ldquo;seed pool&amp;rdquo; accepting stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV was one of the first project to provide credible earning opportunities on tokens such as BAL, YFI, BAT, REN, KNC, BTC, WETH, or LINK: it really helped to attract liquidity — there are around $470 M deposited on YFV as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;YFV Staking Interface&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV&amp;rsquo;s core product, the Governance Vault was just &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/roadmap-update-value-contract-governance-vault-e226ad2f909e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;launched on September 15&lt;/a&gt;. YFV Holders can stake their token for several benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting power in the governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A return paid in vUSD and vETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV token from the emission schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV tokens earned from the strategy implemented with the Governance vaults funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YFV tokens earned from buying back YFV with 6.8% of the profits made with the vaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFV is a highly ambitious project. The vaults (wETH, wBTC, renBTC) are expected shortly. On top of the existing farms and governance structure, the team is working on transitioning to an AMM/farming collaborative called Value Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YFValue is in the process of transitioning to VALUE (token) and Value Liquid (name of the exchange/service). You’ll find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yfv.finance/faq-yfv-and-value-migration-af3a5a5c2190&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;more information on this rebranding and transition here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yfinspired---harvestfinance-farmhttpsharvestfinance&#34;&gt;YFInspired - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://harvest.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Harvest.Finance (FARM)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Harvest.Finance is technically not a fork of Yearn, one could say it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;fork in spirit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, Harvest ambitions to streamline yieldfarming to make it more accessible &amp;amp; it&amp;rsquo;s quite a success: Harvest is now home to more than $200 M (+200 M) of diverse assets farming with no stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience on Harvest is quite straightforward, just like with the Yearn&amp;rsquo;s vault. &lt;strong&gt;Users deposit tokens into the strategy of their choice to put them to work&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, they deposit their DAI to get fDAI, DAI currently farming on Swerve.fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-waifus/harvest-finance.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Harvest Finance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once they own fDAI (or other fTokens), users can stake them to earn FARM - the native token of the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; They can also provide liquidity to the fDAI/DAI pair on Uniswap which facilitates the entry and exit of smaller capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvest.Finance launched on September 15 a new vault accepting for wETH. The community is highly active and committed, and it shows in the reactivity of the team: to better the yield, the stablecoin farms (DAI, USDC, USDT) switched from the Curve strategy to Swerve barely 16 hours after &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://swerve.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Swerve&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-yfi-fork-secret-sauce&#34;&gt;The YFI-Fork Secret Sauce?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope these quick introductions will help to better understand the recipe for a successful YFI fork. Considering the sample size (3+1), it’s hard to draw some conclusions but allow me to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I see a YFI-Fork scoring some resilience points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;focuses on a clearly identified community&lt;/strong&gt; (ex: LINK holders for YFLINK).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol parameters (pools, tokens, etc.) are adjusted to match the target community wants and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A one-week emission schedule was a luxury only affordable by the first Waifu,&lt;/strong&gt; mother of all others (YFI). Successful YFI-forks tend to need a longer schedule (5-20 weeks) to gather and structure their community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A farm by itself is not enough, there is a real need for &lt;strong&gt;a convincing vision for the project in the long-run&lt;/strong&gt;, such as an AMM (YFL/YFV), or going above and beyond on the farming front (Harvest), and more than anything a driven and dedicated community to support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 🧭 DeFi Moneygames: Assessing risk and avoiding wreckage" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based social moneygames are all the rage in decentralised finance. Today, I wanted to write a quick piece to provide some context on them, as well as some tips for those who want to. I&amp;rsquo;ll not pass moral judgement on such projects, I leave it up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of Yearn Finance last month was probably the most significant event of the year for DeFi. If you are not familiar at all with Yearn, check this intro: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yearn-finance-YFI.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - it will be helpful to better understand today&amp;rsquo;s article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s token, YFI was highly innovative back then: 100% of the supply has been distributed to users providing liquidity on different pools tied to the protocol. This launch framework has now become a template replicated by countless projects which spun out in the wake of Yearn&amp;rsquo;s tremendous success: YFII, YFL, YAM, SHRIMP, PASTA, BASED, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this base building block of &amp;ldquo;the farming cooperative&amp;rdquo; provided by Yearn, many projects add a tokonomics twist to their base asset, hoping to make it more sticky. Here are the usual suspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deflationary model&lt;/strong&gt; (this is usually stupid) - &lt;strong&gt;RUN&lt;/strong&gt;. Example: PASTA. (RIP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rebase mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; (it can get interesting - increases information asymmetry). What matters here is finding a relevant price target &amp;amp; making sure the rebase code is not faulty / not leading to issues with other parts of the protocol such as the liquidity pools (Hello YAM). Sadly, it also contributes to turning the game into a ponzi-esque situation where inexperienced investors get plundered by experienced farmers - rebase mechanisms make it tricky to calculate returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social-based mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;, such as a daily/weekly bonus for the top X holders, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Taconomics101&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TACO&lt;/a&gt;, or double rewards every Tuesday because Taco Tuesdays are REAL!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some, the &lt;strong&gt;main value stems from the community angle&lt;/strong&gt; rather than the tokonomics, like for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://shrimp.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Shrimp&lt;/a&gt; which ambitions to become more community-driven than other similar projects by enabling the creation of advanced pool (incentivised in SHRIMP) by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#tip-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a common thread to filter the noise, &lt;strong&gt;governance is a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s a necessity and ultimately a key factor in the success of all these projects&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at the kind of decisions that are made, what is the process, and who is shaping the project, ect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have the base concept and it&amp;rsquo;s so simple and plug and play that we &lt;strong&gt;could create a foodcoin together for the fun&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture $WINE. You farm it by locking DeFi tokens for the first week. Then a WINE/ETH pool will be incentivized for longer (high potential to be a dumping pool, more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WINE is already highly memable and has an emoji, good starting point! However we need more, we need some fun and stickiness to it, how about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top holder has a 20% chance of getting &amp;ldquo;Drunk&amp;rdquo; daily. If that happens, he will be a generous drunkie donating 20% of all his WINE to 100 random daily active addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get too tipsy either: each WINE transaction has a 1% chance of sending 50% of the value transferred to the reward contract instead - increasing the rewards for farmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those mechanisms are profoundly uninspired, but they give you a picture of how easy those concepts are to come by. They can also be implemented very quickly thanks to code blocks (such as the staking contracts) forked from standards (such as Synthetix staking contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#warning-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$WINE does not exist. DO NOT buy $WINE. DO buy wine! 🍷&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough for the context and the theory - I might dive into the community dimensions of the game in the next post. But for today, allow me to share some practical wisdom on these games earned sweating my gwei out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-tips-if-you-are-playing-food-based-moneygames&#34;&gt;Practical tips if you are playing food-based moneygames
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, mind the gas!&lt;/strong&gt; Farming the meme-food coins usually require you to at least stake and then claim/exit. Depending on the pools you are farming you might also have to add liquidity to decentralized exchanges - making the position more intricate and costlier to unfurl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly, NEVER BUY THE FOOD TOKENS - farm them.&lt;/strong&gt; Buying such a token is taking on an incredible amount of risk - you are against an army of people farming them for free who can be eager to dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s get a bit more practical by looking at real examples to explicit the risk scenario of each farming pool types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--1---erc-20-staking-pool---ok-if-the-code-is-safu&#34;&gt;LEVEL = 1 - ERC 20 STAKING POOL - OK IF THE CODE IS SAFU
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With such pools, you stake a DeFi token (usually MKR, COMP, SNX, LEND, wETH and YFI) to earn the meme food token, YAM for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is minimized: if you can compare the staking code with an existing one to ensure there are no shenanigans. Since you&amp;rsquo;re simply staking and not providing liquidity - you&amp;rsquo;re not taking any economic risks. As long as you can ensure the safety of the protocol - your farm capital is not endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past this point (SAFU confirmed), the main risk you are taking is that the coin you are farming might be worth little to nothing by the time you have enough to dump. Stick to reasonable projects to avoid such a scenario known as as the &amp;ldquo;death spiral&amp;rdquo; - when a meme coin enters the final phase of its existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/pasta-deathloop.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;defi-moneygames-PASTA-deathloop&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--2---982-pools&#34;&gt;LEVEL = 2 - 98%/2% POOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pools are usually more tricky, as they involve providing liquidity to a decentralised exchange. Often, they are heavily skewed towards a sound &amp;amp; reputable token: for instance, the YFLink 98% aLINK / 2% YFL pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;strong&gt;you are facing a new type of risk: impermanent losses.&lt;/strong&gt; IL are greatest when the two assets involved in the pool are moving fast in opposite directions, price-wise. 98/2% pools have their own category because they are a bit safer, although they are not fully immune to IL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-moneygames/yfv.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;level--rekt---the-dumping-pools&#34;&gt;LEVEL = REK&amp;rsquo;T - THE DUMPING POOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pools are the MOST dangerous. I&amp;rsquo;d advise anyone needing guidance to simply avoid them - the game is too risky to be played. A great example of why is the PASTA yyCRV / PASTA Uniswap pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put it like this: if some can farm PASTA essentially for free by locking some DeFi tokens - why would they not dump them all for yyCRV, the soundest money-making machine of the industry? That is precisely what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the incentivised pool launched, PASTA farmers dumped heavily to claim those precious yyCRV fools put up for grabs. Why would they not? The price of PASTA tanked from roughly $1 to $0.04, butchering any profit made by those who committed to the pools on top of them losing their precious yyCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what qualifies a pool as the dumping pool? &lt;strong&gt;Allow me to be super explicit here to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not going hara-kiri with your precious tokens&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool is usually 50/50&lt;/strong&gt;: 50 of the meme shitcoin, 50 of a sound asset like ETH, wETH or yyCRV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool is incentivized with a high budget&lt;/strong&gt;- how else would you get plebs to commit? Of course, this profit is hard to realise as most of the capital is lost to IL, and the returns are earned in the foodcoin which can enter the death spiral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dumping pool usually launches a few days after the first ones&lt;/strong&gt;, and last longer. Indeed, you need to give a few days for the farmers to accumulate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m just a simple farmer - follow a legend like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1296619171984232448?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DegenSpartan&lt;/a&gt; - he&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to announce his dumps publicly (shortly) after they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, and remember one thing if you recently joined the space: the food money games are played against experienced traders with years of crypto experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most are 0 sum games: no value is created, it&amp;rsquo;s just a complex 3-4 layers value transfer mechanism.&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you confident enough in your experience to venture into the lions&amp;rsquo; den?&lt;/strong&gt; If not, stand clear of anything past the basic staking pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a financial advisor - you make your own decision. I have no formal training or certification when it comes to investing. I&amp;rsquo;m merely sharing my personal experience with decentralised finance services, with the goal of helping my peers to better understand the value provided by such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am NOT responsible for &lt;u&gt;YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, may they bring you Lambos or bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/yearnfinance-defi-on-autopilot/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/yearnfinance-defi-on-autopilot/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yearn-finance-YFI/wifeys.jpg" alt="Featured image of post YearnFinance - DeFi on autopilot?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Yearn v2 release and the launch of the YFI token (pronounced &amp;ldquo;Waifu&amp;rdquo;) shook decentralised finance. Indeed, the whole recipe was there: Yearn is like a robo advisor, it helps you save and grow a capital - obviously one of the most thought after use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than the product itself, core to defining what Yearn became was its founder Andre Cronje, &lt;strong&gt;his choice of fully opening the governance&lt;/strong&gt;, and the amazing community that soon federated around the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this piece today, I want to share some pointers to understand why Yearn came to be, how it works, and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-yearn&#34;&gt;What is Yearn?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Yearn started with a simple promise: it &lt;strong&gt;helped you get the best lending rate available at any time on a given stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed as there were more and more options to lend stablecoins (Compound, Aave, dYdX, etc.), yield optimization quickly became essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn v2 already brought a new product to the market, the yVaults: they go beyond yield optimization (rebalancing stablecoins between several lending platforms) to provide more returns. Let’s see how this work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;end-user-perspective-deposit-wait-money-go-up&#34;&gt;End-User Perspective: Deposit, Wait, Money go Up
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go in the specifics, here it&amp;rsquo;s how it works for an end-user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You own a token supported in the yVaults, such as LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can deposit your LINK in the yVault to start earning. Entry and exit to the vaults are gas optimised (usually ~$2-3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, you exit the pool. 0.5% of the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; value is taken by the system to cover all the fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;strong&gt;enough time spent in the vault to make up for the exit cost&lt;/strong&gt;, investors walk out with a profit paid in the token they entered (ex: more LINK).&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure you know what you are getting into. Andre has quite an interesting approach, stated in his twitter bio &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1291252150635560960?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;I test in prod&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-happening-under-the-hood&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening under the hood?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;yVaults are amazing because &lt;strong&gt;they abstract an immense amount of complexity for the users,&lt;/strong&gt; and do it better than most of us. Going back to our yLINK vault, here&amp;rsquo;s what happens to provide the yields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINK are deposited on Aave (Credit Delegation) and used as collateral to open positions. The positions are maintained within a safe range using an safety mechanism (funded on the returns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stablecoins are borrowed and put to work to provide a return. The latest strategy farms the mUSD/USDC MTA Balancer Pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any actual returns of the farming portion of the position (stablecoins earned above the debt) are sold for LINK, increasing the effective returns of the whole position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of yVaults is that &lt;strong&gt;they harness DeFi synergies to provide yields on autopilot.&lt;/strong&gt; They are designed to be flexible with their capital allocation - so that it can easily be re-allocated to follow a different strategy with better yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each vault has a different strategy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a neat explainer graphics made to explain the yCRV vault strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining this one would be another article by itself, so I&amp;rsquo;ll let you dig the graph and join the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/HFK5uea&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yearn Discord&lt;/a&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-yearn-is-unlike-anything-else-before&#34;&gt;Why Yearn is unlike anything else before
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is DeFi on steroids, and made possible by developments that occurred over the last year. Yearn is harnessing synergies between several &amp;ldquo;DeFi legos&amp;rdquo;. Without going too deep in, here are the key ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aave recently launched the Credit Delegation feature&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling a contract to open a position on your behalf. This feature was necessary for the yVaults to function as they do now, as they enable the first part of most strategies - getting leverage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEX &amp;amp; Automated Market Makers - especially &lt;strong&gt;Curve.fi&lt;/strong&gt;, an obvious dependency for the yCRV Vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall &lt;strong&gt;dynamism of the stablecoins markets&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to new entrants such as mStable or the COMP token release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn is the perfect example of DeFi composability!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-as-little-as-possible--assembling-legos&#34;&gt;Building as little as possible &amp;amp; assembling legos
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I focusing on this? Because as someone working in the DeFi space for two years, I can tell you that the biggest operational mistake I see ALL THE TIME - is simple: &lt;strong&gt;teams re-building the wheel - reinventing what already exists and working&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think DeFi projects (like most startups) would gain immensely from actively trying to reduce the scope of work they undertake - here are two amazing questions that should be asked more often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the unique value delivered by our product?&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do we need to deliver it? Can we harness existing solutions to achieve this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearn&amp;rsquo;s structural design demonstrates a keen eye to identify high-potential DeFi projects and harness their synergies. In short, by &lt;strong&gt;assembling several DeFi legos together in an unprecedented way&lt;/strong&gt;, Andre efficiently delivered a brand new use case if not a new subset of the whole industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-defi-100-community-driven-project&#34;&gt;The first DeFi 100% community-driven project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This headline is not at attention grab, I stand by it as there is meat on the bone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, let us restress than &lt;strong&gt;Yearn has been a working product handling significant volumes for a while before the YFI token&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, you can add to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% of the tokens distributed to the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a novel liquidity mining approach, pertinent to the product (yCRV pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The community was quick to step up and is booming with well-articulated ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andre relinquished control of the main contracts governing the service, in favour of a multisig with reputable actors of the space.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I regard and value an open governance process as a net positive, at least in the long-run, this is also a risk - and &lt;strong&gt;this is usually how people in the industry reads it&lt;/strong&gt;. An open governance can be hijacked in a direction that does not match the best interest of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defiweb3---communities-hegemonize-brands&#34;&gt;DeFi/Web3 -&amp;gt; Communities Hegemonize Brands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not be on board yet, but for me, building and growing communities - that’s essentially my life. In the years I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it, I found no secret sauce yet I &lt;strong&gt;uncovered an obvious truth: communities &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; brands&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of DeFi, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the &lt;strong&gt;clash of brands&lt;/strong&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re about to witness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, VC-funded brand-companies tend to lack personality and have a harder time bolstering dynamic organic communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, a community-driven project is &lt;strong&gt;a story writing itself every day.&lt;/strong&gt; And when it comes to Yearn&amp;rsquo;s brand, we see it growing fast: the swag is already there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feeling-the-yearn&#34;&gt;Feeling the Yearn
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearn is so much more than yVaults! I focused this explainer on them for clarity, but there are several other Yearn products being developed. Without diving too much in, here some promising ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yborrow.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yBorrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a generalised credit delegation interface using Aave. What makes it amazing is the synergy with the vaults, it will enable anyone to access vaults like yCRV from an ERC-20 token they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ySwap: a novel automated market maker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mysterious leveraged stablecoin-farming solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-yearn-toolbox&#34;&gt;The Yearn ToolBox
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools and resources developed by the community that proves super helpful if you are exploring or using Yearn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.learnyearn.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LearnYearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A comprehensive Yearn wiki frequently updated!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://feel-the-yearn.vercel.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FeelTheYearn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A simple page to get the current status of the vaults: assets locked in, assets deployed and the strategy used for each vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ycosystem.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YCosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A community aggregator to find all the useful links, from docs/YIP to where to purchase Yearn swag!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you are interested in Yearn, I URGE YOU to give the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.yearn.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;governance forum&lt;/a&gt; a read - you are forever invited to read and partake in the discussions shaping Yearn. This time, there is no VC, no BS - just a DAO and a one-man-army named &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Andre Cronje&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wifeys-family&#34;&gt;The Wifeys Family
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it would be dishonest to cover Yearn/YFI &amp;amp; without mentioning that YFI sparked a whole movement - there are now dozens of forks, more or less credible. While the first few ones where just &amp;ldquo;miners fork&amp;rdquo;, adjusting a few parameters, we&amp;rsquo;re now seeing more creative approaches. Indeed, Yearn is open source so easily forkable, and Andre even invited the community to get creative with it&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some communities are forking YFI to create their own pooled earning system, with a longer-term vision. It&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning but I think we will see fascinating development in that space. I think we will see communities reappropriating themselves parts if not the whole YFI system - remember the Wifeys family earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already starting! I&amp;rsquo;m following closely &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/yflink/the-idea-of-yflink-is-born-aa520921a4a3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;YFLink&lt;/a&gt;, a YFI fork adjusted for the needs of the LINK community. Right now, it looks like a farming cooperative, but the end game might be a community staking node - the perfect match!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to the Yearn and its family grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice warning&#34; &gt;

I am not a financial advisor - you make your own decision.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/leveraging-ETH/leveraging-ETH.png" alt="Featured image of post 🎚 ETH exposure or DeFi yields: why choose?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Ether giant seems to be waking up, you might be considering your &lt;strong&gt;options to recenter your exposure on ETH&lt;/strong&gt;. This is precisely what I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at and executed on lately, and now is the time for the feedback session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeFi is heating up and yields are attractive. However, &lt;strong&gt;even crazy liquidity mining returns (on stablecoins) might not beat the ETH price appreciation once its time comes.&lt;/strong&gt; So, instead of having to choose, why not have not both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this one goal in mind, the most obvious solution was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://makerdao.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt;. The position can, of course, be achieved using other services; I consider them at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have the base idea: instead of investing directly in ERC20 or stablecoins and putting them to work, you maintain an ETH base, use it to generate DAI and then diversify into your positions. This way, you maintain a healthy ETH exposure - the tradeoff being the additional risk, including liquidation that are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-investing-the-minted-dai&#34;&gt;Re-investing the minted DAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options to re-invest your DAI are pretty much infinite, so I will focus on these that make the most sense - aka the best at harnessing the current DAI premium. Feel free to check my previous publications covering incentivised liquidity pools investment opportunities &amp;amp; the useful tools to harness them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/defi-farmer-toolbox.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;🧰 The DeFinancial Farming Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially when it comes to what makes of the DAI, you have several options, here are the broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMPLE STABLECOIN RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt; - Put your DAI to work, with a simple deposit on Compound or Aave, or using a yield optimiser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADV. STABLECOIN RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt; - Invest in Curve Ypool for decent returns + extra earning opportunities on your pool tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERC20 EXPOSURE (+LP)&lt;/strong&gt; - Purchase ERC20 tokens and hold or purchase ERC20 tokens and provide liquidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE ETH LEVERAGE&lt;/strong&gt; - Use the DAI to buy more ETH. Can be potentially repeated for more leverage (CAREFUL). This obviously makes the most sense when you&amp;rsquo;re expecting positive price action on ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAI is currently trading at a premium ($~1.03), some strategies are better than others to harness the impact of this spread. I detail them in the last section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vault-management-how-to-increase-gas-efficiency&#34;&gt;Vault Management: How to Increase Gas Efficiency?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making sure you&amp;rsquo;re not burning yourself on the gas costs, I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered several critical tools that we won&amp;rsquo;t detail again, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://zapper.fi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.Fi&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://paraswap.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt; for some token swaps. Today, I want to discuss services that are helpful to manage Maker vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While interacting with your vaults, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself make series of transactions (deposit ETH -&amp;gt; mint DAI -&amp;gt; do something with the DAI). To reduce your gas costs, you can &lt;strong&gt;use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://furucombo.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FuruCombo&lt;/a&gt; to build your series of operations and execute it in one transaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find yourself in need of a &amp;ldquo;flash capital&amp;rdquo; to close a position somewhere and re-open it somewhere else. If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, an Aave flash loan will be useful. Now for the best part: &lt;strong&gt;flash loans are available on FuruCombo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/leveraging-ETH/furucombo.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Collateral swap using Furucombo&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in these times of high gas cost, each interaction is costly. To reduce the impact of gas on your strategy, try to minimize the amount of operations you&amp;rsquo;re doing - FuruCombo is simply amazing for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have many positions to close/open, you might also want to wait for an opportunistic time to do so, where gas costs are low. The weekend evenings (Europe time) are usually best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-please-read-how-to-not-get-liquidated&#34;&gt;🚨 PLEASE READ: How to not get liquidated?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-makers-liquidation-mechanism&#34;&gt;Understanding Maker&amp;rsquo;s Liquidation Mechanism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get liquidated, (a part of) your collateral is seized to cover your debt. &lt;strong&gt;The existence of liquidation on Maker means you could lose potentially all of your ETH&lt;/strong&gt; if you are careless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my tips and recommendations to make sure this does not happen to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are just starting with leverage, maintain a very healthy collateralization ratio&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d recommend &amp;gt; 300 % for new users, simply for peace of mind during your discovery phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t put all of your eggs in one basket&lt;/strong&gt;: on Maker, you can open as many vaults as you want. While you don’t want to open hundreds of positions to keep the gas costs in check, you might also want to consider splitting your stash to not put all of your ETH under the same risk and be able to more gradually manage the positions as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Vault Management&lt;/strong&gt;: if you&amp;rsquo;d like a less stressful approach, you can use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defisaver.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFiSaver&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your vault is automatically kept at a certain ratio with the Save function.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-vault-management&#34;&gt;Advanced Vault Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have several vaults, you can use a tool to re-distribute capital between them in one transaction, again with FuruCombo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Mint DAI on Vault1 (currently safe) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; Burn DAI on Vault2 to lower its risk
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a flash loan, you can even fully close a vault “into” another vault for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Flash loan DAI (=debt of Vault-1) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; Burn on Vault-1, to free the ETH 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Deposit the ETH in Vault-2 (the one you keep) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mint DAI on Vault2 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pay back the flash loan.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful with what you do with the DAI you mint: it&amp;rsquo;s a debt.&lt;/strong&gt; Prefer safer investment options. If you invest in something stupid &amp;amp; get rekt at the same time the ETH price is depreciating, you could be putting your ETH at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-maker-is-the-best-service-to-leverage-eth-right-now&#34;&gt;Why Maker is the best service to leverage ETH right now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus this article on Maker only, considering the angle is to leverage ETH and Maker is currently the best platform to do so, as well as probably the safest (running track record). Here are my main three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fits the bill&lt;/strong&gt; - It enables you to keep an ETH exposure while generating extra DAI to re-invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 fee if not liquidated - (⚠ gas costs)&lt;/strong&gt; The current stability fee is 0 (on ETH) - it costs you nothing but gas to open a position on Maker.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAI Premium -&lt;/strong&gt; DAI is frequently trading at $ 1.02-1.03 meaning minting DAI can result in a 2-3% instant profit on the amounts reinvested (more on this later - DAI premium section).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;this is NOW&lt;/strong&gt;, several weeks from now there might be better options for such positions, as Aave implements its new tokenomics for instance. A similar position could already be achieved today using Compound, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem profitable to do so right now (vs Maker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-this-strategy-for&#34;&gt;Who is this strategy for?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s quite a flexible strategy, &lt;strong&gt;it can be used by pretty much anyone owning ETH and looking for a way to put them to work.&lt;/strong&gt; However, allow me to highlight some use case scenarios that should give you ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve entered the markets recently (2019), and made profits but not really on ETH. While your ERC-20 positions are up, you might be wary about missing on ETH gains. To increase your exposure to ETH, you could settle some of your positions to ETH, open a vault, and reopen up to ⅔ of the closed ERC-20 positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been harnessing neat gains on the stablecoins farming lately, but even the best yields can&amp;rsquo;t beat a waking giant. You might consider buying ETH with your stablecoins, to then open a vault and reopen part of your stablecoin position - you keep some of your yields while adding a sweet exposure to ETH&amp;rsquo;s price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harnessing-the-dai-premium&#34;&gt;Harnessing the DAI Premium
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conclude, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the best options if your goal is to make the most of the current DAI premium - what does it impact most?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it&amp;rsquo;s very nice for ETH-leveraged long. Indeed, if DAI trades at $1.03, buying ETH from DAI is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are considering investing in the Curve y pool, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend going 100% from DAI. You&amp;rsquo;ll save gas cost massively on the swaps that are not required (+ less deposit and approve tx). On top of these savings, entering the Curve y pool fully in DAI usually has a positive price slippage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently it sits ~1.5% over 5000 DAI: that is 1.5% instant profit as you enter the position, quite attractive right?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Curve DAI Premium&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your risk preference and your capital, you might want to time your entry. I was able to harness up to a 3.5% positive bonus entering the ypool, so waiting can be worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-yield-farmer-tier-list/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-yield-farmer-tier-list/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post 💦 The Yield Farmer Tier List" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi is like a layered yield cake. When you first walk through the door, making a deposit on Aave and seeing your balance grow puts you in awe. Shortly thereafter, through your own research or discussions with the community, you realize there is more to it &lt;strong&gt;- there could be icing on the cake too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you could find several streams of yields on a given capital utilizing Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance. &lt;strong&gt;Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll exclude out of the box any strategy involving leverage&lt;/strong&gt; - the easiest way to achieve such a feat. There are still a lot of high-quality crops to plant, even without leverage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, capital efficiency is increasing at a rapid pace in DeFi thanks to novel financial primitives like Compound, Balancer or Curve. It&amp;rsquo;s now possible to &lt;strong&gt;achieve up to 3 layers of returns&lt;/strong&gt;, and there are pools for any risk appetite, from pure stablecoins ones to 100% ERC-20 tokens exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liquidity Wars are merely beginning.&lt;/strong&gt; Follow the governance of the protocol you&amp;rsquo;re invested in closely, it&amp;rsquo;s even more critical now. Meanwhile, since DeFi feels more and more like gaming, allow me to import a concept inherited from there: tier list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In video games, tier lists are useful to navigate the different types of characters or builds. They establish both a typology and a ranking. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll bring this concept back to DeFi to arrange the most attractive liquidity pools into coherent groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-we-start&#34;&gt;BEFORE WE START
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ℹ Please note - This content assumes a basic understanding of the world of Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s decentralized finance. Refer to my earlier articles if that&amp;rsquo;s the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This piece will not cover basic DeFi investment strategies, detailed in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not investment advice and reading this document as anything more than a structured list of incentivised liquidity pools would be a misrepresentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;suggest-yours&#34;&gt;Suggest yours!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post can be a living document. Feel free to suggest incentivised pools I&amp;rsquo;ve missed. If you are familiar with Github, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TokenBrice/blog/blob/master/content/posts/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;you can do a pull request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If not, just reach out and share documentation about the pool and its incentive program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, allow me to make the distinction between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Mining&lt;/strong&gt;: a base action of the platform (such as supply liquidity) is rewarded with the platform native token (ex: BAL on Balancer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Incentive Programs&lt;/strong&gt;: a specific liquidity pool is eligible for extra rewards, through staking of the pool token or weekly distributions (ex: Wednesday for JRT Balancer pools).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is: you can stack both! Let&amp;rsquo;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tier-1-defi-yield-trifecta&#34;&gt;Tier 1: DeFi Yield Trifecta
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I walk you through the main earning-staking opportunities I&amp;rsquo;ve found, I will also share broader considerations about providing liquidity on AMMs, such as thoughts on the pool weighting to help you make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before we chase our wildest dream, the highly-thought-after yield trifecta, let&amp;rsquo;s take a minute to consider what it looks like. When it comes to yields, the cream of the crop is usually an incentivised &amp;amp; balanced Balancer pool with low fees, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s eligible for the maximum amount of BAL liquidity mining rewards, on top of the liquidity incentive program (&amp;amp; the commissions on swaps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is exactly one Balancer pool matching these criteria with 2 stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; to my knowledge, so this is where we start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-50-musd--50-usdc-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;The 50% mUSD / 50% USDC Balancer Pool
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;mstable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a meta-stablecoin. You can go on their app to lock your USDT, USDC, DAI &amp;amp; TUSD to mint mUSD. Once you own mUSD, several earning opportunities are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most direct one is the &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo; feature on the mStable app. It will lock your mStable tokens and generate a return through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/yield-farmer-tier-list/mstable.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;mstable&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s a simple yield and won&amp;rsquo;t deserve a feature here by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect introduction to the Balancer mUSD/USDC pool, our first trifecta of the day. What&amp;rsquo;s a trifecta you ask? Pretty simple: 3 layers of yields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commissions on swaps&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a liquidity pool facilitating trades and earning a fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAL liquidity mining&lt;/strong&gt;- this is a balanced 50/50 pool with low fee (5 bps) earning the maximum amount of BAL possible (mining factor = 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/mstable/introducing-meta-mta-mstables-protocol-token-6e1032291ccf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MTA liquidity incentives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program on this pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;EXPOSURE&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;50% USDC&lt;br/&gt;50 %mUSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Native&lt;br/&gt;BAL&lt;br/&gt;MTA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;June 26 2020&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Variable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;?? BAL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;50 000 MTA/week&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Native rewards = earned in the same token as the exposure (usually a commission fee taken on trades facilitated)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: The respective ratios of four stablecoins backing the mUSD (half of the exposure) can vary, go to the m stable app&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to view it:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;mstable-asset-distribution&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pool is particularly attractive because the exposure is 100% stablecoin-based, despite a very solid yield thanks to the max BAL mining ratio + the incentive program paid in the highly anticipated MTA token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note/Warning: 💬 Discussions are ongoing in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.com/invite/ARJWaeF&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Balancer Discord&lt;/a&gt; governance channel to lower the BAL mining ratio on this pool. It was lowered to 0.1 for tokens tracking the same asset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;90-snx--10-usdc-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;90% SNX / 10% USDC Balancer Pool
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel like you missed out on SNX rise? For medium capitals (&amp;lt; 5000 SNX) it makes little sense to stake if you account for the gas costs. This pool is a great alternative for a bullish SNX exposure with great yield potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;DONE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, since the pool is heavily skewed towards SNX, the BAL mining is not maximized. Remember the factor of 1 for the BAL mining on the mUSD pool? Here it&amp;rsquo;s 0.36: you get about a third of the amount of BAL you would mine in a 50/50 &amp;amp; low-fee pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 90/10 pools are great to heavily minimize impermanent losses risk if you believe the token has a lot of upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;📖Incentive Program Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these two Curve pools have full exposure in a stable (USD) or relatively stable assets (BTC), they are a great resource to &amp;ldquo;park&amp;rdquo; profits realised on more risky ERC-20 based pools. You still &lt;strong&gt;maintain a decent APR on the base asset (~3-5%) while having a nice upside potential on the liquidity mining rewards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tier-3-twofecta-are-nice-too&#34;&gt;Tier 3: Twofecta are nice too!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-favorite-erc-20-balancer-pool&#34;&gt;Your Favorite ERC-20 Balancer Pool
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Balancer exchange comes with built-in BAL mining incentives. They apply to any pool involving whitelisted tokens. Therefore, any Balancer pool is already a twofecta: you&amp;rsquo;re eligible for commissions on the swaps facilitated + the BAL mining rewards. Please keep in mind that the pool weighting (ideally balanced) and fees (ideally low) affect the BAL mining ratio. The table below assume a ratio of 1, observed for instance on 50/50 pairs with 5 bps fees (0.05%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Balancer, Liquidity incentives programs are getting into fashion, expect more to be revealed, as well as liquidity mining programs. You can &lt;strong&gt;use a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pools.fyi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pool FYI&lt;/a&gt; which now has an &amp;ldquo;Incentivised&amp;rdquo; tag to check for the best opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;. For Balancer, use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/balancer/%5B%5D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of COMP, a Compound deposit could also be considered a twofecta. Indeed, on top of the base APR the deposit is earning, users are also now eligible for COMP rewards. You can &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/compound/None&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-risk-breakdown---read-this&#34;&gt;⚠ RISK BREAKDOWN - READ THIS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pool comes with its own sets of risk, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview to help you account for them. When you invest in a liquidity pool, you&amp;rsquo;re assuming the following risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ The base Ethereum network risk (51% attack, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ You&amp;rsquo;re also assuming the risk carried by the token contracts of any token involved in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ As well as the risk involved to the exchange&amp;rsquo;s contracts, which can be hacked or faulty to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/ALWAYS/ An economic risk, the impermanent losses (loss vs raw holding) - that will be heavily affected by your token choices &amp;amp; the pool weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/WHILE ENTERING &amp;amp; EXITING/ The risks associated with any service you use, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;, for the time of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will walk you through the risk profile of one of the pools to help you model it: the mUSD/USDC pool. Just like the returns, the risk profile is a cake with many layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t develop on the Ethereum network risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we have two tokens in the pool: mUSD &amp;amp; USDC. To compute the risk, we need to look at what&amp;rsquo;s backing mUSD - unwrapping, we&amp;rsquo;re exposed to: USDC, USDT, TUSD. Each of these tokens carry their own risks, since for instance &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001314526-Circle-USDC-Risk-Factors&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Circle can freeze USDC balances of any account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we&amp;rsquo;re using Balancer. Their contracts were audited by Trail of Bits recently&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, the protocol is quite recent. We&amp;rsquo;re also relying on mStable contracts for the mUSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re lucky on the impermanent losses - considering the pool involves two stablecoins, the risk is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It all depends on the tools you&amp;rsquo;re using here. Bear in mind that you&amp;rsquo;re also assuming a risk associated with mUSD/Mstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy farming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it here, we will assume a shared basic understanding of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/yield-farming/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;what yield farming is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even have tried it by yourself, or heard the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/tales-from-a-yield-farmer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tales from a yield farmer&lt;/a&gt;: amazing! Today, it’s my turn to share key concepts &amp;amp; a curated list of tools to help you make the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by any chance you landed here without any idea of what &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethhub.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is, please click these links. This is not a guide, I keep it short &amp;amp; sweet with pointers only - Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;organic-defarming&#34;&gt;Organic DeFarming
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farming used to be simple: you planted some seeds and hopefully collected yields. Nowadays, we have some &lt;strong&gt;super crops&lt;/strong&gt;, landing extra yields on top of usual commissions on the swaps facilitated or fees collected on lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Essentially because &lt;strong&gt;some DeFi platforms like Compound or Balancer are now incentivising users to perform actions critical to the service;&lt;/strong&gt; such as supplying liquidity and borrowing for Compound. Their users are rewarded with their native governance token (COMP in this case). Pricing such token is a hard task the markets are currently crunching on. Price stability of these token may take time as they are currently in price discovery mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before we go any further, it’s time to hear a tale from Stani, an organic farmer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed is sustainable farming. In essence, farmers should farm quality crops by bringing quality liquidity for long term and keeping the seeds of these crops to expand their farms to new lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stani Kulechov, Aave&amp;rsquo;s CEO &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1276093091624226816?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll dive deeper into this later, but the overall &lt;strong&gt;high average gas prices are incentivising you to pick solid crops and stick with them&lt;/strong&gt; instead of foraging all around. For more context on liquidity mining, I’d also recommend reading this piece about the SAFG framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally the SAFG shifts us from a world of “buying to own” to one of “participating to govern,” which can ultimately result in more successful protocols and healthier communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-mining-sources&#34;&gt;Liquidity Mining Sources
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the main liquidity mining sources, ordered by the share of tokens available through liquidity mining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancer Labs - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/proposing-balancer-liquidity-mining-cab4503972fa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL&lt;/a&gt; - 100M total supply, 75M distributed through liquidity mining (75%), since June 1 - includes some externally incentivized pools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve Finance - CRV ??? - there is currently little to no public information available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound Finance - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;COMP&lt;/a&gt; - 10M total supply, ~4.2M through liquidity mining (42%), since June 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal Market Access - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defirate.com/safg/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UMA&lt;/a&gt; ~ 35% of the supply through mining (details TBD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetix &amp;amp; other incentives program (like JRT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jarvis x Aave &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sponsoring.jarvis.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adapting-the-strategy-to-your-budget&#34;&gt;Adapting the strategy to your budget
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we see how to get in and out of such positions, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a quick discussion on gas prices. They have been pretty high lately in a 25-35 gwei/fast range. Here&amp;rsquo;s roughly what it means for common operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Compound ($2-3 gas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Liquidity Pools @Zapper, an all-in-one tool to handle your liquidity providing positions, more on this below ($3-5 + swap fees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit @Liquidity Pools &amp;ldquo;manually&amp;rdquo; ($0.3 (approve) + $2-3 as many times as tokens as in the pool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exiting also has a cost, as well as any token swap required (like selling your COMP while exiting your position) $1-3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-cold-hard-look-at-gas-cost-impact-on-medium-capitals--2000&#34;&gt;A cold hard look at gas cost impact on medium capitals ($ 2000)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the returns over time of a 2 000 USDT Deposit @Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep this simple, we assume the current parameters will stay as such for the next year. &lt;strong&gt;This is obviously unrealistic - take this as a thought experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; Here were the parameters at the time of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4% APY on USDT on Compound = $80 for a year on the capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.66 COMP/year =~$150 produced by our capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table below, the &amp;ldquo;Actual Profits&amp;rdquo; column corresponds to a total exit of the position (back to USDT), which means effectively 3 transactions overall for the operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplying on Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawing on Compound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling the COMP tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we look at this position with these assumptions over several time frames, here is what we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Timeframe&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Total Return ($)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Actual Profits ($)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Effective % return over the timeframe&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 day&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$0.63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-$8.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-0.42%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 week&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$4.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-$4.58&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;-0.23%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1 month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$23.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$14.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.70%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;3 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$57.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$48.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;2.43%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;6 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$115.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$106.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;A year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$230.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;$221.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;11.05%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: This simplistic scenario ignores the opportunity cost on ETH price. $5 of gas (=ETH) paid today might be worth $10 a year from now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning here I wanted to share is that &lt;strong&gt;for such capitals, considering the current gas costs, it will probably be better to stick to a position for months instead of trying to chase the best currently available yield&lt;/strong&gt;. Decent profits (~0.81 % /month) starts around the 3-months timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, remember Stani the farmer? You need to pick your crops wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;whales-playground---10-000&#34;&gt;Whale&amp;rsquo;s Playground (&amp;gt; $ 10 000)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if you have more skin in the game and are willing to take more exposure, gas costs become less prohibitive and there are more options available to you. I won&amp;rsquo;t expand on these, some pointers will be enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can leverage your Compound exposure to maximize your effective COMP mining (through supply/borrow). It obviously comes with a risk of liquidation. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dsa.instadapp.io/compound&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;InstaDapp&lt;/a&gt; helps you maximize COMP returns by folding your position up to 4x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, I&amp;rsquo;ve detailed a strategy built on the Synthetix platform which included another form of small leverage. It observed impressive returns (~200% effectively) since &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2020/definancial-services-guide/#5-a-the-synthetixcurve-yieldstack-aka-the-4-steaks-yieldburger&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduced 5 weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; - mostly due to a significant appreciation of the price of SNX, the largest exposure in this strategy and the very high level of activity on the Curve sUSD pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough prep - you are now an advised farmer - congrats! Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the tools used to plant your seed, secure your crops and harvest your yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-in-and-out-of-positions&#34;&gt;Getting in and out of positions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get into liquidity pools “manually”, that is directly on each platform. It will require several transactions and a proportionate amount of a least two tokens, to begin with. If not, you will also have to swap accordingly beforehand, using a service like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. ParaSwap also helps you get into tokens like cDAI (interest-bearing DAI from Compound) from any other ERC20 with gas and price-efficient paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Balancer just add the option to enter a liquidity pool from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/1276958110024896514?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;just one token&lt;/a&gt; (-&amp;gt; getting up to 8 tokens from 1, watch for slippage!).&lt;/em&gt; 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not the most familiar with Ethereum yet, the easiest way for you to partake in this feast would be to use tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/defi-farmer-toolbox/zapper-fi.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting in and out of pools&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;: in the Invest tab, Zapper lets you conveniently get into/out of pools on Balancer, Curve, and Uniswap, from ETH, DAI and a few other tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying ETH &amp;amp; using DeFi services&lt;/strong&gt; like Aave (gas free on Aave for now!) - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://argent.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Argent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending ETH &amp;amp; stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt;. Now with ParaSwap built-in for swaps and soon an on-ramp to buy ETH/ERC-20 from your bank account!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, here’s a quick tip because I see this way too much.
&lt;strong&gt;You should never claim on Compound.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s costly and your COMP tokens are automatically claimed every time you adjust your position by depositing or withdrawing assets (minimal amount of COMP claimable required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-definancial-farmers-essential-toolbox&#34;&gt;The DeFinancial Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Essential Toolbox
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve explained  the basics dear organic farmers, it’s time to finally have a look at that promised toolbox. You&amp;rsquo;ll find below tools that help you track your positions and the markets &amp;amp; analyse the potential returns of strategies you think about applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of helping you zap in/out of pools, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapper.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zapper.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an amazing all-in-one DeFi position tracker. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zapper.fi/synthetix?address=0x4E60bE84870FE6AE350B563A121042396Abe1eaF&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the Zapper of the wallet&lt;/a&gt; of the legendary farmer &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetix / Yearn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many pools and opportunities, it can be hard to keep track! Luckily, some really neat yield farmer tools are being developped. For Synthetix and Yearn.Finance especially, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yieldfarming.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yieldfarming.info&lt;/a&gt; is a neat ressource&lt;/strong&gt; to keep track of both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/JMB9bYfVUtMAPHM5moj7aIjLaDwos2k9JjJTtk64&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;overview of the COMP tokens mining &amp;amp; claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; here. Use this tool to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/compound/None&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;calculate the expected COMP returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; obtained by supplying or borrowing tokens on Compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Compound, you can estimate your BAL mining: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.predictions.exchange/balancer/%5B%5D&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL Distribution Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you intend to use Balancer, I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend brushing up on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/striking-a-balancer-the-daily-gwei&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BAL token distribution early shenanigans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RealT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity mining returns are quite variable, so on the side you might want to consider tokenised real estate for more predictable returns with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://realt.co&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keeping-track-with-the-defi-news&#34;&gt;Keeping track with the DeFi news
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more on DeFi, here are a few resources I&amp;rsquo;d recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;The Daily Gwei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a short and sweet daily read on a key event/release
-&amp;amp; you can find me discussing DeFi every week with my friend Abel here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://abelsabstracts.substack.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Abel Abstracts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-words&#34;&gt;Parting Words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s Gitcoin grant season so please indulge this closure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been in the space for a bit, hopefully even making some profits? How about sharing a small share back, let&amp;rsquo;s say 2 %, to critical infrastructure projects and to support your favourite DeFi services or content producers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contributions are immensely appreciated and can have a great impact, even for just 1 DAI thanks to the CLR matching. So if you liked this piece or my contributions to the DeFi space overall, feel free to have a look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/811/tokenbrice-shining-light-on-ethereums-defi-en-fr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my Gitcoin grant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will help me fund more initiatives for the French community &amp;amp; help to go on with content production efforts like this one. Every contribution makes a difference, even 1 DAI (currently matched +5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are on Gitcoin with a grant in your basket, why not add more? Feel free to look around and support critical initiatives, from vulgarisation efforts to core research. Remember the gas struggles? You can &lt;strong&gt;donate to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitcoin.co/grants/946/project-title-eip-1559-community-fund&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EIP 1559 Community Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to help on that front too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 10:53:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-make-definancial-products-work-for-you/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post 📖 How to make DeFinancial products work for you" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new economic paradigm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you landed here, you probably already have heard about Ethereum and even decentralised finance (DeFi). That&amp;rsquo;s great - today we take it to the next step: how to use DeFi to better your personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article walks you through 6 base strategies and their variants that harness the most relevant DeFinancial services. We start with the &amp;ldquo;set and forget&amp;rdquo; strategies and progressively move down the stack towards the more complex but also lucrative ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the strategies, I URGE you to read attentively the primer on gas below &amp;amp; as well as the disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is not investment advice. I am not an accredited investor or asset manager. I am just a 27 year old dude using DeFinancial services abundantly and highly active in the space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-primer-on-gas&#34;&gt;A primer on gas
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ If you know what gas is, feel free to ignore, else - please read this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All strategies described here are enabled thanks to decentralised finance services and executed on the Ethereum network. &lt;strong&gt;To interact with DeFi services, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for the commons of the Ethereum network - and that&amp;rsquo;s what gas costs are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas costs are paid in gwei, a subunit of ETH (1 gwei =  0.000000001 ETH). Most Ethereum wallets will suggest a default gas price. That&amp;rsquo;s usually enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as you dive deeper into the arcane of DeFi, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself coming back to gas to understand it better and optimise your transaction costs. Indeed, depending on the gas cost you pick (vs network observed one), your transaction will clear quickly, slowly, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ethgasstation.info/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check recommended gas prices on ⛽ EthGasStation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;📑 EthHub Docs on Ethereum Transactions&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some strategies listed below (1, 3 &amp;amp; 4) are applicable without having to worry about gas, using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://argent.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re almost ready to go in! I just have some necessary disclaimers to share with you to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re on the same level &amp;amp; you understand the content presented below for what it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;necessary-reminders---please-read&#34;&gt;Necessary reminders - PLEASE READ
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All returns discussed in the articles are yearly APR (Annual Percentage Rate)&lt;/strong&gt; - to realise these APR (assuming the estimation is accurate), you need to hold your position for a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no objective measurements of complexity or risk&lt;/strong&gt; - the parameters I present you with while introducing a strategy are here for understanding only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; represent? A chance of losing your assets due to market events or your own shortcomings (usually stemming from a lack of understanding)  &lt;br&gt;
The &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; score gives you an idea of how technical and hard the risk is to understand and estimate.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please note: the risk of a failure at the Ethereum network-level is not equal to 0. I do not mention this risk again below - it&amp;rsquo;s implied as a base-level of risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no free lunches: be sensible with your decisions, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;quick rule of  thumb &amp;ldquo;the higher the APR, the higher the risk&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When markets go wild (either way), some products are affected more than others. While a sudden ETH price variation doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact RealT&amp;rsquo;s APR (2) - it can translate into significant losses for users of TokenSets or liquidity providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, keep in mind that most of the APR mentioned below change quite often. Don&amp;rsquo;t take them as such, especially if you read this piece weeks after its release: double check by yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re considering committing capital to a given project, &lt;strong&gt;I URGE YOU&lt;/strong&gt; to check the following ressources to learn more on their risk model &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.defiscore.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;passive-definancial-services&#34;&gt;PASSIVE DEFINANCIAL SERVICES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Products 1-4 are &amp;ldquo;set and forget&amp;rdquo; (please monitor your positions still). What&amp;rsquo;s meant is that entry is usually done through a simple purchase/swap - and so is the exit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, in between the two, you have nothing to do to earn your yield - it&amp;rsquo;s paid to you without requiring any intervention (claim or other).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;with-stable-assets&#34;&gt;With Stable Assets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some passive investment products involve only stablecoins - these are tokens tracking the price of a stable currency, usually the dollar. Considering the minimal amount of work required to use them, and the lower overall risk (mostly technical failure) these products are the best to get you started with decentralised finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-stablecoins-yield&#34;&gt;1/ Stablecoins Yield
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own an Ethereum-based asset tracking the price of the dollar (ex: DAI). You find a way for this asset to earn interest: lending (ex: aDAI) or liquidity providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1 = lowest, 5 = highest)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/1-stablecoin-yield.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;1-stablecoin-yield&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield-bearing stablecoins are the gateway drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can provide decent returns (up to 8-9% APR), are convenient to use and also not too complex so they are a good start to understand some fundamentals about DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting in and out is as easy as swapping a token. So, if while considering this approach, you only have three things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: base stablecoin risk (on DAI) + any service on top of it (ex: Aave for aDAI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return: there are some neat ressources to keep track with the yields, check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://loanscan.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;LoanScan&lt;/a&gt; for instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas costs to get in &amp;amp; out (especially &lt;strong&gt;if you invest small amounts, or while the network is busy&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement this first strategy, you have several options: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://compound.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;, etc. You can acquire their corresponding tokens (cDAI, aDAI, iDAI) using a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://paraswap.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ParaSwap&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of APR, historically, aDAI has been consistently topping the charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to expand on top of the base concept, you have several options offering better returns (meaning more risk):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-a-implementing-a-basic-stablecoin-yield-based-strategy&#34;&gt;1-A/ Implementing a basic stablecoin-yield based strategy
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECAP: You own an Ethereum-based asset dynamically rebalancing between several stablecoins providing yields to optimise your return.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, there are several services offering stablecoins providing returns thanks to lending pools. You can manually chase the best rate yourself, but will require you to monitor the rates and do the rebalances yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, why not use an Ethereum native service to do that for you in full transparency? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://idle.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Idle Finance&lt;/a&gt; is the leading solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-b-stablecoins-liquidity-providing-curve-pools&#34;&gt;1-B/ Stablecoins Liquidity Providing: Curve Pools
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own several Ethereum-based stablecoins and help facilitate trades on Curve (= liquidity provider). You earn a commission on each trade corresponding to the prorata of your share of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a dedicated section about liquidity pools below but I had to mention the Curve Pools here. In a gist, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://curve.fi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Curve&lt;/a&gt; is a service made to optimize stablecoin swaps. Providing liquidity on Curve can be quite attractive since the base assets are all stablecoins &amp;amp; the returns provided by the commissions collected on the swaps (&amp;amp; lending) are decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-c--no-loss-lottery-pool-together&#34;&gt;1-C / No loss lottery: Pool Together
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lock a stablecoin (DAI or USDC) for a week or a month. They are pooled with other users&amp;rsquo; to generate interest (-&amp;gt;Compound). At the end of the week/month, the winner gets all the interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this one because it&amp;rsquo;s both surprising to see it here and amazing. So first, let me clear the air: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether&lt;/a&gt; is not a financial product per-se - their vision is more pedagogic: PoolTogether is a money game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is quite simple, as described in the recap. Since all the profits of the winner are generated on the interests of all players, nobody loses any money with PoolTogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However please rest assured, the addition of PoolTogether in this list is not ideological: **average returns are superior to Compound. &lt;strong&gt;The reason why is quite simple: PoolTogether uses Compound to generate its return (= same APR) + each pool has some &amp;ldquo;sponsored&amp;rdquo; ticket - tickets contributing to the interest accrual, but without winning chances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/pt-sponsored.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pool-together-sponsored-balances&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the average APR is higher, please bear in mind that PoolTogether is much less regular - most of the time you&amp;rsquo;ll get nothing, but if you win you get the equivalent of years of interest on your capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoolTogether essentially provides a new flavor of interest distribution on top of Compound&amp;rsquo;s return: PT&amp;rsquo;s returns are much more random but also potentially massive (if lucky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/pooltogether/winning-more-prizes-185bad7f6d63&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PoolTogether released the pods&lt;/a&gt; - a new option for users to play as a group. Users can now share their odds and their gains - which makes the wins less significant but much more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pooltogether.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;You can play the PoolTogether lottery directly from their website.&lt;/a&gt; You&amp;rsquo;ll need some DAI or USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-tokenized-real-estate---realt&#34;&gt;2/ Tokenized Real Estate - RealT
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own shares of tokenized properties (securities). You earn your share of the rent daily (currently in USDC) + extra earning opportunities (liquidity providing, incentive programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/2-tokenised-real-estate.jpeg&#34;

    &gt;RealT&lt;/a&gt; is a totally different beast from anything else in that list, at several levels&lt;/strong&gt;. Since RealT tokens represents real estate in the real world, the risk profile is also totally different (~~&amp;gt;  less Ethereum risk, more real-word risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into what makes RealT tokens so interesting, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure we are clear. &lt;strong&gt;RealT tokens are securities - you have to go through a KYC process to be able to purchase them&lt;/strong&gt; (whitelist + lease agreement).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more work than for interest-bearing stablecoins, but you have several benefits to gain here compared to strategy 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;: depending on the property, APR ranges from 8% to 12.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily payment of returns&lt;/strong&gt;: once you have some RealT tokens in your wallet, you will receive your corresponding** share of the rent, daily, in USDC**.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedging&lt;/strong&gt;: you have a yield based on real estate - AKA less correlated to the rest of the crypto markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;: you can add more to this strategy to increase the return. To do so, consider providing liquidity on Uniswap - generating some returns. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/realtplatform/announcing-the-uniswap-incentive-program-f82f721cf63a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Providing liquidity on RealT tokens is currently incentivised&lt;/a&gt; - landing even more returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-automated-trading-strategies---tokensets&#34;&gt;3/ Automated Trading Strategies - TokenSets
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own a &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; representing a stake in an automated trading strategy based on a technical indicator or another trader (social sets) a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Holding on autopilot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;TokenSets&lt;/a&gt; are the holders&amp;rsquo; best friend&lt;/strong&gt;. While the service is definitely not the easiest to understand or the less risky, it currently provides significant utility. Indeed, if you are a long term holder of ETH for instance, TokenSets is one of your best options to grow your ETH stash (against ETH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sets are automated trading strategies represented by a token. Each set trades a given pair (ex: ETH/cUSDC) following a pre-set of rebalancing rules triggered by the cross with the set technical indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;TokenViz&lt;/a&gt; provides a neat dashboard to help you chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a user who is not willing to look at charts all day, TokenSets is an excellent option. Indeed, most people trying to trade tend to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;With the sets, the emotions are out &amp;amp; machines rule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the regular sets following a technical indicator (such as ETH 20 Days Moving Average), there are now social sets. It&amp;rsquo;s the same mechanism, but your set will follow another&amp;rsquo;s trader strategy instead of simple technical indicators: aka &amp;ldquo;copy-trader&amp;rdquo; feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-simple-yields-to-chase-on-erc20-tokens&#34;&gt;4/ Simple yields to chase on ERC20 tokens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the ERC-20 version of strategy 1: you own an ERC-20 (non-stable) token producing some form of returns, usually through lending or liquidity providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/4-erc20-yields.jpeg&#34;

		alt=&#34;4-erc20-yields&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we explore the more active approaches, allow me to introduce one more passive approach, this time based on ERC20 tokens (not stablecoins.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Aave offers aTokens on up to 15 different ERC-20 tokens, it might be worth for you to keep an eye on them - with a tool like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aavewatch.now.sh/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AaveWatch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them, I think the following are the most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aSNX: base rate around 7%, can spike quite high for a bit - keep a very close eye to this one on Wednesdays, especially if prices of ETH/SNX crashed during the week: we observe SNX borrowing surges during certain claim periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asUSD: can spikes quite hard too, especially lately (~12% APR over the last month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aZRX: rates can spike, read more about ZRX to know when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aMANA: same here - decentish rate (1-2%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing nothing is amazing - and when it comes to investing it’s a strategy that can be surprisingly effective&lt;/strong&gt;. Being able to stand still and do nothing, even in the middle of a marketstorm is truly an art you would gain to master. However, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise for you: the best yield will require effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how I didn&amp;rsquo;t say work? Sometimes, the &amp;ldquo;efforts&amp;rdquo; can simply be that you accept to stomach a risk others wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and get paid nicely for it &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;the investor equivalent of a stunt double.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next strategies will require a more precise understanding of what you are doing. Indeed, at their core, all strategies would benefit immensely from your market acumen. So before we explore such strategies, allow me some reminders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information is power.&lt;/strong&gt; More specifically for DeFi investing: the information you have &amp;amp; understand is the main thing driving the alpha (returns) you&amp;rsquo;re extracting from the markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it slow, be safe, it&amp;rsquo;s not a race&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite writing this article (with many people advising), I have yet to use strategy 6 with serious amounts of capital for instance. It&amp;rsquo;s wise to double-check your understanding of a given platform every time you increase your stake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to quickstart the process? Go in with $50.&lt;/strong&gt; Small amounts are amazing to help you understand a protocol and be involved without taking too many risks and stressing about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-pointers-on-passive-vs-active-styles&#34;&gt;Some pointers on passive vs active styles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to give an accurate representation of the potential earning spread between an average DeFi passive investor and an active one. However, a combination of services reproduces a similar situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetix: SNX staking model to collateralise synthetic assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aave + Synthetix = aSNX Passive (type 4) investment asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Expected Yearly Return &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Passive Style (aSNX)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;None (once you own aSNX)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;~10%&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Active Style (SNX stake managed through mintr)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;Weekly claim of reward (1y escrowed) + sUSD + synths management strategy (trading, liquidity+staking)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;~80% &amp; more (up to you)&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-synthetix&#34;&gt;5/ Synthetix
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with a stake of SNX (Synthetix token). You stake (lock) them which already generates a neat SNX return but vested for a year (+weekly sUSD non-vested). Thanks to your stake, you can then mint synthetic tokens - that expose yourself for up to 1/8 of the initial SNX value &amp;amp; offer additional earning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		alt=&#34;5-synthetix&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything else: what I say below is NOT ENOUGH to understand Synthetix+SNX if you are just discovering it. &lt;strong&gt;Do not rush it!&lt;/strong&gt; Synthetix is definitely a next step in terms of complexity, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of all the new things you will have to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a secured wallet - &lt;strong&gt;will you be able to access your wallet in a year?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
SNX rewards are escrowed a year: you claim them today, but you can only move them out of Mintr (Synthetix platform) a year after the claim date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim reward weekly&lt;/strong&gt; (SNX vested for a year + sUSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; your collateralization ratio and adjust when need to be able to claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide&lt;/strong&gt; which Synth you&amp;rsquo;re exposing yourself to and when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Synthetix is really flexible, allow me to stick to a strategy I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully implemented. Other approaches are possible, and my choice is suggestive. However, I think this strategy does a good job at highlighting the different synergies available with Synthetix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;5-a-the-synthetixcurve-yieldstack-aka-the-4-steaks-yieldburger&#34;&gt;5-A/ The Synthetix/Curve YieldStack (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;the 4-steaks yieldburger&amp;rdquo;)
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use Synthetix (+SNX) to mint sUSD, a stablecoin, and supply this stablecoin to an incentivised liquidity pool for extra returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not beat around the bush: this is much harder, much more work than 1-4, but the returns are an order of magnitude higher if done right. Your position is also more complex to monitor since you are exposed to several types of assets, getting returns in several kinds of assets too, and the timeline of the returns are not the same either.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stake? Steak? Does it matter as long as there is meat on the bone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the base of the yield stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staking SNX + SNX reward&lt;/strong&gt; ~ 50% APR, in SNX, paid weekly (claim required) &amp;amp; vested for a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sUSD Staking reward&lt;/strong&gt; - variable sUSD reward (based on exchanges volume), paid weekly, claim required, no vesting period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Provider Curve sUSD pool&lt;/strong&gt; - 3 to 5% APR, earned while exiting the pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentive Program&lt;/strong&gt; for that pool (accessed by staking the pool token)-  25% APR, in SNX, paid weekly (claim required), no vesting period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The Curve sUSD pool ran into some issues, and the current live version is not the most optimised one for returns. A new version of the sUSD pool is coming up, harnessing Aave to optimize it even farther. This strategy might get even more compelling as soon as this ships!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious ? Here is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://synthetix.community/docs/intro&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;comprehensive overview to get started with Synthetix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-liquidity-provider-not-on-stablecoins&#34;&gt;6/ Liquidity Provider (not on stablecoins)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use a capital equally split into to tokens (ex 50% ETH 50% DAI) to supply a liquidity pool, which generates commissions on the trade you help facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/definancial-services-guide/subh/6-liquidity-provider.jpeg&#34;

		alt=&#34;6-liquidity-provider&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a riskier variant of the strategy 1-B. In this scenario, you are still providing liquidity but this time you move to another kind of pair - the ETH based ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you provide liquidity on a decentralised exchange, the main risk you face (on top of the usual) is what we call &amp;ldquo;impermanent losses&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. (confusing name, they are very permanent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t explain the full concept here, but here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap: &lt;strong&gt;impermanent losses usually stem from a sudden variation between the relative prices of the two assets you&amp;rsquo;re providing liquidity to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if the two assets are tracking the same price (ex ETH/sETH), the impermanent loss risk is minimized&lt;/strong&gt;. So, from the lower level of risk, to greater, you have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on stablecoins: both assets prices are relatively stable, and they track the same price =&amp;gt; the impermanent losses risk is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on assets that are not stable but tracking the same price, such as ETH/sETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on an ETH/stable pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing liquidity on a ETH/ERC20 (both non stable &amp;amp; not tracking the same price) - this is where the risk is greater, since both assets can move - if both assets price were to suddenly move in opposite directions you can suffer significant impermanent losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are considering providing liquidity on AMMs, please read more on the topic: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Risk/Reward of liquidity provision in AMMs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/a-cold-look-at-decentralized-finance-mass-adoption-introducing-the-great-defi-filter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/great-defi-filter/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post A cold look at decentralized finance mass adoption: introducing the Great DeFi Filter" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the industry the question of adoption is so recurring it now almost triggers an automatic answer leading to a boilerplate response: &amp;ldquo;something about UX, something scalability&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, &amp;ldquo;something about privacy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as my usual, I&amp;rsquo;d like to bring to your attention a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-great-defi-filter&#34;&gt;The Great DeFi Filter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be a bit hard to hear for the bulls amongst us, but &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think DeFi is ready for mass audiences just yet&lt;/strong&gt;. From an outsider perspective, onboarding an Ethereum DApp is an exhausting adventure involving learnings in several disciplines and at least a basic understanding of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the numbers of steps and their complexity are reducing by day — the products are becoming more comfortable to use. However, &lt;strong&gt;usage is not the north star metric here: understanding is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still quite a steep learning curve before being able to use DeFi the smart way. &lt;strong&gt;This research and documentation phase is often too much work for most — this is the first layer of the filter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were an economic model, we would probably throw a &amp;ldquo;rational assumption&amp;rdquo; here and conclude that all users going past this point documented themselves and understand what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the real world, so let me give you a peek of mundanity: through my daily interactions, I run into some users interacting with services they do not understand. Most of the times, they haven&amp;rsquo;t committed too much, and their situation is salvageable, but sometimes the stakes are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;great-filter-or-great-safety-net&#34;&gt;Great Filter or Great Safety Net?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the filter better, we need to look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening in legacy finance. In the good old banking and finance industry, the learning curve is much less steep. Indeed, you usually have &lt;strong&gt;several intermediaries offering neatly packaged and easy to use products&lt;/strong&gt;: they abstract things for the user while the user of DeFi services is still doing a lot of the nitty-gritty work himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;these intermediaries also play their own game&lt;/strong&gt; - their goals can easily conflict with their users&amp;rsquo; best interest. For instance, if a banking service has its own saving-account product, it can become a form of incentive for them to mislead their users and push them towards it (instead of potential better options @competitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before we look at different options to lift the filter, I&amp;rsquo;ll close the loop with decentralised finance. The Great Filter I&amp;rsquo;m cornering is also a form of great safety net: everything is transparent and happening on-chain. After a bit of learning, anybody can read the same base data, process it, and be informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that the &lt;em&gt;Great Filter&lt;/em&gt; will only be lifted with a concerted effort from both sides: users of DeFi services and their builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lift-the-filter-by-championing-your-favourite-projects&#34;&gt;Lift the filter by championing your favourite projects
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need more effort from the community - that&amp;rsquo;s you - to explain what is happening with all the different DeFi services. The amount of complexity involved is still massive, and we need more than ever content of the highest quality — videos, infographics, articles, you name it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, a &lt;strong&gt;high-quality DeFi post goes beyond just explaining: it sparks its readers&amp;rsquo; curiosity and leave them hungry for more&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want some help to get involved on this front,&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tokenbrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt; please reach out&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d be more than happy to give you some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m at it, let me address another recurring myth: &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t need to code to contribute to decentralized finance projects&lt;/strong&gt;. You can be delivering as much value, if not more, doing any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboarding family &amp;amp; friends: that&amp;rsquo;s quite obvious, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve found value in DeFi services, why could they not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you speak another language? Feel free to reach out to your favourite projects to help them translate their interface, support &amp;amp; other written content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can draw, on paper or digitally? Make a neat infographic of a system you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re the king of the opps? Get involved with your local meetups and help them organize!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got video or audio editing skills? You&amp;rsquo;re going to have many friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;builders-using-new-devices-to-solve-an-unprecedented-ux-challenge&#34;&gt;Builders: using new devices to solve an unprecedented UX challenge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I wrap this up, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the second side, the builders. UX of the Dapps is obviously a significant challenge - but why is that so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that as an industry, we&amp;rsquo;re still quite user-shy. We see again and again projects being developed in an Ivory Tower, and then unleashed to the crowds by their creators, full of hope &amp;amp; dreams - ready to be crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought the tech by itself was enough - insider tip: it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now accounting for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that we are building &lt;strong&gt;services operating in a manner never seen before&lt;/strong&gt;: transparent, interoperable, and more or less trustless thanks to decentralized or distributed networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only their operations are novel — these services are already delivering &lt;strong&gt;use cases that previously did not exist anywhere else&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are at the avant-garde and must try our best to make sure decentralized finance lives to our ideals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we should consider radically novel ways of approaching DeFi services design&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to bring all kind of perspectives, try weird and new stuff again and again until we crack the nut and figure out the tools most fitted to our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tkb-x-tkb-using-linguistics-to-improve-dapp-ux&#34;&gt;TkB x TkB: Using linguistics to improve dApp UX
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, at my level, I went back to my first loves: literature and linguistics and thought about how to use them to better the UX of a DeFi wallet. I did a quick trial run on the onboarding of the Monolith wallet — the results are insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find them here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TokenBrice/blog/blob/master/static/others/monolith-semantic-analysis.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Hello, World!</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/hello-world/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 14:53:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/hello-world/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/hello-world/infrastructure-fr.png" alt="Featured image of post Hello, World!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my humble domain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to take this project live. As often with me, what started as a simple project ended up becoming&amp;hellip; something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I started preparing this blog with a straightforward goal: I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing content on the web for a while, I wanted a place for all of it to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was at it, I looked at the different solutions available and realized it could be much more: it could turn into &lt;strong&gt;a minimalistic yet sufficient approach to deliver content online, no strings attached.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, introducing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenbricexyz-a-blog-respecting-your-privacy&#34;&gt;Tokenbrice.xyz, a blog respecting your privacy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this blog as a callout: I&amp;rsquo;m no dev, I can barely code, and yet I was able to respect my reader&amp;rsquo;s privacy, to an unprecedented level in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, TokenBrice.xyz relies on open source frameworks and solutions such as Hugo (rendering of the blog) or Matomo (privacy-conscious analytics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested, this blog implements full IP anonymisation, cookies non-propagation, in full compliance with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/Configuration_piwik.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CNIL guidelines&lt;/a&gt; - an independent French&amp;rsquo; administrative body acting as a privacy watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokenbrice.xyz is deployed on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ipfs.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely happy with the infrastructure just yet, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s significant progress compared to most existing websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-compromise-when-asking-for-more-privacy-conscious-solutions&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t compromise when asking for more privacy-conscious solutions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing will be done, ever, even in the DeFi industry, unless us users make our concerns heard. &lt;strong&gt;So, check your favourite projects&amp;rsquo; websites - and let them know how dirty they&amp;rsquo;ve been!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use tools such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://privacybadger.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; to see how many trackers they have &amp;amp; block them!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A basic CoinTelegraph page has 14 trackers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, please, assume best intentions: trackers and other privacy-intrusive devices are embedded in many systems, sometimes insidiously.  Do not assume a malicious intent as soon as you see a tracker. This tracker can be here for other reasons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of knowledge (I know nothing and made it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of care for your privacy (probably)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of resources (so to them, privacy is not a priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s spell it out in case it&amp;rsquo;s not clear enough: there are no valid reasons for someone to ship a privacy-intrusive website nowadays especially if the site is &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo;, like this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are still too many out there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;let&amp;rsquo;s call these potentially — ignorant, if not — careless, if not — lazy, if not — not-giving-a-fuck-about-privacy developers out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can barely touch an HTML file, and I did it — &lt;strong&gt;so if you truly care, quit your bullshit and get to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ♥ love,&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/how-defi-can-pay-for-your-lunches/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This tactic was first published in the Bankless newsletter and written with advice and support from Ryan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-defi-can-pay-for-your-lunches&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link to the original publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Crypto Natives,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that guy &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/01/07/this-man-has-been-living-on-bitcoin-for-3-years/#3c9a747a2697&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;who tried to live on Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in 2013?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living bankless was harder back then. No one accepted it. Lots of friction. But people kept saying that one day every Starbucks would accept Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny because the guy in that story is now &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fortune.com/2019/12/11/crypto-crown-prince-olaf-carlson-wee/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a mega-millionaire&lt;/a&gt; much the result of…not spending his Bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that teach us? It teaches to not to spend our BTC &amp;amp; ETH! Who wants to end up like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bitcoin pizza guy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s time to check in again. New tools like stablecoins and DeFi protocols are now make going bankless easier…and even…better than a bank?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TokenBrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brice&lt;/a&gt; to share his story. He’s uses an Ethereum address, a few protocols, and a wallet + visa card combo to get passive DeFi income to pay for his lunches.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;watch Brice pay for French cheese&lt;/a&gt; the bankless way)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he plans to do a whole lot more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re closer than ever to the dream of a crypto money system yet hardy anyone’s talking about it. They will. The next 10 yrs is where crypto becomes useful in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the decade we go bankless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brice tells us his system for earning daily DAI to pay for expenses like lunch. He uses an Ethereum address as his bank, DAI as his stablecoin &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-get-a-dai-saving-account&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;tokenized real-estate&lt;/a&gt; to generate passive income, and a smart-contract wallet plus &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Visa card&lt;/a&gt; for spending. Learn about his 5 DAI per day portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal: &lt;em&gt;Generate a stable return in DAI to cover for living expenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill: &lt;em&gt;Intermediate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effort: &lt;em&gt;An hour or two a week, sometimes less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROI: &lt;em&gt;9-12% annual if fully passive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;⚠️&lt;strong&gt;RSA’s note on risk&lt;/strong&gt;: In this bankless frontier Brice is taking on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-assess-the-risk-of-lending&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many risks&lt;/a&gt;—to name a few: failure of DAI, failure of protocols like aDAI, failure of smart-contract wallet, variable interest rates, failure of the entire Ethereum protocol. He could lose all or a portion of his funds in a worse case. The passive income opportunities he mentions should be adjusted for these risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; DeFiFrance Co-Organizer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with money has always been ambiguous. As a teen, I was your usual &amp;ldquo;get money it’s spent that day&amp;rdquo; kind of guy—I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really thinking or strategic about it, just looking forward to enjoying what money enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-masterplan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The masterplan&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I grew up and started earning money on my own, I began thinking more and more about money and personal finance. Shortly after my first proper job, I was already doing math on my expenses, my income, and how long I would need to work and save in order to not have to work anymore. The dream of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, this turned into a basic plan with two arbitrary choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would aim to acquire $1.5M. I assumed this capital would earn 5% / year landing me around $75K/year of interest before taxes—enough to sustain my lifestyle if not too excessive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I’d get there by the time I&amp;rsquo;m 35 (giving 20-30 good years to do my things)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was obviously and predictably a failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Between the start of my plan at 21 years old and now (I’m 28), I was barely able to save a fraction of the required amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-did-my-plan-fail&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did my plan fail?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was learning about decentralised finance, I took some time to reflect on the back-then current failure of my masterplan. Here are the main reasons I identified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I did not define steps to reach the end goal&lt;/strong&gt;: I wanted to jump straight from no passive income to full passive income, without planing any intermediary step to make it more realistic and achievable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had little to no discipline&lt;/strong&gt; when it came to taming my expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I overlooked the &amp;ldquo;details&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. I had little to no idea of how I was actually going to produce a stable and consistent 5% return on such capital. I just assumed it would be attainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-decentralised-finance&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter decentralised finance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s jump to the current situation! I followed the development of the DeFi ecosystem very closely, thanks to my job at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DeFi-France/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;different meetups&lt;/a&gt; I co-organise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I used DeFi out of curiosity: the amount I engaged was marginal—most of my net worth was still in ETH/ERC-20 tokens. Like most, I was both curious and perplexed—is this magic internet money experiment really working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-aha-moment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My &amp;ldquo;Aha!&amp;rdquo; moment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started seriously using more DeFi services, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://compound.finance/markets&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; bZx and then later the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://oasis.app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dai Saving Rate&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;. It was awesome and magical, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t what lit the spark for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic spark came from a piece a tokenised real estate I bought on Ethereum using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://realt.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;RealT&lt;/a&gt;. You may already know RealT—it’s a platform for tokenized real-estate. You own property tokens and receive &lt;strong&gt;daily rental payments in DAI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this? It got my mind racing. This was how it went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st day of rent:&lt;/strong&gt; oh okay, this thing is real. &lt;em&gt;By this point, I started discussing RealT with other people in the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of first week:&lt;/strong&gt; now I was checking my wallet balance every morning—seeing the list of rent paid was exhilarating but left me craving more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of first month:&lt;/strong&gt; at first I spent the DAI almost immediately using my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monolith Visa card&lt;/a&gt;. It was so tempting—the DAI sitting there in my wallet, accumulating every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After first month:&lt;/strong&gt; as the idea of daily DAI became a reality to me, I started rethinking about my masterplan: how much DAI do I need per day to live solely on that? How much capital would it represent? (&lt;em&gt;Hint: way less than $1.5M)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Above: a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1223641685898465282?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DeFi Milkshake&lt;/a&gt; I bought with my daily DAI passive income using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Visa card&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dai-per-day-as-a-framework&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAI per day as a framework&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened there? Why would RealT have this impact on me while Compound did not? (Huge respect for all the projects mentioned in this post, please keep going!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is more straightforward than what people expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to download movies or buy them to watch them. At some point, Netflix offered us streaming and 99% of us never looked back—&lt;strong&gt;I expect the same thing to happen with money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;money-that-empowers-people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money that empowers people&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, daily DAI streaming is a paradigm shift that enables most of us to instantly become much smarter and efficient in the way we relate and manage our assets. It’s empowering to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? The concept of DAI per day reinforces two powerful ideas: first, streaming money and second, using DAI as the base monetary reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is streaming money a paradigm shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes it easy to break down significant objectives in small chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no wait time between the first initial investment and the first payout. Payouts are available instantly—and spendable anywhere that &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monolith.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;accepts Visa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is DAI a paradigm shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAI is a stablecoin—you don’t have to hoard it or worry about daily value lose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAI is at a bridge: easy to spend in the real world but also a hop away from all other Ethereum-based assets (including passive income assets like RealT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As DeFi grows sources of DAI/day are becoming more numerous and attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the tokens used for payouts are more diverse (consider liquidity pools). Bringing everything back in DAI/day gives you exhaustive visibility over all your crypto-passive income sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-daily-dai-lifestyle&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That Daily Dai Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough context, let&amp;rsquo;s get practical: what can we do today with these shiny new financial levers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to my masterplan to give it a second try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, instead of going straight for full financial independence, I decided to aim for something more practical. For me, it was straightforward: I have three lunches in London every week, costing me around $30 per week on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means I need roughly &lt;strong&gt;4.3 DAI per day&lt;/strong&gt; to pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could also skip lunch, but I decided to have it for free thanks to DeFi!&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not there yet but getting close: according to my revised plan, I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting free lunches by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-with-a-5-dai-per-day-portfolio&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting with a 5 DAI per day portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently exploring different possibilities in my portfolio, so let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple one: one that nets you 5 DAI per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can expect if you want a simple passive DAI strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8-9% APR with DAI: for instance, locking your &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-get-a-dai-saving-account&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DAI in the DSR&lt;/a&gt; is at 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9-12.5% APR with income assets: but with a higher risk, using RealT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s if you want to set it and forget about it. There are other opportunities with additional earning opportunities. For instance, if you own a RealT asset, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to sell at a premium on Uniswap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits from their liquidity incentive program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s keep this simple and passive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll stick with the Dai Saving Rate—the safest way to produce DAI interests right now—and RealT—a more risky bet that can offer higher returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much in assets values is required for 5 Daily DAI at the below rates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;
![earning-table](/img/2020/bankless-defi-lunches/earning-table.png)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;going-farther&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going farther&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a simple framework to get started it suffers from some limits. For instance, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to generate 100 DAI/day from this approach, RealT will not cut it. You&amp;rsquo;ll run into issues of liquidity (not enough estate available) or systemic risk (you&amp;rsquo;d be owning a sizeable share of ALL RealT estates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my current understanding, I intend to maintain a similar strategy up to roughly 10 DAI/day. My current portfolio also includes aDAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I blast through the 10 DAI/day, this year, that is if the plan stands, I will be diversifying more and more. I think liquidity pools &amp;amp; staking (SNX, for instance) can be a way to go. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar enough with these topics &amp;amp; haven&amp;rsquo;t started committing serious amounts of money to it—so I&amp;rsquo;m not the best one to talk about it right now: maybe in a few months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonder how this looks in practice? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/address/tokenbrice.eth&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;See for yourself at tokenbrice.eth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;
![zerion-preview](/img/2020/bankless-defi-lunches/wallet.png)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Above: see Brice’s DAI earnings &amp;amp; spending in real-time—&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.zerion.io/0x030de46c333dfd602442a103919412a7987d0ac7/lend?utm_campaign=aw&amp;amp;utm_medium=header_button&amp;amp;utm_source=landing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;plug tokenbrice.eth into Zerion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-on-projections&#34;&gt;** On projections…**
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to loop back to my masterplan. While the DAI per day approach is fantastic it has one main downside: it makes yearly projections harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute now and try to guess how much daily DAI you need to produce 50k DAI per year? Did you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How close were you to 137, the actual answer? Most people tend to overestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while DAI/day is my base, I also look at two other levels to not lose track of the big picture: the DAI per month and the DAI per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you found value in this tactic—my goal is practical DeFi: demonstrating what you can do harnessing DeFi today. This post was written down &amp;amp; translated adaptation of my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DeFi-France/events/268374027/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;last talk at DeFi France.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://slideslive.com/38920018/living-on-defi-how-i-survive-argentinas-50-inflation&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mariano Conti’s talk&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bankless.substack.com/p/straddling-two-worlds-crypto-and&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;electro-shock to the crypto world&lt;/a&gt;: he reminded us that DeFi is already used for very real situations, such as avoiding losing 50% of your net worth to inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the perfect demonstration of someone living in the real world using the opportunities offered by DeFi. My goal was to provide the European version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariano survived inflation using DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, on the opposite, want to live my best life, thanks to DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the magic: &lt;strong&gt;both of us are acting in our own best interest and in doing so, we are supporting the development of a fairer &amp;amp; more accessible financial system for all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clear illustration of how fast the industry is evolving: hop on &amp;amp; enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free coffees ☕, thanks to DeFi</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/free-coffees-thanks-to-defi/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 14:53:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/free-coffees-thanks-to-defi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2020/freecoffees/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Free coffees ☕, thanks to DeFi" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overview of the passive income-earning opportunities enabled by decentralised finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it feels like the world of money is upside down: while the returns offered by banks keep getting lower (if not negative!), innovative techs enabled the emergence of an alternative financial system that is already delivering incredible value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it short: Ethereum created money on steroids while regular finance simply fails at delivering anything else than surface-level innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the money you have sitting at the bank has barely seen a one-digit interest rate for years, the yearly return enabled by decentralised finance frequently prints 2 digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this situation even be real? It seems like decentralised finance (DeFi) is still a little too intimidating for outsiders. Or more like used to! After reading this, you’ll have no excuse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t want you scratching your head at the fifth line, so let’s clear the air on DeFi before we go on. Decentralised Finance is a term used to refer to the nascent &amp;amp; novel new financial ecosystem, built on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this parallel finance ecosystem, thousands of users from around the globe borrow, lend and exchange tokens with one another. They do so using uncensorable and unstoppable services, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://uniswap.exchange/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;free-coffees-thanks-to-strangers-from-theinternet&#34;&gt;Free coffees, thanks to strangers from the Internet
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fully harnessing the capabilities of Ethereum, those new financial services are able to (potentially) operate in a decentralised, trustless and transparent manner — making the system &lt;strong&gt;more accessible and inclusive&lt;/strong&gt; overall (no credit check!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of DeFi is its composability, often referred as “money lego”: projects built using Ethereum’s DeFi follow standards (such as ERC-20 for basic token definitions) enabling “permission-less interoperability” — it’s possible to integrate any project one with the other, without even requiring the help of its creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about the topic, you’ll find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/defifrance/DeFi-Onboarding-Guide-a0713cfe5d844ff28bc829006625b118&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;an exhaustive DeFi onboarding guide&lt;/a&gt; here that introduces many articles, podcasts and videos to learn more about DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know DeFi can be a lot, so I develop a very practical approach to it: &lt;strong&gt;we’ll talk only about LIVE, working services&lt;/strong&gt; that have been paying interests to their users for several months at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;earning-returns-on-a-stablecoin&#34;&gt;Earning returns on a stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ A stablecoin (such as DAI) is a token with stable value. It&amp;rsquo;s usually achieved by tracking the value of a stable asset, like the dollar: 1 DAI = $1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralised finance ecosystem is structuring itself as a more credible alternative every day. Strong &amp;amp; resilient services emerged as basic tools used by most:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://makerdao.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt;: Borrow against ETH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://makerdao.com/da/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DAI&lt;/a&gt;: Avoid price volatility &amp;amp; earn interest (Dai Saving Rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://uniswap.exchange/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap&lt;/a&gt;: tokens exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://compound.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compound Finance&lt;/a&gt;: borrow or lend &amp;amp; earn interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other services exist to produce a passive income thanks to Ethereum, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://realt.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;RealT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aave&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fulcrum.trade/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;bZx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of these new services, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your assets in $ — &lt;strong&gt;DAI is a cryptocurrency tracking the price of $1&lt;/strong&gt; — so that you’re &lt;strong&gt;not exposed to the markets’ volatility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a &lt;strong&gt;5–8% yearly return&lt;/strong&gt;, on that $: your DAI will either be lent or locked directly in the Maker system (Dai Saving Rate) to help stabilize the price of DAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-a-wallet-earning-5-daiday-looklike&#34;&gt;How does a wallet earning 5 DAI/day look like?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple here, we’re considering only 3 investments strategy matching different risk profiles, using only two different services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2020/freecoffees/5DAI.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Dai Saving Rate is arguably the safest way to earn a return on your DAI&lt;/strong&gt;. The risk is minimal because you’re not lending your money to anyone. To keep it short, you lock your DAI in the Maker system, and the system pays you a premium because you’re helping DAI to maintain its peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;🖊 Edit: Please note that the earning rates presented for specific protocols are no longer accurate. However, similar results can still be achieved with alternative methods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;👆&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://defiscore.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the other solution used, RealT, is a &lt;strong&gt;little more novel and risky&lt;/strong&gt;. RealT tokenises real estate on Ethereum &amp;amp; allow anyone to become an owner. If you own a share of RealT estate, you’ll receive &lt;strong&gt;your share of the rent, paid in DAI, daily&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ Since RealT tokens are securities, you will have to through a KYC to purchase them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the level of risk is higher with RealT than Maker, RealT does have one advantage — so far, the returns are stable. On the other hand, Maker’s DSR rate is still changing quite often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;➡ &lt;em&gt;(3 Jan)&lt;/em&gt; 4 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;➡ &lt;em&gt;(8 Jan)&lt;/em&gt; 6 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;➡ &lt;em&gt;(26 Jan 2020)&lt;/em&gt; 7.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;➡ &lt;em&gt;(4 Feb)&lt;/em&gt; 8.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;➡ &lt;em&gt;(9 Feb)&lt;/em&gt; 7.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-dai-tocoffees&#34;&gt;From DAI to coffees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a clearer picture as to how we can generate a passive income using cryptocurrencies, you might wonder: what about the coffees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks to Monolith (disclaimer: I work there) it’s easy as ABC. We provide you with a non-custodial Ethereum wallet, paired with a Visa Debit Card. You can go from DAI in your wallet to a €/£ balance ready to be spent on your card in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was step 1. We’ve shared recently about a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/monolith_web3/status/1223597132952887302?s=20&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;appropriate security model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do not need an account on any exchange to use DeFi.&lt;/strong&gt; It is much safer to access DeFi services directly from your wallet. Using a centralised service generates additional risks for your assets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why is technocentrism killing blockchains?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/why-is-technocentrism-killing-blockchains/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 11:39:41 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/why-is-technocentrism-killing-blockchains/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/technocentrism/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Why is technocentrism killing blockchains?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its very early days, the blockchain industry was a world for geeks. It really made sense at first: I think it was a conjunction of two main factors. First, technical profiles were already deeply involved in promoting the values (autonomy, privacy, trustless cooperation) that blockchains can deliver. Moreover, at the humble beginnings, the roadblocks were technical ones involving “hard science” fields: mathematics, cryptography, game theory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the blockchains developed (Bitcoin is 10 years old!), the people involved did not get any more diverse. &lt;strong&gt;Right now everybody is so focused on the tech that the whole industry has a tunnel vision.&lt;/strong&gt; Go to meet-up and see it for yourself: it’s only tech talk. Every time you go to one, you’re left scratching your head wondering if we even need such a complex solution to a problem you’re not even sure exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;that just like any major government institutions, “the blockchain industry” (if that’s even a thing) is already suffering from groupthink and lack of diversity.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;15-35 years old, tech-focused, guy&lt;/code&gt; description matches 95% of the profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a high-level design perspective, we know it&amp;rsquo;s simply inefficient at best, if not profoundly detrimental: think about the decisions our &lt;code&gt;45-75 years old, male with elite education, rich, white&lt;/code&gt; politicians come up with. Diversity is not just a shiny cool thing to add to show you&amp;rsquo;re progressive: it&amp;rsquo;s actually the &lt;strong&gt;biggest success driver of success for any given group, even before education or expertise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re direly missing outsiders, people who will look at the systems being designed and ask the “naive” yet hard and insightful questions. I intend to demonstrate that to you with two very simple examples — I’ll explain the concepts I’m referring so you won’t need to be a tech lad or a blockchain-expert to follow my though process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proof-of-stakethe-humans-are-rational-beings-assumption&#34;&gt;Proof of Stake — the “humans are rational beings” assumption
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ️ Blockchains need mechanisms for their different participants to reach a consensus. The most famous one is called Proof of Work and involve mining: people dedicating computational power to solve a mathematical challenge in order to verify transactions, and being rewarded for doing so. Proof of Stake (PoS) is another take to solve this problem: instead of the computing power, this time people lock “stakes” (coins of the given currency) in order to validate a transaction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;strong&gt;we’re making with Proof of Stake the very same mistake economics — as an academic field — has been making from day one: assuming that we are all rational beings who behave logically, always trying to maximize our own best interest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, in the case of proof of stake, the whole system holds onto the premise that people don’t want to lose money: so if they start to misbehave (trying to game the system), they will have their “stake” slashed, potentially all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room that is rarely accounted for, as you probably understand already, is that &lt;strong&gt;people are sometimes willing to lose money because they act on other motives&lt;/strong&gt;: love, hate, rage… I can picture dozens of scenarios where a group of people would be willing to burn millions if not billions of dollars just to destroy a chain, but one will be enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s say a PoS protocol becomes increasingly popular, to the point where major banks are worried. Three of them realize that by banding together, and with a little disinformation/scare campaign, they can crash the price 30–40%, and then expand barely a fraction of their annual income to progressively take control of the chain. The coins they buy to destroy the chain are accounted as a cost. They’re not motivated by profit: they are motivated by fear, which is potentially the strongest human driver.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ️ There are ways to protect a chain against such an attack and projects accounting for this, my point is more about the issue of making the assumption that humans are rational while designing this consensus mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;layer-2getting-lost-in-the-tech-losing-sight-of-realusage&#34;&gt;Layer 2 — Getting lost in the tech, losing sight of real usage
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve heard about what we call layer-2 solutions? They are essentially networks built on top of the base network (Bitcoin or Ethereum) to allow faster and fee-less transactions. The most prominent developments include Lightning network, Plasma, Casper and or other state chains. We’ll focus on Bitcoin’s Lightning network as its mains flaws are shared by most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is simple: &lt;strong&gt;some layer 2 solutions somehow managed to provide a worse user experience than the base layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are the restrictions of the Lightning Network, that will never be lifted because they are due to protocol-level decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A channel must be open to receive/send money (aka you must be “online” to send/receive).&lt;br&gt;
 — You don’t have to, on the base layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A channel must be provided with some currency to be opened. &lt;strong&gt;It cannot allow the transit of more currency than what’s in it&lt;/strong&gt;. Say you open a channel with 1 BTC, someone sends you 10 BTC — doesn’t matter, you won’t be able to get more than 1 BTC out of it. &lt;br&gt;
— The base layer knows no limitations to the amounts you can send (as long as you can face the transaction cost) and receive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the transactions are settled off-chain (except the state update — the settlement when you close a channel), which means they are low-fee and fast, but you also lose the security and accountability provided by on-chain settlements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from a very high level perspective, &lt;strong&gt;the layer 2 tradoff is as follows: you loose most (if not all) benefits provided by blockchains + you have to face additional significant limitations but your transactions are faster and cost less.&lt;/strong&gt; Why such a need for speed? An Ethereum transaction currently takes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;~20 second&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where it gets funny: this whole thing has been in development for more than 3 years. So far, there are no real usages or use cases provided by layer-2 solutions that you can’t do better with the appropriate base layer solution. There will never be. Yet we have hundreds of technical papers discussing its potential implementation and crowds getting hyped at the idea of the Lightning Network making small, incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go a meetup talking layer-2 you’ll meet a crowd of semi-enthusiastic nerds discussing the highly technical details of the different implementations. You can ask them my very question: how do you expect this thing to ever be used if the UX is worse than layer 1? They’ll answer you 100% on the technical side, and miss the whole point completely — &lt;strong&gt;breaking through the tunnel vision requires diversity, from within and at an early stage of the development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-leave-blockchains-to-thegeeks&#34;&gt;Don’t leave blockchains to the geeks!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are more than just cool technology. &lt;strong&gt;They are protocols to implement societal-wide change.&lt;/strong&gt; Mass adoption will disrupt the organization of the whole world, so we need people from all backgrounds and perspectives to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;psychologists&lt;/strong&gt; to understand, at the individual level, the current worries people have with blockchains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;sociologists&lt;/strong&gt; to help us figure out how, at the macro-level, we can answer and articulate these concerns to initiate of change of habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;literary profiles&lt;/strong&gt; to help us craft a narrative of change and tell an inclusive and compelling story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;magicians&lt;/strong&gt; to figure out how we can captivate audiences with that story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;artists&lt;/strong&gt; to give a body to the story of the Etherial world — one people can identify and resonate with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;philosophers&lt;/strong&gt; to consider the fundamental consequences of these changes and anticipate their impacts on how we see the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;waiters, taxi drivers, and stewards&lt;/strong&gt; to keep a direct channel with every layer of our society, reminding us of its beautiful diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;social workers&lt;/strong&gt; to help us design systems adapted to the realities of everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;teachers&lt;/strong&gt; to sensitize students as to why privacy, autonomy and decentralization are necessary to be self-sovereign and truly exercise our free will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hell, we even need &lt;strong&gt;public servants&lt;/strong&gt; to understand how to jump from the protocol to the actual real-life implementation, with all its frustrations and the nitty-gritty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the world of tomorrow, let’s make sure it lives by its standards: &lt;strong&gt;the people of tomorrow are diverse and inclusive, so why can’t we be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to give involved in blockchains while not having a technical background? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TokenBrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll do everything I can to help you find your spot because you are a NECESSARY addition. Don’t leave the design of the base protocols of tomorrow to the nerds — they’ll do an awful job at it solely by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;⚠️ My opinions are solely my own — I’m expressing myself outside any professional quality or relationship. And yes, I mostly fit the blockchain mono-profile of a 15–35yo privileged white dude, except for my education not being science-focused, which is yet another proof of my whole point: we need diversity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deep Work: the ultimate state of focus?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/deep-work-the-ultimate-state-of-focus/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/deep-work-the-ultimate-state-of-focus/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Deep Work: the ultimate state of focus?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;, a book published by Cal Newport in 2016 was highly impactful. While Cal’s writing did not bring anything new to the table, it put the spotlight on an idea that was rarely mentioned outside the psychology circles: the “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;” (also known as “being in the zone”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Deep Work Hypothesis:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare, and at the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. … the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2NXMePw&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;p.14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers took a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/focus-and-deep-work-your-secret-weapons-to-becoming-a-10x-developer-8e203a6ad291&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;keen interest for the concept&lt;/a&gt;, yet what Cal Newport suggests &lt;strong&gt;could apply to any profession&lt;/strong&gt;. He explores the idea of “committing to depth”: if you manage to achieve a state of deep concentration while you work, you can achieve phenomenal results &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; take away pride, accomplishment, and satisfaction from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why his ideas gained attention not only from productivity-buffs but also for people who lost touch with the meaning of their jobs and were looking to reclaim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His book touches on other themes related to deep work and its impacts. He addresses the vanity of social media, and the benefits of boredom as well. He also talks about how to **focus **— not a work-related focus but what you decide to focus on as a person — &lt;strong&gt;defines your life and what you make of it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Deep Work — Cal Newport&#34;
	
	
&gt;

    &gt;Deep Work — Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, his book is full of interesting insights. If you find value in this article which overlays its key finding and how to put them into practice, I invite you &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to read the full book.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deliberate-practice&#34;&gt;Deliberate practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach a state of deep focus and concentration, he advocates for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29#Deliberate_practice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;, a concept pioneered by psychologist K.Anders Ericsson. One of his key findings is that the expert’s performance in a given skill has less to do with innate talent and is more likely &lt;strong&gt;tied to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;how the expert deliberately practices being good at it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice%28PsychologicalReview%29.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably heard about Gladwell 10, 000-Hour rule? He considers it to be the key to success in any field. The theory is appealing considering it gives a clear path to expertise: dedicate the time for it! The rule quickly gained traction in popular culture, &lt;strong&gt;despite&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/expert-rule-10000-hours-not-true-2017-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;being debunked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as Ericsson’s research proved, repetition by itself is not enough to become good at a given skill. He lays out the two pillars of deliberate practice, which helps to develop expertise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on a defined perimeter&lt;/strong&gt;: the path to expertise starts by breaking down the skills required to become one. From here, the wannabe-expert can focus on improving those skillsets during his training or day-to-day activities. It works even better when it’s paired with immediate feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous and challenging practice&lt;/strong&gt;: the practice must be frequent (ideally daily) and always challenging. The practice is “deliberate”: the expert practices with the intention of mastering the given skill. This one ties back to grit and perseverance. Focusing on the challenges we struggle with helps us learn faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impacts-on-motivation-andoutcomes&#34;&gt;Impacts on motivation and outcomes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep work, and deliberate practice impact more than merely our state of concentration, the outcome of our work, and the pace at which we achieve it. &lt;strong&gt;Deep states of focus bring more satisfaction from what we do,&lt;/strong&gt; and a sense of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increased satisfaction we pull from our work helps us to stay motivated, making it easy to keep dedicating hours to the practice… Essentially, when deliberate practice is adequately set in motion, it creates &lt;strong&gt;a virtuous circle&lt;/strong&gt; of practice, learning, satisfaction, and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deep-work-inpractice&#34;&gt;Deep work in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the basics on the theory. You can read Cal Newport’ book, or Ericsson’s paper to research it further. Now let’s see how to implement it in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-yourself-for-deepwork&#34;&gt;Setting yourself for deep work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your job and habits, this part can be the easiest as well as the hardest. Basically, to be able to achieve a deep state of concentration you need to set yourself up for success. In practical terms, it means creating a distraction-free work environment. I can&amp;rsquo;t give you the magic formula of focus, but I can share my personal practices; what follows is my focus setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set my phone in airplane mode, out of sight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I close my communication apps (such as Slack, or Thunderbird)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All apps unrelated to my current task are closed. I usually only have my editor (Typora), and Firefox opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I categorically refuse all notifications in my browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have 4–10 tabs maximum opened, all related to my current task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I work in a shared environment, I put my headphones on. It helps me to get in my zone and reduces the physical interruptions from coworkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I put on repetitive electronic music, with little to no lyrics, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lihaERrt2v0&amp;amp;list=PLKgkTIfBISr3qf4hvzmdbwIRd8giXtX0i&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your setup will probably be different, but you can see a pattern here: reducing interruptions and cutting yourself out from the world to enter your bubble of focus and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-it-work-foryou&#34;&gt;Making it work for you
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re all set, it’s time to work and stay focused. You can use different techniques, but there is one particularly useful to get used to working in a highly focused environment: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to understand, and supported by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapier.com/blog/best-pomodoro-apps/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many apps&lt;/a&gt; available on all kinds of environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/pomodoro.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide on the task you will tackle. It must be unambiguous and well defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work for 25 minutes (a pomodoro), undistracted, on this one thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a short 5-minute break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 1–3, up to 4 times and then take a longer break (20 min).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to be able to break up your task in 25 min batches. Some tasks will require several pomodoros, and that’s OK as long as you’re able to break them into smaller consistent tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-goals-into-small-achievable-tasks&#34;&gt;Breaking goals into small, achievable tasks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complex task, such as &lt;code&gt;make a landing page for my project&lt;/code&gt; is not an executable goal. I need to break it down into smaller steps to realize it using the pomodoro technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and analyze landing pages of similar projects, and summarize my main findings. (1–3 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft the content for my landing page (3–4 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft the layout of my landing page (1–2 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a relevant theme/template to use (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the hosting and the theme (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the content on my new landing page (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the template (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polishing and review (1–3 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking your tasks into smaller chunks help you on so many levels. &lt;strong&gt;First, it streamlines the execution. Then it helps to avoid procrastinating.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, it makes it much easier to determine how long with the implementation of the given task takes. I cannot estimate &lt;code&gt;make a landing page,&lt;/code&gt; but once broke down into eight smaller steps I know I&amp;rsquo;ll take me between 10 and 16 pomodoros (~6.5h maximum, excluding breaks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-and-be-willing-tolearn&#34;&gt;Learning, and be willing to learn
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve figured it what your deep work environment looks like, and you’ve got the gist of the pomodoro or other productivity techniques, you’ll be able to work much more efficiently. It also works very well for studying and learning new skills. You can also dedicate some time to read on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how to learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, it comes down to curiosity. Remember the “challenging practice” I mentioned earlier? Attacking new problems and stepping out of what you already know is the best way to grow. You will also need to be, or become a self-learner. It means being able to fix your issues by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that hard if you know how to search answers for any given problems. It takes minutes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bynd.com/news-ideas/google-advanced-search-comprehensive-list-google-search-operators&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to learn about and master Google search operators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/search-operators.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It benefits all kind of profiles, as you will become much more efficient in your online searches. It helps you to avoid asking for help when it’s not necessary. Save your requests for situations where you’ve covered the widely accessible basics and are still without answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-the-depths-ofwork&#34;&gt;Exploring the depths of work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path to focus is hard. You’ll probably need a few weeks to be able to properly chain a few pomodoros together and start to make the focus time longer, up to 50–60 minutes. You’ll see and feel the benefits of these techniques pretty quickly. It will get more comfortable and easier to achieve a state of flow, and you’ll have breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck on your path to productivity and most importantly: don&amp;rsquo;t forget to enjoy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The attention economy: from engagement to dollars</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-attention-economy-from-engagement-to-dollars/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 15:00:20 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-attention-economy-from-engagement-to-dollars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/attention-economy/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The attention economy: from engagement to dollars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention economy is the idea that we’re switching to or already exploring a new economic paradigm where the individuals’ attention is the limiting factor. Goods and content became more accessible and cheaper to produce, but they are now facing a demand wall: attention is a scarce resource — a person has only so much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our mental capabilities are limited and therefore so is the receptiveness of information.&lt;/strong&gt; With the multiplication and the diversification of content (books, videos, blog posts, social media, etc.), we observe a paradigm shift. &lt;strong&gt;The limiting factor switched&lt;/strong&gt;: we’re running out of captivated eyeballs for all the content that gets produced daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/attention-economy/60s.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention became the new scarce limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is very dense, as it recoups pretty much the whole digital marketing industry. We will start with some considerations on attention itself before exploring the impact of the attention economy on the format and content of the media we consume. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the other side of the mirror and see how marketing professionals are addressing this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attention-the-unit-of-the-neweconomy&#34;&gt;Attention, the unit of the new economy?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention is a complex phenomenon. We all have a basic understanding of it when we crave for it or get it. However, we often fail to realize how the attention dynamics drive us in our behavior online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mechanics-of-attention&#34;&gt;The mechanics of attention
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention is &lt;strong&gt;a resource that can lead us to action&lt;/strong&gt;. Once we have it, we can also pass it to someone else, and put her/him under the spotlight. To understand how attention works in our modern world, considering its relationship with money is vital. We tend to think that money can buy attention yet we fail to recognize that this feat cannot be achieved consistently. &lt;strong&gt;Money cannot reliably buy attention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money came with a paradigm of value: with its price units, it made it easy to put a price on everything. &lt;strong&gt;Attention is a wholly different beast. It does not come in precise, indistinguishable units&lt;/strong&gt;. The listeners’ identity matter, and so do their level of attention since there’s no absolute. Therefore, within the attention economy, exchanges are more complex than their streamlined monetary counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just like wealth, attention can build up. Every time you draw attention to you, you somehow build or deplete a stock. If you provide something of interest to your audience, it will grow with each session. With that in mind, we can consider attention like &lt;strong&gt;a kind of enduring wealth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roots-of-the-attention-economy&#34;&gt;The roots of the Attention Economy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public has just recently started to be aware of the attention economy, it’s been theorized a while ago already. To dive deeper into the nature of attention, I recommend to read the transcript of this fascinating conference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Attention Economy and the Net (1997)&lt;/a&gt;. While Michael H. Goldhaber did not coined the term “attention economy,” his conference helps to understand better where it’s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He draws a metaphor of the switch from the monetary economy to the attention economy using the last major transition as a referral point: the end of the feudal period and the transition to the capitalist economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of the feudal period, the pomp and display of the nobility reached a level never before attained; the most gorgeous armor, the most magnificent tournaments of knights, the most elaborate ceremonies between rival nobles, the most brilliant marriages, the greatest interest in noble lineage. But by then it had lost all real function or importance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So today, when the stock market goes up and up, when money wealth itself seems a source of fame more than ever, when being number one on Forbes 400 list seems the height of perfection, when every basketball superstar wants a contract that is at least a million more than the last record one, we seem to be more dazzled by money than ever, just as we seem to be more intrigued by material goods than ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But these interests are superficial and faddish. They are signs of decadence not of a glorious future for the money economy. Even in themselves they speak to the growing desire for attention, the need for it as well. Money is now little more numbers, one number among many, and as a source of lasting attention it can fade in an instant. The attention economy is already here, and more completely so every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-face-of-the-attention-economy-a-brief-history-of-onlinemedia&#34;&gt;The face of the attention economy: a brief history of online media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention economy manifests itself everywhere on the internet nowadays. However, some trends or activity make its realities more palpable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk consider content farms for a minute. Content farms are low-efforts website made to maximize the audience using a different kind of strategies. Filled with ads, their goal is to develop their audience as much as possible to increase their advertising income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the strategy was simple: Google was still somehow easy to game. Publications such as Demand Media amassed a large audience with low-value pieces of content optimized for a specific topic. Back then, the actual time spent on the site after a search was not a profoundly impacting factor of a given website ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Two famous updates to Google&amp;rsquo;s ranking algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2011, Google released an update to its ranking algorithm that impacted content farms: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-panda&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt;. Its goal was to reduce the prominence of content farms in the search results. It penalized websites based on different triggers such as thin, low quality and duplicate content, or the overall space occupied by ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-content-farms-to-clickbaits&#34;&gt;From content farms to clickbaits
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content farms were deeply impacted, as their traffic plummeted. Soon, the activity became unprofitable. However, in the wake of content farms disappearance, the development of social media offered new opportunities for content tricksters. &lt;strong&gt;Content farms imploded, and clickbait and linkbait content quickly took their spot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of gaming Google, these new media were able to &lt;strong&gt;lure millions of people to junk content using social media&lt;/strong&gt;, and particularly Facebook. They used catchy cover images and mastered the art of producing nonsensical yet attractive headlines. The headlines play on emotions to induce a click:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A school girl gave her lunch to a homeless man. What he did next will leave you in tears!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15 hilarious tweets of stupid people that makes you think ‘Do these people even exist?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supermodels apply these three simple tricks to look young. Click to know what they are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashuta Bhattarai provides a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/zerone-magazine/you-wont-believe-how-these-9-shocking-clickbaits-work-number-8-is-a-killer-4cb2ceded8b6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;well-written and highly ironic overview&lt;/a&gt; of the main techniques used to drive clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Listicles&lt;/a&gt; (article listing tops) became a recurrent pattern of low-effort yet high-impact articles. While the exhaustive formula of virality is not solved yet, we have a good idea of the different elements that make it. &lt;strong&gt;Emotions, be them positive or negative play are good drivers of shares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about t&lt;strong&gt;he impacts the attention economy has on the format of the content published&lt;/strong&gt;, you can read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.frankrose.com/the-attention-economy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this fascinating article written by Frank Rose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This affects all form of content: blog posts of course, but even videos and pictures. Allow to dive into one weird, disturbing and yet very telling example to show what the end-results can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-weird-world-of-kidsyoutube&#34;&gt;The weird world of Kids’ Youtube
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content optimized to maximize the attention-grabbing and virality potential are plenty and diverse. So far, we talked about articles, yet as seen in the infographics at the beginning of the article, the volume of video content posted and shared is ever increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

A weird, potentially computer-generated kid video on Youtube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is currently plagued with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;weird kids videos that depict graphical, shocking and stressful content.&lt;/a&gt; Because of the suggestions and the autoplay, kids using YouTube can stumble upon one of such starting their visit from a innocent cartoon video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some YouTubers produce disturbing knock-off videos based on characters kids love, such as Peppa Pig. Then, &lt;strong&gt;they game the algorithm with stuffed titles and descriptions to emerge&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal is ultimately to handle channels with a large following and views so that they can, once again, maximize ads revenues. &lt;strong&gt;Attention drives monetization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;attention-economy-and-gamification&#34;&gt;Attention Economy and Gamification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different forms of incentives are tested to have highly engaged users that frequent check back their feeds**, the biggest one being gamification. It is the import of gaming reward mechanisms on non-game mediums, such as apps**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/dark-patterns-submission-by-design-6f61b04e1c92&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;They fall into Dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, a design trend we discussed in another article. They are used to nudge users to do or accept things they wouldn’t have if the information were presented to them. By adding points, achievements, unique rewards, power-ups and random reward schedule, apps and websites developers can ease the adoption of their service and increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the content we consume gets more and more engaging, we become more demanding&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and less attentive&lt;/strong&gt;. We need stories and compelling content to stay engaged. We crave bite-sized videos and short articles. At the same time, the gamification of apps is becoming a standard. It is now expected, and maybe soon necessary to create apps people understand and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-other-side-of-themirror&#34;&gt;The other side of the mirror
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the marketing world, the attention economy is qualified as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.trendone.com/en/trend-universe/mega-trends/mega-trend-detail/attention-economy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a “mega-trend”&lt;/a&gt;; a shift that manifests itself with many different macro-trends. Since &lt;strong&gt;paying for attention is no longer sufficient not reliable,&lt;/strong&gt; different trends are shaping the future of advertising and digital marketing to acknowledge this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;medium-agnostic-trends&#34;&gt;Medium-agnostic trends
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising as a service:&lt;/strong&gt; the value proposition by itself is not cutting it anymore. To increase their reach, brands aim to convince potential customers with deeds rather than words. This includes surprises, entertainment and unexpected help at the right time — in real and digital places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native Advertising:&lt;/strong&gt; regular advertisements don’t get as many eyeballs as they used to be. To reach a wider audience, the frontiers between media and advertisement are blurred. Native advertisements match the look, feel and function of the media format in which they appear. They are often found in social media feeds or as recommended content on web pages. Deception sells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storytelling:&lt;/strong&gt; brands are telling stories, and making them more compelling than ever. Using data, stories can be fine-tuned to match an audience expectation (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cio.com/article/3207670/big-data/how-netflix-built-a-house-of-cards-with-big-data.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;House of Cards&lt;/a&gt;). Stories are turning into games, and becoming increasingly more personalized and interactive. Some stories are pure myths, like Apple&amp;rsquo;s focus on privacy, yet they are widely spread and believed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;/I know iPhones are sexy, but please look into&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46396/is-it-possible-to-hide-my-devices-udid-from-ios-apps/46398#46398&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Advertising ID policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;if you believe Apple really care about your privacy./&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;expanding-the-marketing-world&#34;&gt;Expanding the marketing world
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influencer Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; audience can be kickstarted by renting someone else’s. The influencer marketing offers quickly diversified and increased over the last years. There are now thousands of influencers and “micro-influencers” (niche specific) ready to place products in their content and co-create with brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proximity Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to a dramatic increase in the precision of location-tracking devices over the last years, a new form of marketing is emerging. Beacons, relying on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi are increasingly used to deliver the messages about local deals to passerby. Apple paved the way establishing the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.beaconstac.com/2018/02/how-to-run-a-powerful-proximity-marketing-campaign-on-ios/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IBeacon&lt;/a&gt; protocol and Samsung quickly followed suit. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.computerworld.com/article/3321932/social-media/google-maps-is-the-new-social-network.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Google Maps is also turning into a social network&lt;/a&gt; / advertising platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensation Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; brands are now able to harness the power of sensations and emotions better than ever before. New forms of advertising are used, such as stunts. Thanks to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;guerilla marketing&lt;/a&gt;, new spaces are also exploited like building facades or streetlights. Finally, with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_branding&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sensory branding&lt;/a&gt;, our senses are being used to promote new messages. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.shopify.com/retail/the-science-of-smell-how-retailers-can-use-scent-marketing-to-make-more-sales&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Scent marketing&lt;/a&gt; is highly effective at modulating our experiences and attract bystanders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For marketers, the attention economy is the underpinning of novel approaches to finding more intrusive and effective forms of advertising and explore new channels&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems like the plethora of content that is causing the attention shortage is not going anywhere and will keep increasing. Where does this leave us with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-problem-with-the-internet-businessmodel&#34;&gt;A problem with the Internet business model?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges of the attention economy lie with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;dominance of the advertising model&lt;/a&gt;. Advertisement is now considered as the only way to offer free services and content at scale. It doesn’t have to be this way. It was a deliberate choice, promoted by a few actors including the GAFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisements show no signs of slow down, and millions of content pieces are published every day. The demographics are simply not there to support this much content. However, marketers and content producers are surprisingly optimistic. Indeed, bots might save us: their eyeballs multiply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dark patterns: submission by design?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/dark-patterns-submission-by-design/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 09:02:04 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/dark-patterns-submission-by-design/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Dark patterns: submission by design?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever scrolled through Facebook for hours despite having other things to do? Or went through a sign up process, clicking “Next”, “Ok”, “Get Started” buttons without reading anything else? Or maybe you’ve been using an app every day for years without knowing anything about its privacy policy? Don’t worry, there is a whole science created to make sure you don’t feel bad or even question this, it bears a name and it’s discussed publicly: dark patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark design practices are very diverse in nature, but they all share a common attribute: &lt;strong&gt;nudging the users to accept, do, or share something they wouldn’t have if the information were presented to them in a non-ambiguous fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s essentially deception and dishonesty by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From deceptive wordings (such as “Don’t opt out” check-boxes) to shiny, colorful buttons opposed to boring legalese grayscale text on white background, the artifices are plenty. They involve an understanding of human psychology, such as harnessing FOMO to pressure us into making an impulsive decision or playing with timing and time pressure (the e-commerce’s beloved “Limited offer”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-kind-ofmagic&#34;&gt;A kind of magic?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magicians use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdirection_%28magic%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt; to draw their audience attention in order to screen from detection certain details for which secrecy is required. They attract the attention to one thing to distract it from another. Dark design patterns are used to achieve the same effect. Except that this time the goal of the trick is not to entertain you, but to harvest your data, manipulate your thinking processes or your votes, make you an app-addict, or just to make you buy things you do not need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magicians face their audience when they perform the deception; they have no trouble sleeping at night. They use their art to enchant. &lt;strong&gt;If they used it to steal, it would no longer be called magic but pickpocketing.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of what allowed dark design patterns to spread is the disconnection with the audience: &lt;strong&gt;such practices are developed by UX designers who don’t have to look at their audience in the eyes&lt;/strong&gt;. They merely see the conversion metrics grow and keep the grin to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-dark-patterntypology&#34;&gt;A dark pattern typology
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are nothing new. The UX designer Harry Brignull coined it eight years ago already and registered the website &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt; to call out the practice as unethical and help users recognize it as such. What’s new is the scale it reached, as we can now find dark patterns used in pretty much every major website or app. Harry Brignull even established a typology of dark patterns, all who are documented by countless examples. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-app-darkpatterns&#34;&gt;In-app dark patterns
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmshaming:&lt;/strong&gt; guilting the user into opting into something. The decline option is usually worded so that the user is shamed into compliance: who wants to click a &lt;code&gt;I am a bad person&lt;/code&gt; action link?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden costs&lt;/strong&gt;: hiding additional costs (such as delivery) until the very last step of the purchase process. By then, the user has committed quite time to the process, and probably already inputted his credit card info. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt; might give him the nudge he needs to finish his purchase despite the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick questions&lt;/strong&gt;: framing questions to mislead the users. While reading quickly, the user might think he’s opting-out while he’s actually opting-in. It works even better when used in series alternating opt-in and opt-out like on the example below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/trick-q.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service-level-darkpatterns&#34;&gt;Service-level dark patterns
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playbook is quite extensive yet not exhaustive; you can check out the other ones &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the software and the apps themselves, dark patterns are found all thorough products and services, from the sign up to the account deletion process. Privacy policies and terms and conditions are the dark patterns magnets. Different methods are used to make them easy to accept, hard if not impossible to truly understand and even harder (if even possible) to refuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy-intrusive options enabled by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscuring the more privacy-friendly settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threats of loss of functionality or deletion of the user account if specific settings are not chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop-ups compelling users to make certain choices, while essential information is omitted or downplayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inability to use the app or register if the privacy policy is refused (“take it or leave it” approach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dark-patterns-beyond-theapps&#34;&gt;Dark patterns, beyond the apps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dark patterns thrived and prospered on the Internet, they’re not bound to the digital world. Many subscriptions service adopt a “signing up is easy, canceling is hard” model. Once again, different tricks are used to make it as hard as possible for the user to unsubscribe, such as the threat of a high cancellation fee or making the unsubscribe process tedious. Some services even force the user to send a letter or call a given number while he registered by filling a form online. Those who work up the courage to call might face absurd business hours or agents that simply hang up on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gym clubs are among the worst when it comes to canceling subscriptions. On boards and forums online, you can find countless stories of people going through the hassle of the cancellation process. This story from a redditor is particularly insightful: it took him &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://np.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/9duble/i_successfully_canceled_an_la_fitness_membership/e5k7o9b/?st=jltqrwml&amp;amp;sh=040d8d01&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;4 hours and 26 phone calls to cancel his gym membership&lt;/a&gt;, and the use of several different phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-did-we-getthere&#34;&gt;How did we get there?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the frustration and even anger they generate, one might wonder how dark patterns can be so prevalent? After all, stories like the one told above are detrimental to the brand. The deceived user will not fail to share his disappointment with his friends and online once he freed himself from the trickery. Well, the short answer is that superficially, dark patterns work. If you A/B test an honest, non-deceptive form versus a dark pattern filled one, the second one will certainly land more conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
A basic form of A/B Testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When only the perimeter of their implementation (sign up form, purchase process…) is considered, dark patterns inevitably land more results than an honest approach. The harmful consequences they can unleash are delayed and at the brand level. They only come later on when people are denouncing their practices online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-whats-the-actual-hidden-cost-of-dark-patterns&#34;&gt;So, what’s the actual hidden cost of dark patterns?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of a simple risk/benefit analysis at the scale of the brand, dark patterns behind widespread are now one of the main contributing factors of massive issues, at a societal level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users are being hooked to apps&lt;/strong&gt;: the dark patterns are engineered to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;encourage users to form addictive habits&lt;/a&gt; to the apps they interact with. These apps use diverse techniques such as abusive notifications (“We haven’t seen you in a while!”), or feeds implementing a variable schedule of rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal data are collected at an unprecedented pace and scale&lt;/strong&gt;, and privacy is getting harder and harder to achieve. Free apps and social network harvest data and share them with a vast network of data brokers who profit from trading people’s personal information. In 2015, data brokering was already a $200 billion industry. This activity is lawful, but the users are mostly unaware of it or its extent thanks to misleading interfaces — this pattern bears the name of Facebook’s founder: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Privacy Zuckering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data collected makes it possible to target ads and communication so precisely that we reach a point where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;free will is put back into question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of dark design and other privacy-intrusive practices are already there, and their effect will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-reclaim-our-digitallives&#34;&gt;How to reclaim our digital lives?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals concerned about privacy are forced to work at well, an individual level so far. They look into the software they use and prefer open-source whenever it’s possible. They double check every piece of hardware they get and quite often have to disable several features (Wifi, Bluetooth…) to not compromise their privacy. To learn more about how to protect your privacy online, you can check the resources from the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, at a societal level the answers are lackluster if not inexistent. The laws are still very lax, and many of the patterns described before are still lawful. There were many talks about GDPR this year, but despite being more restrictive than previous regulations, it has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/policy/data/exemptions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many exemptions&lt;/a&gt; and is overall insufficient to protect individual consumers against privacy-intrusive companies like Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we left with? In situations where privacy is an absolute necessity, some tools are available, yet they have a steep learning curve as they do not share the friendly UX of their privacy-intrusive counterpart. Individuals who are unfamiliar with such solutions have no other option than going analog if they are not willing to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ssd.eff.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;train themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-tech-fight-techsabuses&#34;&gt;Can tech fight tech’s abuses?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the laws won’t suffice to ensure individuals’ protection, some people are looking for solutions to trigger an ethical revolution in the tech space itself. It means that we’ll need not only new tools but a complete overall of the internet business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding privacy and traceability of the data we share, the decentralized ledgers such as blockchain-based systems might provide a credible solution. They offer interesting features to regain control over our digital lives, such as censorship and attack resistance, or fault tolerance. Different projects are emerging to solve the several problems we currently face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical advertising and privacy protection: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable and decentralized identity management: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.civic.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uport.me/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uPort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial privacy: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.getmonero.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such systems are still under development and far from mainstream adoptions. In the meanwhile, the way we design digital interfaces needs to change: can there be such a thing as bright design? We can at least see how it would look like: transparent, honest, and empowering the users instead of deceiving them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Edge of the Static Web</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-edge-of-the-static-web/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-edge-of-the-static-web/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This article is the second of a series which examines the technical reasons behind the renewed interest for static websites, from both a content writer and a developer perspective. It also provides you with useful tools and services to build a static website. If you want to learn more about the macro perspective behind the shift toward the static web, feel free to read:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/&#34; &gt;Static web - back to the roots?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-websites-serve-their-purpose-better&#34;&gt;Static websites serve their purpose better
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s leave the tech aside for a second and take a step back. What&amp;rsquo;s the first goal of a website? Let me gonna risk the &amp;ldquo;to be seen and read&amp;rdquo; answer. So then how can speed and performance be so much overlooked? It&amp;rsquo;s a direct factor in the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider for instance the New York Times, which is far from the worst in terms of development practices. Let&amp;rsquo;s load the same page (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/section/health&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Health Section&lt;/a&gt;) in two different &amp;ldquo;versions&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full one, including all trackers, ads, and unnecessary scripts. Rendered using Chrome, private browsing with no extensions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cleaned one, using Firefox and several extensions to remove most advertisements, tracking and other unnecessary scripts.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tests were realized on my laptop with a connection speed of ~7 Mbps upload/download.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the eloquent results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FULL/BLOATED VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAREBONE/SUFFICIENT VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBSERVED Δ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE WEIGHT (MB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;4.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;79% lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB OF REQUESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;295&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;91.5% lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOAD TIME (S)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;2.07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;60 % lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results we observe are consistent with our experimentations. &lt;strong&gt;Static websites are about 10 times lighter than their dynamic counterpart.&lt;/strong&gt; So how comes dynamic became the standard, especially during the 2005-2015 period where the connection speeds were still limited?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-the-dynamic-heresy&#34;&gt;From the Dynamic Heresy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think about this from today&amp;rsquo;s perspective, the whole thing is absurd - the very existence of WordPress is essentially senseless, considering its primary usage. Instead of looking at the issue from the perspective of static websites being relevant, it&amp;rsquo;s much clearer with the tables shifted: &lt;strong&gt;dynamic websites are unnecessary in 95% of their current usage scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are specific situations where having a dynamic website is a necessity - any case you want to render a user input for instance, like a forum or a board. &lt;strong&gt;However, the default behavior should be to build a static website&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if your content is static (= rarely changed once published, like most websites), why choose a dynamic engine? All your users see the same pages every time. So, using a dynamic engine &lt;strong&gt;means that it forces a computation on both the server and user side every time a page is rendered&lt;/strong&gt;: it is incredibly wasteful and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a static website is built once on deployment and then simply served to all its viewers. It dramatically reduces the resource and network usage both for the server and the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did we get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;rsquo;s a tricky question but &lt;strong&gt;mostly a matter of convenience.&lt;/strong&gt; Back in 2005 and until recently, dynamic websites were all the rage. New frameworks were popping up everywhere, and clients wanted to offer an incredible experience on their website, often at the expense of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when a developer was tasked with building a new website, he would look at the available building blocks and find shiny dynamic rendering engines. Going static back them was almost like reinventing the wheel with each development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-the-static-serenity&#34;&gt;To the Static Serenity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;organic-performance&#34;&gt;Organic Performance
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall speed and resource usage of a website have a tremendous impact on its organic performance. It was true 10 years ago, but it is even more now with the rise of mobile — &lt;strong&gt;poor performance destroys the average time on page, therefore annihilating the CTR&lt;/strong&gt; (Click-Through-Ratio)… That is if the page manages to rank in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in SEO for the last few years, and I already so considerable shifts in the industry. When I started, we could grab the first spot with a well-written and researched content piece on a long-trend keyword, using a bare WordPress and requiring little to no backlinks. Nowadays the competition is intense: every detail counts, and none can be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A website performance is like a K-factor affecting all potential interactions users can have with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms like WordPress emerged to allow people to create websites without having to worry about this. Paradoxically, after years of development, such frameworks are now so bloated that they require an intense and complex optimization process — they are no longer accessible to non-tech profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;most static website generators are able to build websites complying with SEO best practices, out of the box&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes sitemap.xml/robots.txt generation, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, Schema.org (rich previews), taxonomies, href lang/multilingual markup and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we reached the current weird situation where despite WordPress&amp;rsquo; relative simplicity, the most straightforward option to build a blog that will be read is actually to create a static website, even for non-developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-websites---resources-and-services&#34;&gt;Static Websites - Resources and Services
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the data, you might be considering a switch to static? Welcome aboard! The next section introduces resources that will help you build a blazing fast and optimized static website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of Jekyll in 2008, the framework adopted by GitHub, static websites are gaining traction. New frameworks and services have been developed to facilitate the conception of a static website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-websites-engines&#34;&gt;Static Websites Engines
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Logo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Framework&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/jekyll.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Jekyll Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ruby&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Available as a Gem or integrated with GitHub Pages. Jekyll is fast and efficient but offers minimal features out of the box. Many plugins are offering additional functionalities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/gatsby.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Gatsby Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Along with Jekyll, Gatsby is the most popular static website framework. It offers very good performance and a large range of plugin as well as integrations with many third-party services.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/hugo.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hugo Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Go&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hugo puts forward its impressive performance, especially while building large websites. It offers anything you need to build a website compliant with SEO best practices out of the box.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/hexo.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hexo Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hexo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NodeJS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another fast static website generator with a built-in package manager to install plugins and themes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/pelican.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Pelican Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Python&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pelican is another interesting alternative for pythonistas however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as many much third-party resources available (themes, plugins…) as the previous ones.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static websites are also a perfect fit for documentation or e-books. Some frameworks were explicitly developed for the purpose, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gitbook.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitBook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docusaurus.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Docusaurus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/gitbook-screen.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;GitBook Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Preview of a website built with GitBook&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to explore all potential options, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check this excellent, exhaustive database&lt;/a&gt; maintained by netlify (more about them below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-management-system&#34;&gt;Content Management System
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your website is up and running, you might want to implement a content management system so that your editor can easily submit new pieces of content. If you are a developer building a blog for yourself, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need a CMS. However, they are convenient for those who make sites maintained my non-technical profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/forestry-screen.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;forestry CMS&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Preview of the editor interface on Foresty&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-git-repository-the-base-cms&#34;&gt;A Git repository, the base CMS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Github (or Gitlab) repo as your CMS comes with many advantages over a traditional CMS, including among others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User and permission management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branches (staging, pre-prod, prod)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the full files&amp;rsquo; history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can seem intimidating if you have non-technical profiles interacting with your website, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be: &lt;strong&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the Git CLI to push a commit,&lt;/strong&gt; they can do all of it from Github&amp;rsquo;s website. We cover in depths the writing/editing flow of static websites in 🔴 -&amp;gt; StaticWebsite_MKT.md /WN/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alternative-cms&#34;&gt;Alternative CMS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a git repo is too limited for your needs, you can consider one of the following alternatives. They are all built on top of a repo, so using a git repo as CMS should be your first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Logo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/netlify.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Netlify Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.netlifycms.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Netlify CMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A CMS built for static website generator able to integrate with the most common frameworks. Netlify is a pretty exhaustive suite of services for static websites including tools for CD/CI, user management (CMS), forms and images management.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

    &gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A compelling alternative to Netlify that focuses on the UX of the editor. Forestry is a great choice if you are looking for a visual CMS to facilitate the contributions of non-tech profiles to a static website. Forestry also includes other tools, as Netlify does.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

    &gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a third alternative that focuses on simplicity. Vapid is a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; CMS, made &amp;ldquo;for people who build websites for other people&amp;rdquo;. Vapid is easy to customize and maintain, as it only uses HTML tags to function.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-integration--deployment&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration &amp;amp; Deployment

    &gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and Forestry offer a continuous deployment service integrated with their CMS. They are usually the two most suitable options if you are building a website that will be maintained by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are simply looking for a CI/CD solution and don&amp;rsquo;t need the CMS you can either use Netlify without its CMS component or consider the usual CI/CDs services that all offer resources facilitating the support for static websites:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static web - back to the roots?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This article goes back to the early years of the web to understand why dynamic websites are so prevalent today. Then, we consider what static websites bring in terms of performance, editing speed, and organic results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the web was static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early days Internet was a place for tinkerers. Despite the frequent comparisons between MySpace and Facebook, the two services are fundamentally different. They are also a &lt;strong&gt;good representation of the &amp;ldquo;Internet Paradigm&amp;rdquo; of their respective time of fame&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are social networks, yet creating a page on MySpace required a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. The service was launched in 2003 after all. On the other hand, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s easy to use interface contributed to its success and helped it reach 2+ billion users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the MySpace/Facebook antagonism lies on the most critical point of tension on the internet - &lt;strong&gt;how to interact with the content we edit?&lt;/strong&gt; There are mostly two ways to look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)&lt;/strong&gt; — As the name suggests, in this paradigm the goal is to have an editor as close as the final rendering. WordPress was one of the most visible early proponent of WYSIWYG, but others joined. The Medium editor (featured below), built using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;, is now regarded as one of the best WYSIWYG experience available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency First&lt;/strong&gt; — WYSIWYG editors are easy to get started with but tend to be either clunky or limited. Ultimately, introducing some form of syntax adds complexity, but it also allows more control over the final rendering of the content. Moreover, since the formatting is enforced with syntax (HTML, CSS, Markdown…), it&amp;rsquo;s no longer dependent on the editor used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/mediumeditor.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Medium Editor&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dawn-of-wordpress&#34;&gt;The Dawn of WordPress
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WordPress quickly took over the web: it currently holds about 60% of the CMS market share. WordPress is so commonplace that we can even look at it from a venture point encompassing the whole web: &lt;strong&gt;about a third of all websites use WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success does not mean relevance. Indeed, power users are leaving WordPress in drove for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing&lt;/strong&gt;: The WP Editor, even the new Guttenberg, is a pain. It&amp;rsquo;s slow, clunky, and comes with a convoluted block logic. Using it to format and edit content results in a pure waste of time considering the alternative options. Besides, it does not support any &amp;ldquo;smart feature&amp;rdquo; by default such as footnotes or tables of content. They require an absurdly complex workflow or yet another plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of its success, WordPress is a prime target for hackers. Any large WP-based website will have to implement additional measures (plugins?) to handle different types of attacks. Moreover, WordPress supports all version of PHP ranging from 5.2.4 (released 12 years ago) to 7.2. Cross this with all the potential plugins and themes, and you get an endless list of attack vectors. Here is an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kinsta.com/blog/is-wordpress-secure/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;overview of the most common ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Out of the box, WordPress performance is atrocious. With some plugins (cache, CDN…) and other settings you can speed it up - but is it your job? &lt;strong&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t the point of a web framework to minimize the optimization effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugin Bloat&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of all the plugins WordPress requires, it ends up slowing down the website and hindering security. &lt;strong&gt;A fresh WP install needs 5-10 plugins to be usable and 10-15 to be &amp;ldquo;optimized&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-it-static&#34;&gt;Make It Static!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when WordPress was released in 2003, the competition was unconvincing. However, this was 15 years ago. In the meanwhile, we saw exciting &lt;strong&gt;tools and frameworks emerge both to format written content and to host and render it for the end-user.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s the development of both, hand in hand, that paved the way for the static web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with editing, focusing on Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rise-of-markdown&#34;&gt;The Rise of Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While WordPress was getting fatter and fatter, alternatives developed both to host website and format content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the content, new lightweight markup languages like Markdown offer a credible alternative even for a non-technical profile. Markdown&amp;rsquo;s promise is simple: take an hour to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;master the cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; to cut down formatting time to virtually 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Markdown is reasonably straightforward, quick to master yet incredibly potent. A writer using a markdown editor and some shortcuts can write and format its content at the same time. On top of that, Markdown offers many exporting options (HTML, PDF, LaTex, Doc…) and ensures that your formatting stays consistent whatever the end format is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it might seem, but it&amp;rsquo;s not given: with markdown you can handle text-related features (footnotes, tagging, linking to a section, table of contents, diagrams and charts) at the document-level instead of having to interact with yet another layer. &lt;strong&gt;It dramatically improves the maintainability and portability of your content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/jamstack.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;JAMStack&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-control-is-not-just-about-code-writers-love-it-too&#34;&gt;Version control is not just about code: writers love it too!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version control and git-based development rapidly developed in the software world for solid reasons. It makes the whole development process more reliable and safe. Furthermore, the user permission management system, the branch logic and the access to the full file history as well as the ability to compare files between to versions are incredibly useful to avoid breaking changes or fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the developers got all these fancy new tools, us writers were still editing our articles in Word to copy paste it in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor and then start our formatting struggle. Why not share the goodies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as paradoxical as it can seem, a Github repo makes for a very compelling CMS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy User/Access Management&lt;/strong&gt;. The branch logic fits the editing process. For instance, if there is a need to keep a tight grip over the content published, the merging power on the master branch can be granted only to the chief editor to ensure consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branch Logic&lt;/strong&gt;: while using a repo as a CMS, branches can serve various purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to use one branch as a staging environment so that the writers can see the final rendering of their content on their machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File History&lt;/strong&gt;: with GitHub repos, you can access the whole history of a file and easily compare two versions. It is handy, especially if your blog has a lot of different contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No setup&lt;/strong&gt;: the repository can be opened in a click. From here, another click with a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/deploy-button/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; is enough to have a blog up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-the-lack-of-performance-lies-exclusion&#34;&gt;Beyond the lack of performance lies exclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we stayed very pragmatic as we addressed static websites&amp;rsquo; benefits in terms of performance or increased efficiency. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and consider the big picture for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average website size is now well over 3 MB&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (as 2017). &lt;strong&gt;More the size itself, the macro-level issue lies in the trend&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is the evolution of the average website page since 2011 for reference&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/pagebloat.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Web performance page bloat&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a reference for comparison on blog.call.tech, our homepage weights 10 KB and an average page (image included) weights about 400 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I need to download a full and bloated 3+ MB page to get simple textual information that might be just a few bits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are sitting here, probably on a modern laptop/smartphone with a decent connection. What about those who live in countries where the Internet service is poor? Most of the Internet is made of text; it should be lightweight. Why do I need to download a full and bloated 3+ MB page to get simple textual information that might be just a few bits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mind-the-people-using-your-websites&#34;&gt;Mind the people using your websites
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a first world problem; in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s a terrible third world problem. &lt;strong&gt;Poorly designed websites result in the exclusion of regular people from services they could benefit from.&lt;/strong&gt; Moreover, the unnecessary data usage bloats the network creating congestions, higher demands and eventually pushing the price of the service up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go as far as stating this: &lt;strong&gt;publishing an unnecessary dynamic website in 2019 is an abuse of a common good.&lt;/strong&gt; The Internet network is a shared resource, why don&amp;rsquo;t we try to avoid another tragedy of the commons using nothing more than common sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;slow-websites-are-lonely&#34;&gt;Slow websites are lonely
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let us merely ask a question to those who design those websites 12-times more massive than they should be: why so much hate? In perfect conditions, &lt;strong&gt;the average Internet user with his 7.2 MB/s average connection will need more than 3 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact? Neil Patel, a well-known figure in the SEO community, produced a very comprehensive info-graphics covering this topic.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He estimates that &lt;strong&gt;40% (53% on mobile) of users abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.&lt;/strong&gt; So crossing the two numbers, you get the following absurdity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News, media and other sites are loosing up to 40% of their potential traffic because of their poor performance stemming from their baseless choice of a dynamic rendering engine. This figure does not include the organic traffic lost because of a lack of SEO-compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s skim the fat. Do we need this many scripts? How could having a dynamic engine continuously regenerating the same static content have become the standard of the Internet? Is this really this hard to implement proper handling of images (resizing, compression, load order) in 2019?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could having a dynamic engine continuously regenerating the same static content have become the standard of the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started-with-the-static-web&#34;&gt;Getting started with the static web
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are convinced that static websites will become commonplace shortly. In the meantime, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to beat a bloated dynamic website at the SEO-game using a static one: now it the time to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo was a fit for our tech blog as it helped us streamline the content editing process while achieving impressive organic results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the offer of static website generators and other related services greatly expanded since the release of Jekyll in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/blockchains-meet-telecommunications-opportunity-risk-or-a-necessity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/blockchain-telco/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Blockchains meet Telecommunications: Opportunity, Risk, or A Necessity?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the telecom industry benefit from blockchains and decentralized ledger technologies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies are set to revolutionize many industries. While the technical component themselves are nothing new, the blockchain mixes them up in a previously unexplored layout that enables &lt;strong&gt;many new use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, blockchains are a new kind of live and self-updating databases exploring new models of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into blockchains applied to the telco industry, let’s address some of the most critical dimensions of blockchains. We’ll then be able to consider the potential &lt;strong&gt;use cases blockchains enable for the telecommunication industry&lt;/strong&gt; with live examples of existing projects whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-3-minutes-intro-to-blockchains&#34;&gt;A 3 minutes intro to blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-blockchains&#34;&gt;What are blockchains?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains (and others distributed ledger technologies known as DLT) allow nurturing different relationships between service/data providers and their users. The main innovation carried by blockchains lie in their &lt;strong&gt;distributed nature&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through game-theory mechanics and cryptographic seals, blockchains offer a credible solution to the challenge of &lt;strong&gt;maintaining a database without having a central authority&lt;/strong&gt; (such as an institution) warranting its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a &lt;strong&gt;network of peers&lt;/strong&gt; review the transactions and the ones that are validated are added to the chain. Checking mechanisms can vary depending on the needs and use cases solved by the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining is the most well known of such mechanism, and currently used by the most prominent project such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blockchains are irreversible. Once a change is validated and reviewed by the peers maintaining the network, it cannot be altered. Each new “blocks” added after makes it even less likely to be modified. Each transaction added to the chain is &lt;strong&gt;time-stamped&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cryptographically sealed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all transactions are public and &lt;strong&gt;auditable&lt;/strong&gt; — anyone can check at any time which block is validated, when, by whom, and what transactions it contains (emitting address, receiving address and amount transferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the peer-validation mechanism, the cryptographic seal, and the transparency offered by the blockchain’s publicity makes them &lt;strong&gt;“trustless”&lt;/strong&gt;: their users don’t need to trust a central body to proceed the transaction, as it doesn’t exist. Besides, since the book is public, anybody can verify that there is no foul play.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Potential benefits of blockchain (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=10f56b96-b249-4621-949c-f25514fc127a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-blockchains-have-tooffer&#34;&gt;What do blockchains have to offer?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockchain was initially developed to offer an alternative to centralized monetary systems, with projects such as Bitcoin or Litecoin which got a lot of press. However, the &lt;strong&gt;decentralized, transparent and auditable ledgers&lt;/strong&gt; offered by blockchains-based system allow for many innovative use cases in diverse industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;the missing technological block enabling the switch&lt;/strong&gt; between systems with several levels of intermediation, each level requiring trust and creating a potential for abuses and manipulations to more direct and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By autonomous, we’re not picturing the artificial intelligence-fueled self-deciding robot fantasy but quite the opposite: peer-driven systems with enough checks and balances built-in so that they won’t require external forces (such as laws) to maintain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain-based technologies are still at a very &lt;strong&gt;early stage of development&lt;/strong&gt; and not yet able to achieve this vision. However, they are not to dismiss altogether until further advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limitations of our current AI systems, we’ve found many use-cases them for them. They still fail dramatically at complex task involving several interlaced processes, but perform quite well with a very narrow and well-defined scope: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40042581&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;beating the world’s Go champion,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.asmag.com/showpost/24046.aspx&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;traffic monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;trivia games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its early stage, blockchains-based systems are bound for similar implementations. They will &lt;strong&gt;take over well-defined scope&lt;/strong&gt; within industries, starting with positions where there is a significant need for traceability and transparency and the current share taken by intermediaries is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-in-practice-usecases&#34;&gt;Blockchains in practice: use cases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust is the cornerstone of the business. Blockchains enable &lt;strong&gt;trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution&lt;/strong&gt;. It will streamline relationships between partners and reduce frictions between the various stakeholders involved in a given system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralized dimension of blockchain-based systems, if maintained, could foster a new kind of trust that is no longer based on the reputations of the actor but instead rely on the &lt;strong&gt;credibility gathered by the systems themselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-are-blockchains-goodfor&#34;&gt;So, what are blockchains good for?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could ease and empower identity verification processes, allowing users to control easily and precisely which data piece is shared, when and with whom. &lt;br&gt;
It could also facilitate cross-industries interconnections between different systems, reduce abuses both on the user-side (identity-theft) and on the businesses sides (fraud).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment processing&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain-based systems can power payment networks with novel and exciting characteristics. Transactions can be validated in a near instantaneous fashion (&amp;lt;10s) while processing fees are so low than micro-transactions can be considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could finally fulfill the promise of a subscription as easy as it to terminate it. Standards are currently drafted (such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/948&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ERC-948&lt;/a&gt;) to allow services providers to offer subscriptions that would be blockchain-based. &lt;br&gt;
Such subscriptions would be easy to manage from the user side. They also provide a predictable revenue stream to the service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data tracking and validation&lt;/strong&gt;: thanks to blockchain the cryptographic seal and data verification process, it could help to facilitate the validation of data, be it from sensors or other devices. The verification mechanisms can guarantee the data is coming from an authenticated and well-functioning device. &lt;br&gt;
This will prevent detrimental decisions based on corrupted data. The data will be time-stamped and easily auditable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/strong&gt;: the IoT requires sound authentication and data sharing processes to develop. Just like the identity management use case, blockchain could facilitate and provide a backbone for the authentication of machines and their data exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These five high-level use cases for blockchains can unfold in many different industries, triggering new developments are a power redistribution. For the rest of the article, we’ll limit ourselves to the telco industry and consider the main activities that could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-use-cases-for-the-telcoindustry&#34;&gt;Blockchains use cases for the telco industry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications of blockchains based technologies presented in the previous sections to the telecom industry are plenty. Some are quite obvious, as they provide an alternative to already existing solutions. Others require more abstraction to be considered since they involved several use cases nested with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;devices-identification&#34;&gt;Devices Identification
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of SIM cards currently permits the identification of devices on cellular networks. While the technology has its merits (especially cost-efficiency), it might not be the most adapted for 5G and device-to-device networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;public-key cryptography&lt;/a&gt; logic, implemented in blockchain systems might offer a credible alternative to solve the challenges posed by the &lt;strong&gt;dynamic authentication of potentially billions of (autonomous) devices&lt;/strong&gt; on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication on existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin relies on &lt;strong&gt;a pair of keys&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public key is the public ID of the recipient&lt;/strong&gt;. For bitcoin, it is used to receive payment. It works like an email address: anybody that knows it can send money to it, but only the owner of the related private key can generate a transaction from this address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The private key is used to verify ownership of the address.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing with the email comparison, the private key would be the password of the email address. It is required to send emails (initiate transactions) from that address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to eSIM, embedded SIM card, a virtual SIM standard, is already happening: the latest generation of Apple devices are supporting the standard. Since the SIM card is no longer physical, strong security standards are necessary to prevent abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a blockchain-based authentication protocol could ensure the &lt;strong&gt;safe authentication&lt;/strong&gt; while also allowing for greater &lt;strong&gt;flexibility and interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identity-as-a-service-and-data-management&#34;&gt;Identity as a Service and Data Management
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are particularly apt to enable tighter control of users over their data. In the wake of Cambridge Analytica, and other data over-sharing and data breaches related scandal (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;), consumers are realizing how exposed their data can be and &lt;strong&gt;the lack of control their have over it&lt;/strong&gt;, once they hand it to a service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom industry actors and particularly mobile service providers could play a role to prevent further scandals and breaches from happening. They could provide consummers with the next generation of data management services (Identity as a Service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced projects, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.civic.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uport.me/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uPort&lt;/a&gt; are looking to reshape the way we share data online. Their users create a blockchain-backed identity and populate it with the pieces of information they are willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such identity can be represented by the address of a smart contract or a traditional public key. Since other smart contracts can control smart contracts, they can be programmed to support various methods of key recovery logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mobile-data-reselling&#34;&gt;Mobile data reselling
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since telecommunication networks are built on top of legacy implementations, some usage situations can get almost nonsensical. For instance, if a French (with a French mobile/data plan) travels with his phone to the US and browse the web, all his traffic will be routed through France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interconnection cost for the service provided, as well as the margin taken by the operator dramatically increase the price he has to pay. He could purchase data from a local instead. Using a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic data reselling network&lt;/strong&gt;, he can get the data bandwith he needs from a nearby American with some spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be able to browse in a much more cost-effective fashion. Thanks to the transactional capabilities of blockchain based systems, they are excellent candidates to power a worldwide data reselling network.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;DENT&lt;/a&gt; which connects to over 400 mobile operators in 130 countries. They aim to accelerate the decrease of roaming fees, to bring them as close as possible to the operational costs. DENT or other similar projects are looking to make use of the spare capacity available on the network and data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-sourcing-and-decentralizing-the-telecommunication-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Open-sourcing and decentralizing the telecommunication infrastructure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of supplementing the current telco infrastructure, some projects are more ambitious. Their goal is to build a &lt;strong&gt;brand new and decentralized infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of such projects believe that a decentralized network would be more apt to sustain the growing data needs while offering more security guarantees to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://qlcchain.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;QLCChain project&lt;/a&gt; dubs itself as “decentralized network as a service”. They set to construct an open-source telecom infrastructure on the blockchain. The network is powered by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardware&lt;/strong&gt; (BaseStation),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; enabling the transaction of network services and the execution of smart contracts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as well as &lt;strong&gt;a token (QLC)&lt;/strong&gt; to structure the exchanges of value within the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is currently testing the network, looking to open it to the public by the end of the year. Here is a high-level overview of their network infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-telco-related-blockchain-usecases&#34;&gt;Other telco-related blockchain use cases
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology develops, new use cases are enabled. We presented four credible and interesting ones that can turn into massively used services in a relatively near future. There are however many other use cases that could be envisioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing intermediaries involved in services such as &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name Service&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NAT&lt;/a&gt;), or even fully decentralize them. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://peername.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Several solutions are already implemented&lt;/a&gt; to replace traditional DNS on the web and provide a name service to resolve public keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring &lt;strong&gt;credit reselling&lt;/strong&gt; of internet-level communication networks, particularly for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;VoIP resellers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, creating a protocol to resell minutes of voice communication over the VoIP network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transparency provided by blockchains, as well as their resistance to attacks and alteration makes them a perfect fit for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/07/blockchain-for-fraud-prevention-industry-use-cases/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fraud prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits-for-industryactors&#34;&gt;Benefits for industry actors
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As blockchain-based technologies mature, they will enable &lt;strong&gt;new revenue streams and partnership opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; for existing telecommunication service and network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of blockchain based networks and services will dramatically &lt;strong&gt;change the balance of power and profit between existing intermediaries.&lt;/strong&gt; New partnerships will be formed, some legacy intermediaries might become obsolete and replaced by cheaper, faster and more effective alternative. Skipping such intermediaries will streamline operations and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the financial dimension of the telecommunication operations, blockchains enable many opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Near real-time settlements&lt;/strong&gt; offered by digital payment systems will simplify accounting procedures and reduce operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new validation mechanisms provided by blockchain will streamline accountability even further. Instead of relying on disparate systems to find and collate different financial views, a blockchain ledger will provide &lt;strong&gt;one unified view covering almost all transactions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain is still at an early development stage. The main challenge right now is to correctly identify relevant and realistic upcoming opportunities to direct developments and investments purposely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further the impact of blockchain and telcos, check out the paper published by Deloitte’s Blockchain Institute: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/za_TMT_Blockchain_TelCo.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;governments-vs-lex-cryptographica&#34;&gt;Governments VS. Lex Cryptographica
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal framework surrounding such system is currently lax, if not wholly lacking. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;most of&lt;/strong&gt; existing &lt;strong&gt;regulations focused on the financial use cases of blockchains&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Initial Coin Offering (~IPO for tokens). While this is perceived as a risk by most legacy industries actors, others see it as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since control mechanisms are built into blockchain-based systems, there might be no need for laws once they systems are mature enough. Such systems could &lt;strong&gt;implement their own regulatory frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;. The Harvard University Press published a fascinating read addressing the topic earlier this year. What follows is a quote taken from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Blockchain technology facilitates the emergence of new self-contained and autonomous systems of rules that create order without law and implement what can be thought of as private regulatory frameworks, which we refer to as *lex cryptographica*.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is stability a necessity for cryptocurrencies mainstream adoption?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Is stability a necessity for cryptocurrencies mainstream adoption?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you talk about cryptocurrencies with people unfamiliar with it, the question of volatility is among the first to pop up. Quite often, it’s a low effort way to dismiss the whole world of cryptocurrencies and recent progress made with decentralization. Volatility does not affect all cryptocurrencies: some of them are made to be stable (price wise) — we call them the “stablecoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that point, let’s state some necessary facts to understand this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies are much more than just the Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more than 1500 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap, which is only the tip of the iceberg: in reality, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies circulating. The sheer amount of tokens can be scary, but it’s positive in the long run. It means that for every problem cryptocurrencies can solve you have dozens of different teams exploring as many different approaches — no stone is left unturned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever the initial vision of Satoshi was, &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin is unfit to become a mainstream currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Its technical limitation such as its low transaction speed or the issues with mining (energy consumption, centralization, etc.) makes it inapt for this use case. However, its persistence (Bitcoin is almost 10 years old!) as well as its reliability makes it a good “store of value”, just like gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, there are many projects with the ambition to become tomorrow’s mainstream currency. &lt;strong&gt;They answer the fundamental issue raised when considering Bitcoin as a currency: its volatility.&lt;/strong&gt; Those projects are called &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; and they will be the topic of this piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of volatility highlights a vital characteristic of a currency: price stability is a necessity to have a currency people feel confident using. Indeed, creating a new currency requires a thorough understanding of both technical mechanisms as well as social dynamics. In order &lt;strong&gt;to become a currency, a good must be recognized as such by its users and gain their trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-fiat-goingsouth&#34;&gt;Are fiat going south?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a strong correlation between the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the “weakness” of the national currency (called fiat currencies) in a given country. It’s hard to measure the adoption of cryptocurrency, but we can easily get figures on how many people are interested in buying some using Google Trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghanaian currency (the Cedi — GHS) went from roughly a dollar in 2008 to around 20 cents nowadays. Meanwhile, the Nigerian currency (the Naira — NGN) lost about half of its worth (measured against the dollar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devaluation happened fast enough for people living in these countries to see the impact of it. It could explain the strong interest we observe for cryptocurrencies in Ghana and Nigeria. However, the issue with the determining how much a given currency is worth is more complex than simply measuring it against the dollar. If we use the dollar as our reference point, we must question its stability: &lt;strong&gt;is the dollar itself even stable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice about it, the “yes” seems like the go-to answer. The dollar hasn’t changed over these last 50 years — a $1 bill emitted in 1968 would still be recognized as such today. However, what about its worth? It is changing all the time. Is one 1968 dollar still worth $1 then? The answer is simply no — it would give access to a purchasing power corresponding to roughly 7 present days dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the spread is of course inflation. The topic is sophisticated enough to have theses written about it, so we’ll leave it to others. Now that we have some context let’s get back to stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-a-stablecoin&#34;&gt;What’s a stablecoin?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the stablecoin is pretty simple, the challenge lies in the execution. &lt;strong&gt;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that trades at a fixed price against a good (such as gold) or a common currency (most often the dollar).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stablecoin’s worth is not stable; it is merely its value that is pegged to a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable asset. Creating a reliable stablecoin is already a real challenge, so creating a fixed-worth currency is a wild dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the question of having a stable value is interesting to consider. How would it look like? That one unit of the given currency is always worth one unit? That’s DOGE’s specialty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/doge.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to more serious matters: the stability of currency could be defined as the fact that one unit of it always grant access to the same value. This definition would be consistent with the definition of a currency proposed in a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better-3b8e66cd2e77&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the link between the currency and the actual value it gives access to is elegant, in theory. However, in the real world, it’s close to impossible to measure the buying power of a given currency exactly. It is why we’ll consider stability defined as a currency keeping a constant price in regards to other goods or currencies which have a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable value. Before we get to the different stablecoin projects there are, let’s examine their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-stablecoins-goodfor&#34;&gt;What are stablecoins good for?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have live and available stablecoins such as the USDT. They are mostly used by crypto exchanges and traders because they offer a way to avoid returning to fiat currencies and having to abide by all the legal framework that comes with it. Moreover, since their price is fixed against the dollar they are somewhat of a safe haven for traders: with them, they can get out of the market without really doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, stablecoins are mostly a traders’ gimmick used to get in and out of the market without bringing their money back into their bank account. Hence, &lt;strong&gt;in the short-term, they are mostly a speculative tool&lt;/strong&gt;. However, they can provide a real utility in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cryptocurrencies have high volatility compared to fiat currencies, they are not really used as currency. Almost nobody is choosing to get their pay in cryptocurrencies, or using them to buy their groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a stable cryptocurrency well integrated with the rest of the ecosystem would provide a credible solution to address these needs. At first, stablecoins would be the gateway between the fiat and the crypto world. In the long run, they could become the “fiat of cryptos” themselves: &lt;strong&gt;they would become cryptocurrencies which are stable enough to become a preferred payment method&lt;/strong&gt;. It would provide a broader and more reliable access to the services offered by other (non-stable) cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-stabilize-a-cryptocurrency-liveexamples&#34;&gt;How to stabilize a cryptocurrency: live examples
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fulfill their promise of stable exchange rate against a given fiat, stablecoins must offer a &lt;strong&gt;collateral&lt;/strong&gt;. As a result, several types of stablecoins emerged depending on the collateral mechanism they used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fiat-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Fiat collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most direct and simple approach to make a stablecoin, but also the most centralized. In brief, there is a central entity minting the stablecoin who owns a reserve of dollar corresponding to the volume put in circulation. This dollar reserve offers guarantees regarding the solvability of the coin and allow to exchange the stablecoin back to a dollar at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, this approach comes with several issues. First, it’s &lt;strong&gt;completely centralized&lt;/strong&gt; since a single entity is emitting the stablecoin and backing it. There are no other choices but to trust it. Besides the approach is &lt;strong&gt;economically inefficient&lt;/strong&gt;, especially at scale, as it requires to “freeze” an amount of money equal to the number of stablecoins in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USDT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is used by the USDT, the most widespread stablecoin. Despite its adoption, &lt;strong&gt;the USDT is widely denounced&lt;/strong&gt; for its lack of transparency — there is no reliable method allowing its users to verify than Tether (the institution emitting USDT) actually possesses in its reserve a stock of dollar corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation: around 2,8 billion currently. However, the ties between Tether and Bitfinex (the 4th cryptocurrency exchange regarding the trading volume) raise questions regarding the potential for market manipulation it allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TrueUSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in answer to the lack of transparency of the USDT, TrueUSD uses the same mechanism while offering more guarantees. Rather than owning the token themselves, TrustToken (the institution emitting TrueUSD) works with a network of banks and financial institutions which keep the funds in escrow for them. One of them, Cohen&amp;amp;Company, publishes an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.trusttoken.com/trueusd-attestation-reports-86f693b90a4?gi=749091358366&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;independent audit&lt;/a&gt; twice a month to confirm that the financial partners of TrustToken do hold in escrow a number of dollars corresponding to the volume of TUSD in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guarantees offered seem more reliable than for the USDT, yet the problem is similar: this system requires its user to trust TrustToken and its partners, and particularly Cohen&amp;amp;Company to be honest. It works until it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crypto-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Crypto collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fiat collateralized stablecoins are fulfilling (so far) their promise of stability, they are doing a disservice to cryptocurrencies as a whole whose aim is to provide a decentralized alternative to the legacy financial and monetary networks. To answer this concern, another type of stablecoins emerged. They use other cryptocurrencies as collateral and a network of smart contracts to peg their exchange price to the underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this type of stablecoins is facing issues too, the main one being the volatility of cryptocurrencies used as collateral. To address them, they necessitate &lt;strong&gt;a collateral superior to the value of the stablecoins emitted&lt;/strong&gt;, which hinders their potential large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MakerDAO — Dai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai is another stablecoin pegged to the dollar (1 Dai = $1). It has some interesting features, the main one being that it is fully decentralized. Indeed, the institution emitting the Dai is MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. It’s an &lt;strong&gt;organization which governing rules are automated and enforced through publicly auditable smart contracts&lt;/strong&gt;, making them transparent and unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai works in pair with MKR, the governance token. Owners of MKR can vote to decide on the mechanisms used to stabilized the Dai. The system is quite complex and could deserve several articles by itself. Dai was launched on December 17th 2017 after three years of development. Since its launch, its price was in the same range of stability than fiat collateralized stablecoins (+/- ~10 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;un-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Un-collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stablecoins are the most promising in the long run as the address the main concerns raised by the two previous types: they propose a decentralized solution which could be used at scale. These projects are still in the development phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them use algorithms which reduce or increase the amount of the given stablecoin in circulation to stabilize their price. If the price goes over the dollar, the circulating supply increases; if it goes below, the supply decreases. The two most prominent projects in this category are Basis and Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis wants to create an “algorithmic central bank” that would stabilize its price. Their system uses three different types of token which makes it quite complex. The goal is to reproduce a simplified version of the federal reserve system with the addition of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Carbon is trying to execute an approached theorized in 2014 already by Robert Sams called the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage shares&lt;/a&gt;. The solution is mostly theory for now and has yet to see a working implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins-a-gift-or-a-curse-for-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Stablecoins: a gift or a curse for cryptocurrencies?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are a recent yet fascinating innovation. There are many projects currently in development (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stablecoinindex.com/projects/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;non-exhaustive list&lt;/a&gt;) using diverse approaches. The typology proposed above is simplified: some projects mix several types of collateral while others use radically different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, stablecoins are speculative &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tools&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; more than anything else, but they can become one of the critical elements of the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the long run. Looking at the volume, the USDT is currently obliterating its competition, which creates a systematic risk for the whole cryptocurrencies market. If USDT was to fail, it could lead to widespread panic. Thus &lt;strong&gt;speculation pushed the market towards a highly centralized tool lacking any real transparency: a gentle irony for the future of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 12:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/non-fungible-tokens-explained-with-blastoise-and-charizard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Non-fungible tokens explained with Blastoise and Charizard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-fungibles” — don’t let yourself be fooled by the mushroom-evoking name, fungibility is an old concept that is finding a second wind nowadays. It’s mostly about collectibles and video games for now, but it will soon outgrow these industries. Indeed, the potential of non-fungibles tokens is much more significant than this: from official documents to titles of ownership, their use cases are diverse and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by establishing the basics about non-fungible tokens (NFTs from now on) thanks to Pokémon cards before we dive into their potential use cases and the future developments of the underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tokens-smart-contracts&#34;&gt;Tokens? Smart Contracts?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we explore NFTs and talk about Pokémons, let’s restate two definitions necessary to understand the rest of the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;: A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token&lt;/strong&gt;: a token represents a particular tradable asset or a utility that is often found on a blockchain. Each token has specific properties that are defined to match its usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-does-fungibility-evenmean&#34;&gt;SO, what does fungibility even mean?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fungible good is a good defined by its belonging to a type: different units of fungible goods are interchangeable. “Fungibility,” as a concept, is used in several different academic disciplines; we’re addressing the economic definition only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump to the examples which make the concept much easier to understand. Our modern currencies, such as the dollar, are fungible: one $5 bill can be exchanged with another. Gold is also a fungible good: 1 ounce of (pure) gold is worth another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fungible good is standardized: each unit of this good has no uniqueness, which is why we can exchange them with one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-non-fungible-goods-then-can-we-still-eatthem&#34;&gt;What about non-fungible goods then? Can we still eat them?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some goods are non-fungibles. They are goods which &lt;strong&gt;share common attributes but have their uniqueness&lt;/strong&gt;: each good has a unique set of values for each trait which is shared with the whole type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best example of non-fungible goods are… Pokemon cards of course! While we’re at it, let’s pick the one that used to be enough to crown you king of the playground: Charizard himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A type: fire,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ability: Energy Burn,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attack and its cost: Fire Spin (4 fire energies),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness and Resistance: water and fighting,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A retreat cost: 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Pokémon card is unique, but all follow this typology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider Blastoise for instance: he too has the 7 attributes we have already described, but he has different values for each which make him different from Charizard and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/blastoise.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the combination of the value for all the attributes that make the cards’ uniqueness. Hence, a card describing a fire type Pokémon with 150HP is not a Charizard — it is merely a card with 2 attributes equal to those of Charizard, out of 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokémon cards are useful because they make most of the concept of non-fungibility easy to grasp. &lt;strong&gt;NFTs are a category of tokens that share common attributes&lt;/strong&gt;. But each token has a set of unique values for these attributes which make the token itself unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were too young for Pokémon cards, or too old, it’s precisely the same principle for other card games: Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh !, World of Warcraft (the card game) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fungibility-applied-to-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Fungibility applied to cryptocurrencies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the cryptocurrencies you already know such as Bitcoin or Ethereum can be considered fungible (see below ⬇️). One BTC is worth another and two BTC can be exchanged with one another. It’s the same for all cryptocurrencies you could find on Coinmarketcap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the history of transactions of most cryptocurrencies can be checked on block explorers, some tokens involved in illicit activity are flagged and blocked on exchanges. Therefore, cryptocurrencies with public transaction histories are not truly fungible. Full fungibility is currently achieved by privacy-focused coins such as Monero, because the transaction history is not publicly disclosed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t address these today, as we focus on non-fungible tokens. There were several attempts, as early as 2013 to create NFTs, but they were mostly unsuccessful. What made a difference was a new Ethereum standard, the ERC-721 which greatly facilitated the creation of “cryptocollectibles.” They are unique goods which share common attributes — the blockchain equivalent of Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-humble-beginnings-powered-by-theerc-721&#34;&gt;The humble beginnings powered by the ERC-721
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptokitties.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cryptokitties&lt;/a&gt; is what made NFTs known to the general audience — they are virtual kittens which were the precursors of the ERC-721.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/cryptokitties.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project went live in October and took a couple month to reach its peak of virality last December. Cryptokitties were such as success than the whole Ethereum network was clogged for several days by the flood of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/ck-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific kittens, the most desirable of the bunch, reached prices in the 5 digits ($) and changed hands several times in a few days early December. Considering the success of the CryptoKitties, the ERC-721 went through the due diligence to get approved and finalized last June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-fungible-tokens-in-the-everydaylife&#34;&gt;Non-fungible tokens in the everyday life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, collectible and video games are at the forefront of the innovation. Indeed, when it comes to pushing and improving new technologies, you’ll often find porn and video games sharing the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the real-world applications of NFTs are very diverse, numerous, and much closer than we think. Thanks to their characteristics, NFTs can be an excellent support for the tokenization of real-life goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokenize means creating a token representing a good. The token by itself has no value; it draws its value from the good it represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenize-everything&#34;&gt;Tokenize everything!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization allows to handle goods like tokens which open a wide range of possibilities: exchange, P2P transferring, fractional ownership (0.x), etc. Besides, other features can be added depending on the tokenized goods: list of the previous owners, history of the value of the good, exhaustive list of the goods’ characteristics, limitations of ownership…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the benefits of tokenization are understood, we realize that tokenizing real goods will let us &lt;strong&gt;spare ourselves the need for greedy intermediaries while getting many exciting new features&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of real estate =&amp;gt; who need notaries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of pieces of art =&amp;gt; auctioneers and several other jobs would see their utility and even their existence challenged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokenization of official documents (IDs for instance) =&amp;gt; a substantial cleanup in the actors and institutions currently involved in their emission, as well as those in charge of detecting and preventing frauds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three scenarios detailed above, checking the authenticity of these goods as well as making sure their owner is indeed the real owner of the good would be much easier than now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-disintermediation-thanks-to-tokenization&#34;&gt;The benefits of disintermediation thanks to tokenization
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokenization is much bigger than creating a token to represent a real-world good. Let’s come back to the definition of NFTs we proposed: “unique goods which share common attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tokenization would work as well for certificates. IDs, passports, report cards or even software license could be tokenized. Not only would it greatly facilitate the process of emitting and sharing them; it would also provide traceability, unlike anything we’ve ever known so far. Which in turns would make a 99.9% fraud detection and prevention goal a realistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we keep pushing the logic further, we could go back to the digital world and envision NFTs to store our digital identity. Our social network profiles could be open-source and easily exportable from one network to the others. Besides, it would give full control and ownership over our own data and prevent malicious third parties from stealing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get there, we need to &lt;strong&gt;overcome the current limitations of both the Ethereum network and non-fungible tokens&lt;/strong&gt;: as stated before, the CryptoKitties were enough to clog the whole Ethereum network for several days. The current state of the tech (or December’s state at least) is apparently insufficient for a large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ercsthe-new-standards-of-the-ethereumnetwork&#34;&gt;ERCs — The new standards of the Ethereum network
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Ethereum network, several teams are already working on the technical optimization of the network. Among them, we could mention Omisego/Plasma or the upcoming Ethereum update (Casper). Check the sources at the end of the article for resources on these matters; today we’re talking about NFTs so let’s get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-721 was a good start yet it faces many problems while going at scale. Before we get here, let’s zoom in on ERCs. An ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is a proposal submitted by an Ethereum developer. It introduces methods, behaviors, innovations or research that could be used to used to improve the network functionality. Once accepted, an ERC can become a standard — it’s quite a long process. Once again an example makes the concept much clearer: the most famous standard for Ethereum is the ERC-20. It described a fungible and straightforward token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The primary interest of ERCs is that they allow integrating the tokens within the ecosystem smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need to know the specifics of each token since they follow a set of methods shared with others (defined by the ERC). This is why a wallet which supports ERC-20 tokens support all of them without requiring particular development for each new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;erc-1155-the-future-of-non-fungible-tokens&#34;&gt;ERC-1155, the future of non-fungible tokens?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 is a new standard for NFTs proposed by Witek Radomski, the founder of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://enjincoin.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EnjinCoin&lt;/a&gt;, a platform made to facilitate the development of games with tokenized goods on the Ethereum network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 fixes many issues raised when trying to use NFTs based on the ERC-721 at scale, and also brings many new features. Regarding the technical optimization, the ERC-1155 allows sharing a given piece of code between several different tokens or collections of non-fungible tokens. It will enable to support a much higher volume of transactions for the same load on the Ethereum network (compared to the ERC-721).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/erc1155.png&#34;

&gt;
A transaction involving several fungible and non-fungible goods thanks to ERC-1155&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ERC-1155, it’s also possible to exchange several items in one single transaction. With ERC-721, if Bob wants to exchange its cryptokitties #1, #2, #3 and #4 for Alice’s Cryptokitty #5, it would require 5 different transactions while one would be enough using ERC-1155.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERC-1155 also supports fungibles goods which are plenty in online games: think about all the coins, potions, arrows and other consumables. Using only one standard, the ERC-1155, versus a mix of them (ERC-721 for non-fungible goods and ERC-20 for fungible goods) makes it much easier for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, ERC-1155 could treat NFTs in a group, allowing them to retain some fungibility. It would allow players to differentiation the different iteration of a same common object, and the first owner of it could prove he was indeed the first to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible goods are taking off, and Ethereum is a the forefront of the innovation. To better understand the ramifications of this concept, it’s best to go check its current usages. Let’s have a look at some games being developed/already available in pre-release versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/nft/godsunchained.png&#34;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://godsunchained.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gods Unchained&lt;/a&gt;: We used card games to introduce the concept, it’s only logical to find one here. Gods Unchained is among the most well-known one and uses the ERC-721 standard. The benefits compared to regular card games (such as Hearthstone) are numerous: immutability of the cards after the release (no more surprise nerfs), full transparency of the rarity of each type of cards, traceability of the previous owners of a given card… The team is focusing on eSports, and the first world championship will take place early 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://decentraland.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt;: Take Minecraft, in virtual reality with blockchain-based mechanisms to handle ownerships: Welcome in today’s Tomorrowland! Once they own a piece of virtual land, users can create/develop the experience of their choosing (thanks to the SDK); they will then be able to control the access to their land and make other users pay for it if they want. Decentraland is a human and social experiment at world scale. It will be seriously insightful!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Augmentors&lt;/a&gt;: Since we were talking Pokémon earlier, what about Pokémon GO? Augmentors combined Augmented Reality with blockchain to offer a game where NFTs allow each user to truly own their augmented reality creatures and trade them as they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissing NFTs could be tempting as for now it could appear like something for kids and nerds. Yet, it’s precisely the opposite: as the CryptoKitties have demonstrated it, NFTs are one of the best Trojan horses to drive the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralization-based mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new technologies, the technical development is only the warming up phase. &lt;strong&gt;The real challenge lies with the social and legal acceptance of the tech: on that front, CryptoKitties and other collectibles are precursors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 10:54:13 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/respecting-users-privacy-the-oddity-that-must-become-a-standard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Respecting Users Privacy - The oddity that must become a standard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, respecting your users’ privacy should be easy, right? After the revelations made by Snowden about the NSA practices and all other that followed, web hosting providers and other services changed their practices, right? That’s what we thought — and the illusion didn’t last for long. Today we take you on a little data tour: who’s collecting them, how, and for what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-thecontext&#34;&gt;SETTING UP THE CONTEXT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might know it; else we recommend you to read the manifesto — we recently launched a publication, EcoCrypto, that respects its users and their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding their attention, that’s our issue. However, when it comes to respecting our users’ privacy, it’s much bigger than us: we must double check each third party service we use to ensure they’re not abusing our (and your) trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we published the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ecocrypto.fr/manifeste/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, we realized &lt;strong&gt;how little people knew about the systematized data harvest that happens online&lt;/strong&gt;. We decided to write an article to provide a comprehensive overview of the main tracking solution currently enforced pretty much everywhere on the web. At the end of the article, we propose two sets of recommendations. The first one is for everyone: the very basics on how to protect your privacy online. The second one is specific to webmasters: how to respect your users’ privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-trackermania&#34;&gt;THE TRACKER MANIA
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each additional tracker is one more guest at the feast held on our privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: what’s a tracker? Essentially, it’s a small script one can place on his/her website — it allows the different services used to collect data on the visitors, therefore enabling new services for the webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tracker is like a snitch for a third party — &lt;strong&gt;each additional tracker is one more guest at the feast held on our privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-small-dozen-of-trackers-theminimum&#34;&gt;A SMALL DOZEN OF TRACKERS, THE MINIMUM?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To stay true to the original article (written in French for a French public), we kept French websites as examples. The situation is similar all around the globe, even worse in some countries .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any media website is using at the very least a dozen trackers. No need to trust us, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check by yourself using Ghostery&lt;/a&gt;: it lets easily you visualized all the trackers present on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little tracker-tour of a selection of the most visited websites in France:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leMonde.fr \[France’s #2 (audience) daily national newspaper\] — &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; different trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leFigaro.fr \[#1 Daily national newspaper\] —** 35**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediapart \[Online only publication\] — &lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;l’Express \[Weekly magazine\] — &lt;strong&gt;49&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tf1.fr \[#1 Private TV channel\] —** 35**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France2.fr \[#1 Public TV channel\] — &lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agence France Presse (AFP — French news agency) — &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the cleanest of the bunch, l’Humanité, still has &lt;strong&gt;10 different trackers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The measure was made on July the 18th, on the Homepage of every website. Remember to disable any adblocker or script blocker to see all the trackers on a given website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/trackers.png&#34;

&gt;
Elle.fr &lt;/p&gt;
\[Weekly women magazine\]
&lt;p&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;53 trackers&lt;/strong&gt;; Liberation.fr &lt;/p&gt;
\[Daily newspaper\]
&lt;p&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;40 trackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often, the people working on/for these websites don’t even know about the trackers. We reached out to French crypto publications to let them know about their privacy-intrusive practices. All said they were “surprised” to discover how extensive the net was. Some might say they were laughing at our face — you are the judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this little visit to the horror gallery we can conclude two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The owners/webmasters of 99% of internet websites are apparently not even thinking about respecting their user privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The users of these websites don’t know about the tracking and its consequences. Therefore, they don’t ask/push for practices that would be both cleaner and more respectful of their privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is any change coming up, it will come from the users: we need to be demanding and uncompromising. To do so, one must know what one is fighting against — let’s start a quick tour of some of the shadiest practices taking place in the online tracking world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-typology-of-thetrackers&#34;&gt;A TYPOLOGY OF THE TRACKERS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several different types of trackers, here’s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising trackers&lt;/strong&gt;: These trackers allow webmasters (and advertising services) to collect additional data when a user goes on a website — this data is then used to increase the effectiveness of the ads. The most common are Double Click and Facebook Ads. We’ll give more details on a subsection of the advertising trackers — the pixels — a little below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistics services trackers&lt;/strong&gt;: the most famous is Google Analytics, but there are many others. They’ll have their section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social networks trackers:&lt;/strong&gt; they allow for a direct integration of social media on a website, such as liking a Facebook page from a media website. It means that the user is identified (through his/her Facebook/Twitter/X profile). One last thing: no need to interact with the buttons to be recognized — that’s the whole beauty of the mechanism.

&lt;h4 id=&#34;visitor-stats-and-an-extremely-detailedprofile&#34;&gt;VISITOR STATS… AND AN EXTREMELY DETAILED PROFILE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each webmaster has the same issue: he/she needs stats to know the most visited pages or articles, where his/her users are coming from, how many are they… To do so, the go-to is to implement Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition of Google Analytics is pretty straightforward: Google is an expert on data collection and processing, you’re probably not. Implement this little script and Google will do most of the work for you: collecting the data, processing it, or presenting it in comprehensive dashboards. It’s convenient, and most (if not all) websites now use it. The issue? All the data is going through Google, putting it another way: &lt;strong&gt;Google is now collecting data on 99% of any websites users, straight at the source (on the website).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If each website were a bar, the Google Analytics situation would be similar to having a Google Home with the mic always on at the very center of the room. It’s already annoying and problematic when it’s just a few bars/websites. However, now, since almost all websites use this mechanism, it became the web all-seeing eye / all-hearing ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who handled a website with Google Analytics implement knows what we’re talking about: the amount of data available on any user is staggering. It’s hard to give a precise number because each implementation of Google Analytics is different. Google itself boasts about its &lt;strong&gt;400 different “metrics and dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;” — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#mode=web&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here is the list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmaster rejoice! We suggest an alternative at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-advertising-and-user-privacy-strictly-irreconcilable&#34;&gt;ONLINE ADVERTISING AND USER PRIVACY: STRICTLY IRRECONCILABLE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talked about advertising trackers, it was a rapid overview. Allow us to zoom in a little here. First, some basics about online advertising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s paid by action: cost per click, per thousand views, per specific action (register, download an app…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All actions are not equal — a click can come from someone completely outside your main target or on the contrary from the potentially perfect customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online advertising campaigns can be adjusted in real time and at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the basics are clearly stated, it’s easy to understand that there is a choice to be made between privacy and online advertising. To optimize the online ads, one must collect more and more data to improve his/her targeting and avoid unnecessary expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/privacy.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online media and social networks often get quite lyrical about their “fight to protect users’ privacy” — don’t let yourself be fooled. &lt;strong&gt;All the most visited websites are big users of online advertising services and use many trackers: in short, they have no respect for their users’ privacy. Even worse: they are making money out of its violation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spy-pixel&#34;&gt;THE SPY-PIXEL
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still unconvinced? You think that “ethical advertising” is a thing? Let us zoom on a specific kind of trackers: the advertising “Pixels,” such as the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, it’s a little script that works a bit like Google Analytics. The webmaster implements the pixel on his/her website and gain access to extra (advertising-related) statistics and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On of the main interest for webmasters is that all the data collected will be available straight in Facebook Ads — it makes it much easier to optimize the ads: it’s a mandatory tracker for anybody who is dedicating a significant budget to the platform. Thanks to the pixel, the website owner can make the connection between the ads on Facebook and actions undertook on his website: signups, purchases, downloads, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with the Facebook’s pixel is the same as Google Analytics: since the pixel is now everywhere, Facebook is collecting data right at the source on most of the most visited websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/pixel.png&#34;

An example of a retargeting scenario using Facebook (source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.lyfemarketing.com/spa-owners-facebook-customers/facebook-retargeting-example/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lyfe Marketing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the pixel allows a specific kind of advertising campaigns called “retargeting”: the term refers to any ad where the targeting is made using the previous behavior of the prospects. A typical retargeting flow using Facebook (Pixel and Ads service) looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You go to a given website, let’s say a lawnmower shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smile, someone’s is spying on you! Thanks to the pixel, you’re immediately recognized, your “Facebook ID” (unique identifier of your Facebook profile) is added to a retargeting list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You go on Facebook and discover incredible sales of lawnmower straight in your newsfeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-little-gifts-discovered-by-theway&#34;&gt;THE LITTLE GIFTS DISCOVERED BY THE WAY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into our recommendations, let us examine a concrete example that tells a lot about the challenge it became to respect the privacy of your website users online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of WordPress? It’s a framework (~engine) allowing you to create blogs and websites easily — this is what we use on EcoCrypto… for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A default WordPress installation uses a service called Gravatar: thanks to it, each user (=anybody who write articles or comment on one) can have his/her very own profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, users can go on gravatar.com, create their account and set their profile picture once — Tada! Your picture is now on every WordPress using Gravatar without having you to set it up again. Nice, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that the reality behind the gimmick is quite ugly. Gravatar uses the email to match its user with his/her profile picture. It means that &lt;strong&gt;by default, anyone commenting on a Wordpress sees his/her email getting a free round-trip to Gravatar’s servers.&lt;/strong&gt; With the round trip, Gravatar can build a list of the users of every WordPress installation — still looking for that sweet custom profile pic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many alternatives exist, and they can be set up in a few clicks, but since Gravatar is enabled on all installations, it’s still widely used. &lt;strong&gt;The default installation, combined with the widespread ignorance of the practice allows Auttomatic (Gravatar’s developers) to stuff itself with the emails of its users unknowingly collected over the years.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;To go further, here’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/44717/is-gravatar-a-privacy-risk&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;an interesting read on Gravatar’s privacy issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of scenario repeats itself over and over again when it comes to privacy. Everyone agrees with and supports the concept, yet only a few really look into it. On the business side, the “respecting your users’ privacy” theme is nothing else than a potential communication topic: it’s rarely enforced at the software level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-can-wedo&#34;&gt;SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tried to stay concise and not delve too much into the technical details — we’ve omitted many practices, this article is not exhaustive at all. Dozens, probably hundreds of different tricks and mechanisms exist to track and spy on users online. Some are much more insidious and harder to counter than others, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://panopticlick.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fingerprinting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What inspired this article is the surprisingly hard journey to set up a simple blog that respects its readers’ privacy. &lt;strong&gt;We’ve left this topic to the experts, and because of that we are reaching a situation where violating the privacy is now the norm — and those who want to respect it struggle.&lt;/strong&gt; All of this happening while Apple, Google, Facebook and others are painting themselves as “privacy champion” in front of the general audience, while they are the first to systemize the very end of the idea of privacy. We should fight back, or maybe we should have ten years ago already? It’s never too late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toolbox-the-bare-minimum-to-protect-yourprivacy&#34;&gt;TOOLBOX: THE BARE MINIMUM TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news (there is one!) is that protecting your privacy necessitates that you block all the ads — as well as the script that detects if you have an adblocker or not. Stealth has a bright side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is the bare minimum setup, you must go much further to be really covered, if ever possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-block-theads&#34;&gt;1. BLOCK THE ADS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chrome users, we recommend the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-adblocker/gabbbocakeomblphkmmnoamkioajlkfo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Adblocker&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Defender&lt;/a&gt; (anti ad-block defuser) combo: it’s easy to set up and works well. Firefox users can use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; for similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Whatever adblocker you chose, don’t forget to enable the EasyList corresponding to your country. Here’s a demo GIF for the French list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/adblock-fr.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try your setup by visiting any media website with the adblocker enabled; you’ll see a lot of free space! Insidious ads such as sponsored posts (“native advertising” as professionals call them) are not blocked — beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-list-and-block-thetrackers&#34;&gt;2. LIST AND BLOCK THE TRACKERS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads are only the start. Now we need to tackle the trackers. The good news is that there are very extensions to take care of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/privacy-badger.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger is developed by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/about&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the EFF — the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that has been defending civil liberties in the digital word for years — it’s not enough to blindly trust them, but it does provide reassurance. You don’t need any specific setting, but you might want to have a look at the trackers list (by clicking on the extension icon) and disable those you don’t need. At the beginning of the article, we mentioned &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ghostery&lt;/a&gt; — it also works quite well, and might be easier to use for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-use-https-everywhere&#34;&gt;3. USE HTTPS, EVERYWHERE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, the exchanges between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is now widespread, but its implementation on certain websites is quite messy: they’ll make you switch back and force between the secured and regular HTTP. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, another browser extension from the EFF solves the issue: it forces websites to use HTTPS whenever it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;additional-notes-on-privacytools&#34;&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTES ON PRIVACY TOOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be even safer, use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; Chrome. If you’re looking for sensitive stuff online, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;use TOR at least, it’s super easy to set up&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, if you want to be a little safer, look for more sensitive stuff, or leak critical information please check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TAILS — an operating system (Linux based) made for privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Before going to the dark side of the web, READ and document yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the article short-ish, we limited ourselves to three tools. &lt;strong&gt;To really cover your digital steps, you’ll have to go much further.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have easily listed a hundred of different &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tools&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; relevant for different situations — it would be pointless. You need to be able to pick the most suitable tools for your usage by yourself. To do so, there is no other way than lifting the hood to delve into the technical stuff. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy is not given nowadays; you must fight for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around the globe, nonprofits are doing their part with their means. The EFF edits a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ssd.eff.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Surveillance Self Defense guide&lt;/a&gt; which could be an excellent place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;respecting-users-privacy-as-a-webmaster&#34;&gt;RESPECTING USERS PRIVACY AS A WEBMASTER
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are handling a website, the most critical action you could start with is breaking free from Google Analytics. We have chosen &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://matomo.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matomo&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source and &lt;strong&gt;self-hosted&lt;/strong&gt; analytics solution. The self-hosted part means that the data stays on our servers: it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your hosting provider, setting up Matomo might be more or less accessible. If your hosting provides supports &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.softaculous.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Softaculous&lt;/a&gt;, the installation will be done in a few clicks. Else, you might need to learn a thing or two on server management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other actions you can undertake will depend on the services and framework you use. Rather than a list of tools, let us suggest a methodology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party services minimization&lt;/strong&gt;: reduce to the very minimum the number of third-party services you use. Each new service is a potential risk both for your website &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/security&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and for your users’ privacy. Even a decent, honest service can go rogue in a flash, and it won’t warn you about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate any third-party service you do implement&lt;/strong&gt;: despite 1/, you’ll have to use some third-party services. Look into the developers of these services, their other products, the reviews. There might even be other people who audited their code and talked about it. Use open-source services whenever it’s possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget about online advertising&lt;/strong&gt; on the main services (Social media, Google…) — you can’t reach cost-efficiency on these services without violating your users’ privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help!&lt;/strong&gt; More and more people are getting “privacy-fluent” and would be &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;happy to help&lt;/a&gt; a well-intentioned webmaster to establish a decent setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 12:13:32 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Money 101 - Discarding the myth of bartering to understand Bitcoin better" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is a critical element of our modern societies: a slight change in its mechanisms can have a much broader impact than simply affecting the economy. Therefore, a better comprehension of these mechanisms will give you a better grasp on various topics ranging from Political Economy to cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a complex subject, even more lately if we consider all the &lt;strong&gt;convoluted systems and protocols&lt;/strong&gt; that were progressively built on top of it: monetary creation, central banks, inflation… With this piece, we’ll go back to the basics and eventually down to cryptocurrencies: What defines a currency? Why do we need them? What types of currencies do exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up for a quite an adventure in which we discard old but still prevalent tales and propose necessary new ones to make complex mechanisms crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-the-origins-ofmoney&#34;&gt;The Tale of the Origins of Money
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear about currencies, you often get a tale that is easy to understand and compelling; yet it’s just a tale. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we were barterers, the my chicken for your corn kind of deal. Then, since bartering wasn’t efficient, we needed a more standardised mean of exchange: a good that could pass as a store of value. Precious metals were the perfect candidates — they became coins, a form of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, later on, those coins evolved once again and became paper money — still a currency, but the origin of their value shifted: while a coin gets its value from its very material (the precious metal it’s made of), the paper money needs an institution to emit it and guarantee its value one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the digital era, money evolved one more time. It’s now all “digital” — just bits, 0 and 1 located somewhere in a server and transiting almost instantly in the fiber network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take our time to methodically deconstruct the tale in order to dismiss it, we’ll learn quite a few things along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;money-is-not-a-store-ofvalue&#34;&gt;Money is not a store of value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lets-burn-some-cash-to-understand-moneybetter&#34;&gt;Let’s burn some cash to understand money better
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s study together the example that made the distinction between the two very clear to me: let’s say I burn a $20 bill — will any value be destroyed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/joker.jpeg&#34;

&gt;
Thanks to the Joker for helping with the experiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… Simply no! What has been destroyed is my ability to claim the aforementioned value: I can’t exchange the ashes of my bill for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-itrain&#34;&gt;Make it rain!
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between a store of value and a claim upon value allows us to also understand &lt;strong&gt;the obsession with circulating currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, money is not wealth by itself: as long as the money is not claimed (spent for goods or services), it has no contribution whatsoever to the wealth of the given country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/fly.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our previous cash burning experiment to dig deeper: when I burnt my $20 bill, it had no impact on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the USA. Yet, if I start to burn millions of dollars, we might start to see &lt;strong&gt;secondary consequences&lt;/strong&gt; affecting the GDP: since there will be less money circulating, there might be less people using it to claim value (a beer, clothes…) and therefore an impact on the real economy of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those secondary consequences will &lt;strong&gt;only happen if the cash I burnt was meant to be spent&lt;/strong&gt; — if burning the bills prevented me from claiming the value they carried. Hence, if I’m a multi billionaire (so let’s assume: incapable of spending all of my money), I can burn millions of dollar without having any impact on the economy: those millions would have never flowed back into the economy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting a stop to the flow of money which would have changed hands without that stop is like preventing others to work to provide value; this value would have been exchanged for currency if the money was circulating freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;counterfeit-money-realvalue&#34;&gt;Counterfeit money, real value?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get over with the myth of money as a store of value, let’s consider a third and last scenario. Let’s say I print a very **well done stash of counterfeit money **— everybody take it for the real one. Now I give out those bills to normal American citizens, and for the sake of the simplicity of this example, the FED doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/print.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, the happy citizens who got free real-like yet counterfeit bills will start spending them for goods and services — they will claim what is rightfully theirs because of their ownership of the bills, hence increasing the GDP of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all of this is a scam, no value was actually created: I only printed and handed out fake bills that people think legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money barely is the key to the gold chest. When money itself, its physical medium, still had value (such as gold or silver coins), the content of the chest was still tied to the amount written on the key. Now, we are in a system where keys are changing endlessly changing hands without ever returning to open the chest. &lt;strong&gt;Our trust in our currencies is so high that the amount written on the key is sufficient and even authoritative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bartering-and-its-inefficiency&#34;&gt;The myth of bartering and its inefficiency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the first tale about the origin of money presented in the beginning of this article: was bartering really as prevalent as the story make it seems?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place some context to answer this question. We’re talking about a world where money doesn’t exist yet; hell, the very notion of “property” is even clear yet. &lt;strong&gt;Of course there were exchanges, but the “exchange protocol” was very different that what we picture behind the idea of bartering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/swap.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premodern agricultural societies were largely self-sufficient: exchanges between the member of a given community followed informal systems based on relationships: the “economy” was powered by gifting and reciprocity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, rather than the &lt;code&gt;my goat for your corn&lt;/code&gt; kind of deal, it was more like &lt;code&gt;I will help you build this house because I know how to do it. Later on, you&#39;ll help me furnish this other house since you&#39;re a skilled woodworker. If you don&#39;t, it can put an end to 1/our relationship, 2/your very place in the community&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Considering the system depicted above was informal, the “if you don’t…” part didn’t need to be stated, it was understood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the premodern agricultural societies depicted above, barter also existed but wasn’t the main mean of exchange: it was useful to be able to exchange with people who didn’t share the kind of relationship we depicted — for exchanges between communities for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-distortion-of-the-historians-lens&#34;&gt;The distortion of the Historian’s lens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be another reason to explain why the tale of the evolution from bartering to currency is still prevalent. &lt;strong&gt;To reconstruct the past, historians use remains found in modern times&lt;/strong&gt;. Coins stand the test of time. On the opposite, informal gift/counter-gift dynamics barely leave any traces behind them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;The Origin of Ancient Helixism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the example frequently chosen to illustrate the bartering system are doubtful. We’re talking about &lt;code&gt;goat vs corn&lt;/code&gt; deals, but is it realistic in the context of a premodern agricultural society? Since they were mostly auto sufficient, bartering was for goods that weren&amp;rsquo;t required for the community&amp;rsquo;s survival, since these were already produced within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;downplaying-the-role-ofbanks&#34;&gt;DOWNPLAYING THE ROLE OF BANKS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tale of the origins of money, banks look like mere intermediary. They provide more or less practical systems allowing the money to flow: it used to be ledgers, and it’s still is but now we have a clunky web interface to write/edit stuff in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this skip &lt;strong&gt;the crucial role played by banks in our current monetary systems: monetary creation&lt;/strong&gt;. For the sake of the easy-of-comprehension of this article, I won’t dive into the depths of it in here, a quick presentation of it will have to suffice. This mechanism is called the fractional-reserve banking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;fractional-reserve&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short and (too) quick explanation — a central bank emit a monetary base allowing commercial banks to issue currency by themselves through loans. When Bob comes to Bank of America for a $10,000 loan, BA is not pulling money from its reserve to credit Bob’s account. No, what happens instead is this: the amount written in Bank of America’s ledger next to Bob’s name is increased by 10,000, and that’s pretty much it. The confidence is the banking system is preserved through mandatory reserve, corresponding to a fraction (~10%) of the loaned amount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Which leads us to our next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bits-a-digital-ledger-is-still-a-good-oldledger&#34;&gt;The myth of bits: a digital ledger is still a good old ledger
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we are clear on monetary creation — made by bank and nothing more that an input on a ledger — let’s tackle the last myth surrounding money, the one that states that money became 0 and 1, bits stored somewhere on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/1000xcut.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In real life, the nature of money hasn’t changed&lt;/strong&gt;: the good old bank ledger is still authoritative. Its authority comes from the fact that it doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it draws its authority from the whole &lt;strong&gt;political, societal and judiciary system that surround it&lt;/strong&gt;. The way we interact with the ledger (analog or digital) doesn’t reshuffle the decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With credit cards, ATMs, online banking and all the others “innovations”, it might seem like our monetary system evolved. In reality, we’re still very close to our first monetary systems and our modern currencies follow pretty much the same rules as the old ones. &lt;strong&gt;Innovations and changes happened mostly at the interface level: how we interact with the ledger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/coins.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes happened at the monetary creation level, it used to be much simpler and a state matter but the rest didn’t budge much. Our modern currencies share more with the Gold Franc&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - pardon my Frenchness - that we imagine. Disruption has yet to happen on currencies, what we had so far is barely a parade of facelifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-sneak-peak-into-the-real-monetary-innovations&#34;&gt;A sneak peak into the real monetary innovations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed to lay out the groundwork in order to finally reach this point, the most interesting part: how does real monetary innovation looks like? The answer is not as simple as “Bitcoin”, it can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-the-ledgers-governance-mechanism&#34;&gt;Change the ledgers’ governance mechanism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: the current trust placed in our ledgers is due to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reputation of the institutions who handle the monetary systems, be it central banks, private banks or other institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The political, legal and societal framework built around banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general public ignorance of the mechanisms governing currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s not much to hold the whole monetary system afloat; don’t worry, you’re not the only one. Critics have been numerous and early; in the 80s the cypherpunk movement were already looking into alternative currencies to break free from the fiat ones.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiat currencies are intrinsically useless objects that serves a medium of exchanges. They only have value because a government maintain and guarantee it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cypherpunk experimented with digital currencies and eventually lead us to the Bitcoin introduced by Satoshi. With Bitcoin, &lt;strong&gt;the trust in the monetary institutions is no longer required&lt;/strong&gt; (“trustless”). Indeed, in short the idea is as follows: instead of trusting the banks and other institutions to maintain the ledger, why not make that ledger public (=blockchain) and rely on our peers instead? This system also requires the use of cryptography and mechanisms to reach a consensus on the public ledger (so there is only one), but that will be covered in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alter-the-innate-propriety-ofmoney&#34;&gt;Alter the innate propriety of money
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about a currency that depreciates if not used? It would help to keep it circulating. The idea is not new, it was theorised in 1916 already by Silvio Gesell and is called demurrage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a currency depreciating over time might seem scary at first as it contradict our intuitive comprehension of money (“&lt;em&gt;how can it be a store of value if its value shrink over time?”&lt;/em&gt;). We already have already established that this intuitive comprehension of money was far from the truth of the practical world. This kind of money has an evident interest for recessionary phases, as it promotes spending the money quickly and “punishes” hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;limit-what-kind-of-items-money-can-claim-be-claimedupon&#34;&gt;Limit what kind of items money can claim be claimed upon
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without even altering the innate proprieties of money, we can change what it can be exchanged for. Local currencies are a good example of this. If they are designed carefully, this kind of currencies can help revitalize the local economy and independent businesses. Local currencies are plentiful; the Brixton Pound (B£) is one of the most well known. The team behinds it does a pretty good job to explain their thought process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will provide you with a better understanding of money but most importantly that it sparked an interest and it makes you want to learn more about it! The actual monetary innovation has yet to happen. The good news is &lt;strong&gt;now that we have cryptocurrencies, it’s much easier to create new ones&lt;/strong&gt; — pretty much anybody can do it and it’s an excellent news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that all the mechanisms we talked about and many more will be implemented and tested at scale. They already are: there are more than 1500 traded cryptocurrencies and easily another 10 thousands local, confidential or developed for learning purposes. You would like to mint your own coins too?

&lt;p&gt;Beyond what blockchain can offer, maybe here lies the most valuable contribution of Satoshi. &lt;strong&gt;By creating Bitcoin, he paved the way and reminded the whole world that minting money isn’t reserved to states&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s the business of regular people too: you, me, us, and even your computer illiterate grandma should have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all changes, it sounds scary but if you think twice about it, it makes so much sense: &lt;strong&gt;who better than the future users themselves could design the currency the most fitted to their needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/naas/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Nation as a Service and its fractional citizenship- a good idea?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nationalists movements seem to be thriving, an equally interesting counter trend is shaping itself quietly. Despite nationalists’ wish to provide the services of the nation only to the purest of their kind, others countries are turning to the opposite direction: they are starting to provide services to non-citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia is one of the pioneers reshaping role of the nation and what being a “citizen” even means. Since the launch of the e-residency program, close than 30 000 world citizens applied. Yet e-Estonia is only beginning: the country is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/happy-3rd-birthday-to-our-global-e-resident-community-7143adc73994&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;aiming to reach 10 millions e-resident by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, for a country counting 1.35 million “physical” citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explore what a Nation as a Service entails, you’ll remark that all of its features already existing in regular nations. The NaaS simply take it so much farther than the nation itself become something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birth-of-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;The Birth of the Nation as a Service
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first introduced the concept in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/&#34; &gt;a very raw article&lt;/a&gt; that went from my head to Medium in 90 minutes. It started with a tale to introduce the concept that scared some readers and hurt the political sensibility of others. While passion could be nice, I wanted to offer a more formal take on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first introduced the concept, I depicted the “4 cornerstones of the Nation as a Service” as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of nation state, as we use to know it, becomes obsolete. Regular nations are decomposing or powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the void, “digital nations” emerge. They might be tied to real nations (like Estonia), entirely virtual, or even raise money (ICO?) to purchase a land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These digital nations will offer the same services offered by our current nations, on a narrower scope: they will focus mostly on business regulations. Then, the most advanced ones might expand their scope: finance, currency, healthcare, education…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, citizens won’t be tied to a nation by birth anymore. Citizens will compare the offers from different nations and choose their fit. They might have to pay for the service (Estionian e-residency is 100€ one time cost). Nations will compete with one another to attract citizens, and extreme concentration is possible (winner-takes-all market): there are no limits anymore to contain the amount of citizens a nation can have. We’ll observe the birth of “Citizenship portability” — changing nationality will be easier than changing of internet service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still stand by them, but allow me to dive deeper today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-formal-definition-of-the-nation-as-a-servicenaas&#34;&gt;A formal definition of the Nation as a Service (NaaS)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go straight to the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nation as a Service (NaaS) provides a digital fractional citizenship under a subscription model.&lt;/strong&gt; The definition might be short but it’s quite dense, let’s unfold it methodically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-is-digital-native&#34;&gt;The NaaS is digital-native
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of NaaS emerged over the last few years. The first full-fledged NaaS is e-Estonia which opened up its e-residency 3 years ago. Since these new nations were born in a digital world from start, we observe a drastic paradigm shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It translates into the incorporation of digital concepts in the very nature of the state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital first&lt;/strong&gt;: all public services are available online and remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data&lt;/strong&gt;: making public data accessible to all through APIs. This allow for the creation of third-party services for public infrastructure: the easiest example to grasp would be the app that gives the departure time of trains/metros/bus already available in most big cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data portability between public services&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need to resubmit information to every public service anymore. One submission to the relevant service is enough since the access is shared to other public services that might need it (with the citizens’ consent of course).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts might be hard to envision in practice, so let me take you to Estonia thanks to Kaspar Korjus (the managing director of the e-residency program). He depicts what it means in the real world while he talks about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/what-is-a-nation-children-born-today-will-grow-up-with-a-radically-different-answer-b31f14403c3c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the birth of his son Ruufus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information &lt;/p&gt;
\[The name, sex, date of birth and parents of the children, registered by the doctor at the hospital\]
&lt;p&gt; is really useful straight away because various parts of government would need it to better serve us as new parents, such as by scheduling health checks, supporting with child care and allocating our parental leave allowance. This would generate added hassle for new parents in most countries, but in Estonia the information begins flowing automatically between departments and agencies along our secure, decentralised information network known as the ‘X-road’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that e-Estonia is a digital nation built on top of a regular one. Now imagine what kind of efficiency a digital nation from start could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-offers-fractional-citizenship&#34;&gt;The NaaS offers fractional citizenship
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citizenship offered by a NaaS is not a full-fledged citizenship. So far Estonian e-residents can open up an Estonian bank account and own a business, but they can’t settle in Estonia or vote. The choice was made for practical reasons: it’s much easier to start small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next years, we will see new features added to the service provided by NaaS. Since the idea of single citizenship status for all citizens is already shattered in pieces, the logic will be pushed even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be different tiers of citizens who have access to different services. The most bare bone tier being the only made only of the identity verification protocols while the most advanced one will eventually offer something similar to our current citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-is-available-under-a-subscription-model&#34;&gt;The NaaS is available under a subscription model
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subscription model is the direct consequence of the fractional citizenship. Since the citizenship is now made of different parts citizens can choose to subscribe to or not, we can envision the establishment of a subscription model for the NaaS, with several different options ranging from a pure business citizenship to a full-fledged citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, in e-Estonia it’s a single 100€ fee to submit a candidacy. In the future, it might take the form a yearly/monthly subscription with different features. Here’s what I see, from the most basic to the most advanced one. The first two are already available in the Estonian e-residency in its current form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: provide a digital ID card allowing the holder to prove its identity to public or private services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: provide the ability to open a bank account and set up a business in the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: allows the benefactor to vote and participate in local (city/region) elections and create NGOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political citizenship:&lt;/strong&gt; allows the benefactor to vote at national elections and other public consultations such as referendums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription to the &lt;strong&gt;national Healthcare service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription to the &lt;strong&gt;national pension plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the &lt;strong&gt;full-fledged citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All these different features will probably be gated behind conditions, such as being an e-citizen for X years, and an additional fee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;citizenship-portability&#34;&gt;Citizenship portability
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another direct consequence of all three characteristic of the NaaS depicted below is the notion of citizenship portability. Since citizenships become subscription based, what used to be an edge case — changing nationality — will become commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more and more fractional citizenships available under a subscription model, “prospects” might start to compare the offers essentially putting citizenships in competition with one another. Some might even stack or mix and match different citizenship offers. E-Nations will have to account for this new trend and provide services to facilitate the switch from one NaaS to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;CONCLUSION
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was written to be nothing more than an analysis giving you a framework to read the current shift happening on the very definition of a nation. I tried my best to avoid any judgement one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I think the ongoing shift I described in this article will have tremendous consequences, many of which are not yet envisioned. I still can’t really figure how to feel about this, I jump from curiosity to anger, or from fascination to despair. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-crypto-bullshit-how-to-spot-a-shitcoin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to Crypto Bullshit: How to spot a shitcoin?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to invest in an ICO, or get your hands on some already traded coins? Awesome, welcome aboard! Before you jump in, let me give you some clues to spot shaky projects with examples taken from actual ones. These tips come from my experience (and failures) as well the discussion I had both with friends and the cryptocurrency community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-whitepaper-is-always-the-most-insightful-resource&#34;&gt;The Whitepaper is ALWAYS the most insightful resource
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitepapers (WP for the rest of this article) can be scary. While some manage to keep it short (~10 pages), others can reach the hundreds yet it’s the best place to gauge the seriousness of a project. &lt;strong&gt;It’s still the first thing I check once I’m seriously considering a coin&lt;/strong&gt;. So what should you be watching closely in a WP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-englishlanguage&#34;&gt;The English Language
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising? Not so much if you put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;how to trust an organization unable to put out a flawless WP with a decentralized cryptocurrency project?&lt;/strong&gt; It might seem small or even petty, but if you find a low-quality English or repeated typos in the WP, you better start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;big-promises-with-technical-vagueness&#34;&gt;Big Promises with technical vagueness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common, as most people won’t read the technical parts of the whitepaper. Even if you don’t fully get the technical details, the difference between a WP trying to cover its lies and a transparent one are quite apparent. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sficoin.co/white-paper/white-paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SFIcoin is the perfect example of this — DONT INVEST: SCAM&lt;/a&gt;, the full recipe is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big promises that don’t mean anything&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Next Global Paying System”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbacked claims&lt;/strong&gt;: their WP that details the vision, the roadmap, the use cases but doesn’t address AT all the tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, the SFICOIN is just going to be the first leading peer to peer cryptocurrency to manage the high-value instant payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We will be the first to X”&lt;/strong&gt;: massive red flag. There are no certainties in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A WP made by marketers for marketers&lt;/strong&gt; lot of visuals, a lot of work on design but overall it’s empty of real meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok for a WP to get quite technical (here is Stellar’s — XLM), but it’s not OK to cover an absence of technical solution with jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-darwin-awards-of-whitepapers&#34;&gt;The Darwin Awards of Whitepapers
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how does a terrible WP looks like? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://narbonne.io/Narbonne.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Check Narbonne’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been 7 months and I can’t find any worse. Out of the 22 pages, ~18 are spitting copy pasta about the future. Most of the paper is very generic, and so many things in it are so off. I had to pick one so here we go, the comparison between Narbonne, Ether&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;um and Wa&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;es. Yes, you read it right, they can’t even spell Ethereum and Waves properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things need to be debunked in this table, it’s actually a good exercise. Here are a few you do the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bookkeeping at the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;”: I’m not even sure what it means, but I think a project like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://request.network/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Request (REQ)&lt;/a&gt; covers this for Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Mobile Banking”: Hello &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omisego.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OmiseGo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“AI, chatbot, voice control”: strictly no use for the project (an infrastructure for banks) but buzzwords so they had to be here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-does-a-proper-wp-looklike&#34;&gt;How does a proper WP look like?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WP is a &lt;strong&gt;technical document&lt;/strong&gt; usually presenting at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vision for the project / what problem the team is trying to crack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the technical solutions proposed to the problem and why they were chosen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The details of the technical implementation of the chosen solutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credible roadmap for the delivery,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical information about the token: token type, total amount, token mechanisms…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifications for the ICO, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hone your skills, there is nothing better than the OG! I invite you to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;original Bitcoin’s whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; written by Satoshi. You can also check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ethereum’s WP&lt;/a&gt; to remind you that &lt;strong&gt;the design doesn’t have to be fancy&lt;/strong&gt; (it’s a GitHub wiki) if the fundamentals are sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardano’s WPs: split between a “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/philosophy/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;philosophical WP&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/academic-papers/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;academic papers&lt;/a&gt;, I think the team does an outstanding job to make their project intelligible to those interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transactions-per-secondmyth&#34;&gt;The Transactions per second myth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the whitepapers covered, let me address another big chunk of today’s article: the myth of the transactions per second (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;transaction-per-second-a-convenient-lie&#34;&gt;Transaction per second: A convenient lie
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPS doesn’t mean anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt; So why is it so popular? Well, it’s a bit like the GHz for processors: it used to be the only thing advertised. It makes sense in a way, &lt;strong&gt;it gives the impression&lt;/strong&gt; that you have a standard allowing you to compare different processors that are actually not comparable: higher is always better right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. You can have a 32 bit 1 core processor operating at 3.5 GHz and a 64 bits 8 cores processor operating at 2 GHz. Guess which one delivers the most computing power? It’s the second one without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the same for the tokens, except it’s not only the power that matters here. Let me pull &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-decentralization-matters-a-12-min-overview-for-the-layman-6ec572d35af6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a quick reminder from my previous article if you missed it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the TPS is meaningless, it’s almost expected now. Newcomer investors will put significant trust in this very misleading indicator, and most projects advertise a given TPS. Good! It gives you a good sign of how honest they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-tps-to-cut-through-thecrap&#34;&gt;Using TPS to cut through the crap
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider coin A, advertising 1M TPS and coin B advertising 10 TPS. What about the features they support? What about decentralization? What about the team vision? Community support? Simply by looking at the number, I know now that Coin A is bullshit and coin B could be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/nano.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;nano&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current state of the art of tech allows for a maximum of ~10 000 TPS (already huge) without excessive centralization.&lt;/strong&gt; Any coin promising something higher than this is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making compromise on decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@CryptoPeterG/eos-centralization-problem-bd7a392eeed2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The prime example of this EOS&lt;/a&gt; and its 21 block producers that have tremendous power over the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lab scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: you can see some coins advertising crazy TPS, some will even show a test network supporting their claim. The thing to look for is the setup of the test network: usually, it’s just a few nodes. It’s easy to reach a high TPS on a three nodes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets harder and harder as the nodes multiply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking on novel and previously untested technological solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nano.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NANO&lt;/a&gt; uses a new kind of ledger called block-lattice and supports up to 7 000 TPS in ideal conditions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.iota.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt; which uses another radically new solution (the Tangle) currently supports ~800 TPS, but it will scale with user adoption. Those two are the most radical “ledger innovations” there are and the most promising. They are the current state of the art: to me any project advertising TPS over this without an equally radically new technical solution is instantly suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including &lt;strong&gt;off-chain scaling&lt;/strong&gt; solutions in their computation of TPS, which leads back to point one: excessive centralization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including new mechanisms such as sharding&lt;/strong&gt; in their computation. Ethereum which has arguably one of the most robust dev community there is, is still 1 to 2 years away from a live implementation of sharding. How could a bunch of newcomers pull this in 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling this number out of their hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A cryptocurrency development project often starts quite centralized. What matters is that the team have a plan to open up the network progressively. For instance, NEO is quite centralized for now, but now that the infrastructure is sound&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://neo.org/blog/details/4089&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;the team is making moves towards decentralizing more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we conclude, let us dive into the crazy world of ICOs, it’s such a wild west that it deserves another section by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;icos-red-flags-to-lookfor&#34;&gt;ICOs red flags to look for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;huge-discounts-for-earlybirds&#34;&gt;Huge discounts for early birds
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see an ICO offering huge discounts (&amp;gt;30%) on the first phases of the sale that’s usually a recipe for disaster. Indeed, it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the early birds get such a large discount, they have a &lt;strong&gt;strong incentive to dump at ICO price or even a little below&lt;/strong&gt; once the token hit the market: it’s guaranteed free money if they sell fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should the team need such a strong incentive to drive the sale? I see this pattern a lot for &lt;strong&gt;tokens with close to no utility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the two situations above don’t unfold, one is guaranteed: huge discounts push towards a concentration of the tokens in the hand of a few: it attracts whales. Massive discounts are a recipe for &lt;strong&gt;political centralization and governance problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-product-demo-orcode&#34;&gt;No product, demo or code
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big risk with ICOs is that you’re essentially investing on a promise or a vision. Yet some ask for money once they already have a working alpha while some others run straight to the ICO as soon as the WP is ready. The latter is much riskier. If there is an alpha or a demo version available, please do check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a dev, &lt;strong&gt;it’s always insightful to check the GitHub repository of the project.&lt;/strong&gt; GitHub makes it easy to see how active the repository is, even without looking at the code. This method is far from perfect are there are ways to make it look like a repo is active even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-team-doesntmatch&#34;&gt;The team doesn’t match
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are seriously considering investing in an ICO, I urge you to google the most prominent team members. Look at their LinkedIn, their Twitter, their previous companies, etc. If you find inactive profiles, it’s usually a pretty bad sign. You might also find skeletons in the closest, such as one team member who participated in another crypto project that turned out to be a failure or a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Banano, a NANO fork&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low quality or frequency social media presence is also a bright orange flag. These guys will have to market their project, acquire users and partners. If they can’t market themselves, it’s already a shaky start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also very common for ICO scams to advertise a prestigious advisor… that has nothing to do with the project&lt;/strong&gt;. Double check any high profile figure to make sure they are actually involved in the project. If you see Satoshi as advisor, RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;inappropriate-token-distribution&#34;&gt;Inappropriate token distribution
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token distribution chart is usually present in every WP. If it’s not, it’s essentially like “give us your money, and we won’t tell you what we’ll do with it”… RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually looks like a pie chart. The most transparent projects have two: one for the distribution of the tokens, and one covering how the funds will be spent by team.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Storm token distribution is pretty good (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.stormtoken.com/token-structure-and-ceo-update-bd055860251e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok, even good that the team reserves a share of the token for the development of the project. You have to watch the share allocated to the team: it can range from 10% to 30% for the reasonable projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme of the spectrum, you have coins like Ripple (XRP) for which the team owns ~60% of the total supply. It is a significant risk for token holders: first, it’s an enormous vector of centralization. Besides, it means that &lt;strong&gt;the team can heavily manipulate the price of its coin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A few months ago, facing a backlash against this very centralized distribution, the team put an escrow system in place using a smart contract.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ripple.com/dev-blog/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;55 billions tokens are now placed in escrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and released at the pace of 1 billion per month. It doesn’t change anything to the underlying centralization issue and makes me wonder which kind of team would need $500 million (current price of XRP ~ $0.5) each month for its development/partnership/other. Besides,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;since these tokens are now locked they are not counted in the circulating supply (~39B)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which might reassure investors but is purely misleading. The actual supply is 100B tokens. Personal view: the whole move feels like a marketing stunt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article to provide you with some clues to help you spot unreliable crypto projects. Overall, I hope that you understand by now that &lt;strong&gt;the more you read before investing, the lower the risk will be&lt;/strong&gt;. I advise you NOT TO INVEST IMPULSIVELY. Even if it’s the best project in the world, you can sleep on it, read some more and decide a couple of days later with a fresh outlook if you want in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, let me give you more tricks I use to get a quick idea of the seriousness of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google search &lt;code&gt;site:reddit.com &amp;quot;token name (+scam/shitcoin/issues...)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;: this method allows you to search Reddit for a specific token. If there is a massive red flag on the project, it&amp;rsquo;s usually documented somewhere on Reddit. &lt;em&gt;Additional note: Reddit is getting quite tribal now. The best place to find reliable information on a given token is certainly not the token subreddit. Don&amp;rsquo;t go to /r/Ripple/ if you want an objective perspective on XRP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t trust one single source, always cross them!&lt;/strong&gt; Greedy people are promoting shaky projects all around the internet, never blindly trust just one guy even if he seems to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several services exist to organize the community due diligence on ICOs. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://icocheck.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ICOCheck&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty reliable one, but do your own due diligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: &lt;strong&gt;I strongly recommend you to not invest in ICOs for at least the first year you’ve been invested in cryptos&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of them fail dramatically. You are much better off limiting yourself to the top 25/100/200 tokens depending on the risk you’re willing to take. Even among those, there are many doubtful projects: beware and happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

A 12 min overview for the layman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public is hearing more and more about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and cryptocurrencies, the philosophical and political underlying of decentralization are still kept mostly within the community. &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is bringing a paradigm shift that deserves more coverage than price action in my book&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I realized that I didn’t really understood decentralization. I got the high-level concept, but I failed to connect all the dots and &lt;strong&gt;understand the social and political ramifications of it.&lt;/strong&gt; Since then, I’ve done my homework and now it’s time to give back my humble understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Simpsons: Season 16, Episode 19 — Thank God it’s Doomsday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is not an easy change to apprehend. Imagine yourself in the internet early days, let’s say 1995. Could you have thought about all the potential use cases for this new tech and how they were going to unfold? Back then, you even had prominent actors from the tech industry &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;predicting the uselessness or failure of the internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Metcalfe, in InfoWorld, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waring Partridge, in Wired, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to laugh at them now, but ask yourself this question: Aren’t you doing exactly the same thing with decentralized services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first audience for this article are people who read two articles from mainstream medias before concluding that decentralization is stupid. &lt;strong&gt;Let me be the third and the charm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medias are here to promote emotional content that makes you react, so you get your dopamine shot and come back. They are not here to help you learn and grow. They caused their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one am simply a 26 years old French dude with a knack for writing and time on his hand. &lt;strong&gt;I have nothing to sell to you, but simply one goal: help people to realize what’s happening, so they can be part of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested the draft on people aged anything from 20y old to 60+. &lt;strong&gt;It’s foolproof, as long as your willing to lend me 12 minutes of your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll gain a framework allowing you to see decentralization for what it is: the premise of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is hard, scary and confusing. It destroys your previous references and leaves you in a world where you have to re-think everything again. It’s a lot of work to adapt, but the earlier your start, the easiest it is, just like it happened for Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share this piece with your decentralization-sceptic and decentralization-enthusiast friends alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-is-multidimensional-spectrum&#34;&gt;Decentralization is multidimensional spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious to some, but it’s an important fact: &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is a spectrum, not a state&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes from the most centralized systems possible, such as our current fiat monetary systems (&lt;strong&gt;“Central”&lt;/strong&gt; Banks decide pretty much everything) to the most decentralized systems, such as the English language (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here is an interesting infographic giving you an overview of the centralization of major industries:&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Lillian Wei, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-governance-how-decentralized-do-we-need-to-be-799a7988ce84&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you get the spectrum of decentralization, the second thing to understand is the &lt;strong&gt;different dimensions of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is than in absolute, they aren’t any typology of the different dimensions of decentralization. To make things easier, I’m gonna use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgStgMyR9sY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the one proposed by Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder of Ethereum, one of the leading decentralization projects) that features three main dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-architectural-dimension&#34;&gt;1. The Architectural Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This dimension is easy to grasp because about the physical things&lt;/strong&gt;: the devices, the servers, the stuff! The architectural dimension address &lt;strong&gt;the base units of the network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize architectural decentralization, you’ll need to multiply the devices powering your &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, and spread them around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Visualizer: Tangle.glumb.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know how architecturally decentralized a system is, you can ask these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many underlying devices are powering the network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they geographically spread or concentrated in one area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-political-dimension&#34;&gt;2. The Political Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics is about power. This dimension address the &lt;strong&gt;decision making process of the system&lt;/strong&gt;. The most politically centralized protocol is one where a sole decision maker makes all the shots. At the other end of the spectrum, you’ll have many actors and evenly distributed responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/decentralisation-layman/politics.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most politically decentralized systems, the spread between the least influential node and the most influential node is kept to a minimum. The perfectly politically decentralized network would offer the same influence to any node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good questions to determine how politically decentralized a system is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people/groups are involved in the decision making process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the power repartition looks like? What kind of criteria is used to weight each participant influence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they any recourse / appeal mechanisms built in the system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-logical-dimension&#34;&gt;3. The Logical Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logical dimension is by far the hardest of the three to understand. Don’t give up if you don’t get it from the first read! In Vitalik’s terms, it reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your system look like one thing single thing like a singleton or does it look more like an amorphous swarm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this dimension is about the differences between each nodes that compose the network. To maximize logical decentralization, you want them to diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let some fancy words scare you, it’s actually not so hard. Looking at examples really helped me understand this one, so here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A direct democracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture of a direct democracy is quite centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: there are a few places (parliament, chambers, police, military…) that are the nodes of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the architectural centralization, the decision power is spread in a direct democracy so &lt;strong&gt;the protocol is politically decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt; — aka it’s one main “body”. There is only one government enforcing one set of laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nation vs Federation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are architecturally centralized,&lt;/strong&gt; for the same reason than the direct democracy: there are only a few locations/institutions where the action happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are also politically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: the president/assembly/other elected or not officials hold most of the power, without any public oversight. You can’t swap president two years in, you have to wait the full term, even if the president lie, collude with foreign powers, mishandle public money… Hi to the elephant in the room! The federation might be a little less politically centralized than the nation, but it’s quite similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logical dimension is where things get interesting. While &lt;strong&gt;a nation is one unique main “body”, aka logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;, a federation is made of distinct “parts” that acknowledge and preserve their difference while working towards a common goal. Hence the federation is a good example of logically decentralized system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Source: Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The English Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture is very decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the English language as a protocol, a node would be any English speaking person. The good news is they are plenty, they are diverse, and spread all around the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The political dimension of it is also quite decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no single governing body deciding what English is and is not. Yes, there are official institutions publishing English Grammars for instance, but the grammar is not law: you can choose to follow it or not. The actual English, the one linguists study, is not the one depicted in a grammar, it’s the one spoken by all English speaking individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;it’s also very logically decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;. Two English speakers coming from different countries might speak an English that is very different from one another, because of the vocabulary, the emphasis, or even the sentence structure. You have many different kind of English spoken all around the globe: American English, UK English, my beloved Frenglish…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-three-dimensional-decentralization-spectrum&#34;&gt;Using the three dimensional decentralization spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each dimension is mostly independent from one another. &lt;strong&gt;You can have a service at one end of the spectrum for one dimension, and the other end on another&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-study-web-hostingservices&#34;&gt;Case Study: Web Hosting Services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) are the perfect example of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From an architectural perspective, they want their network to be as decentralized as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. As a hosting provider, AWS need to be reliable. To do so, they have many servers so that the redundancy builds resilience. Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;both for performance and security reasons, they have their servers spread all around the world&lt;/strong&gt;. It reduces latency and further increase resilience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, from a political perspective, Amazon has absolute control over the network. They can refuse to serve you, delete your content (if it’s illegal for instance) and the AWS user community no say on their decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Hence, on the political dimension, AWS is close the most centralized end of the spectrum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, on the logical dimension AWS is centralized, it’s a pretty monolithic company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-significant-hassle-than-can-be-worth-thetrouble&#34;&gt;A significant hassle than can be worth the trouble
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re clear on the decentralization spectrum, you might wonder why going through the hassle? Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;decentralized systems tend to be more complex and harder to manage that centralized ones&lt;/strong&gt;: they have many different components, a decision power spread between several parties and an accountability imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-decentralized-systems-efficient-for-computations&#34;&gt;Are decentralized systems efficient for computations?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those requirements weight on the system and slow it down, right? So why go through the hassle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it’s even more than that! It can be hard to find a relevant comparison between centralized and decentralized systems, but the price of computing power is probably the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, the ratio between the cost of the computing power on the Ethereum Word Computer vs a traditional one (ex Amazon EC2) is between roughly one million&lt;/strong&gt;. Scary ratio, right? (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xHiI-G_CQ&amp;amp;t=251s&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Don’t trust me, go here to check&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… yes and no. First, you have to consider how cheap computing power got over the last couple decades. We’re reaching a point where even just $1 spent on AWS represents a tremendous amount of computing power. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; presents the evolution of computing over the last 25 years with neat infographics:&lt;/p&gt;

Hard Disks dramatically increased in capacity while becoming more compact. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well, we’ve got to ask ourselves: does the comparison even makes sense? It can be useful to understand the current state of our tech, but does it tell us anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization&lt;/strong&gt;. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizations-benefits-the-edge-of-thecrowd&#34;&gt;Decentralization’s benefits: The Edge of the Crowd
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, decentralized systems offer a set of unique advantages opening a wide range of use cases. Let’s go through the main advantages one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;efficiency&#34;&gt;EFFICIENCY
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some cases, making a system decentralized is simply the best way to answer your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the physical distribution of post offices is decentralized. It wouldn’t be efficient to have all the post offices in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion that can play a large role for the efficiency of a system: &lt;strong&gt;spare capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider people who already own a resource (let’s say a house or car), but only use it 10% of the time. Instead of having to build a whole new infrastructure for your service, you can use instead the spare capacity that is already available: hello Uber or Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fault-tolerance&#34;&gt;FAULT TOLERANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a decentralized system is redundant (there are no elements that exist only once, all have many “copies”), &lt;strong&gt;the risk of the whole system failing accidentally is much more limited than a centralized system.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s precisely why web hosting services have to be architecturally decentralized. But many systems benefit from fault tolerance: consider the energy production/distribution network for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion quite useful to understand why decentralized system are resilient, it’s the &lt;strong&gt;SPOF. Single Point of Failure&lt;/strong&gt; is a term used in network infrastructure to describe an element than is not redundant: it exists only once. &lt;strong&gt;If this element was to fail, it would bring the whole system down, hence the name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still following, you should be able to connect the dots: since everything is redundant in a an architecturally decentralized system, there are no SPOF. If there is a SPOF, it means that there is a single/central element somewhere (that could break), hence it’s not a decentralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;attack-resistance&#34;&gt;ATTACK RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attack resistance is essentially a matter of cost/benefit. &lt;strong&gt;Unattackable systems don’t exist, what do exist are systems that are simply to costly to attack considering the potential reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider malicious actors that would be looking to damage the protocol not for direct financial benefit, but for something else. Maybe it’s a competitor trying to bring you down? Even in that scenario, the attacker would need to dedicate a lot of resource to have a chance to bring a decentralized system down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact to consider is also that information is spread over many devices. &lt;strong&gt;If an attacker manage to get control over one device, he only gets access to a fragment of the whole dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; It makes the system more resilient to hacks, as the data is less exposed. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.fr/search?q=ashley&amp;#43;madison&amp;#43;hack&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR792FR792&amp;amp;oq=ASHLEY&amp;#43;MADISON&amp;#43;HACK&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3446j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Too bad Ashley Madison wasn’t architecturally decentralized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;collusion-resistance&#34;&gt;COLLUSION RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind collusion resistance is to make it hard for one subgroup of the system to come together and act only for their own best interest, to the detriment of the whole system. The extreme example of collusion would be a monopoly — it lets actor gain an unfair advantage over the whole market and impose its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instance, in our modern democracies, collusion resistance is extremely low&lt;/strong&gt;: the common interest of the system (the betterment of the country) is frequently, some would even say systematically hijacked by specific subgroups (such as businesses) for their own benefits (profits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is a high level concept that is essential to understand blockchain and other decentralized ledgers. If you want to explore further, you can look at videos of founders of the major project explaining their vision to get a better idea of what a decentralized system enable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have missed the internet revolution, but you’re in luck for this one: it’s barely beginning! &lt;strong&gt;Now is the time to get knowledgeable about it so you can recognize and harness opportunities as they emerge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better understanding of the paradigm shift offered by the newfound ability to develop decentralized protocols at scale, thanks to blockchain. and other decentralized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>EcoCrypto&#39;s Manifesto</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/ecocryptos-manifesto/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 10:36:03 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/ecocryptos-manifesto/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome on Ecocrypto, the incorruptible French publication soon to become a reference. EcoCrypto was created to provide an answer the lack of honest and qualitative content in the French crypto ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manifesto establishes the rules we will abide by to ensure EcoCrypto starts and stays majestic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecocrypto-brings-a-slow-approach-to-news&#34;&gt;EcoCrypto brings a slow approach to news
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take our time to produce high-quality content. We don’t just write a commentary or a reaction to the latest news. We follow our own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have but one agenda: broaden the crypto world. We want to include as many people as possible in the discussion currently taking place in the cryptosphere. We think the crypto community would benefit from ALL perspectives, and especially the perspectives of those who are presently left out such as people who are unfamiliar with new technologies, or those who don’t speak English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We write content to make you think, to help you learn, and to challenge your views to broaden your perspective on the world as a whole. If a given piece of content cannot fit any other these three goals, it will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization and cryptocurrencies are our focus, but they don’t happen in a vacuum: they will affect the whole world. Hence, we won’t restrict ourselves, and we will bring insights from politics, sociology, philosophy and any other relevant field when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;are-you-schizophrenic-brice-whats-up-with--we-&#34;&gt;Are you schizophrenic Brice? What’s up with « we »?
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe EcoCrypto will grow bigger than myself. Yet, I’m not afraid to carry this project alone as long as necessary. Anyone who recognizes oneself in this manifesto is welcome to join the adventure. The adherence to the manifesto and the quality of the content are the two only required criteria to be able to publish on EcoCrypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ecocrypto-is-part-of-the-new-world-and-held-to-its-standards&#34;&gt;EcoCrypto is part of the new world and held to its standards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youngsters and oldsters alike from all around the world finally have the chance to step up and do their part in a new genesis. We will hold ourselves to the highest standards to ensure we are not steering this blank state back to its greedy roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will enforce the following policies from day one:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;centralized-and-proprietary-services-minimization&#34;&gt;Centralized and Proprietary Services Minimization
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will avoid using proprietary and centralized services as much as possible. Ultimately, our goal is using none. We won’t be using Google Analytics for obvious reasons. We won’t implement that freakin’ Facebook pixel or any other tracking pixel. To still have exploitable stats on our website, we implemented &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://matomo.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matomo (ex Piwit)&lt;/a&gt;, the self-hosted open analytics solution. We will always prefer an open-source solution if available. The blog is currently powered by WordPress and hosted on SiteGround for its first year. Feel free to reach out if you can figure a more privacy-conscious solution covering our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-sympathy-for-the-devils&#34;&gt;No sympathy for the devils
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While EcoCrypto will need awareness at first, we don’t want compromise with our principles. We will allow ourselves one year of presence on centralized social networks to help develop the initial awareness around Ecocrypto. After that date, it will be time for a cleanup. Since EcoCrypto was officially launched today (07/08/2018), all of our social accounts on centralized services will be deleted on the 8th of July 2019. Hell, we’ll make it a party!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;writers-privacy&#34;&gt;Writers Privacy
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclosing your identity is not a requirement to become a writer. Simply send us an email at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;mailto:redaction@ecocrypto.fr&#34; &gt;redaction@ecocrypto.fr&lt;/a&gt; from a disposable email address. As long as the content is sound and follows the principles stated in this document, we really don’t give a fuck about your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;manifestos-accountability&#34;&gt;Manifesto’s Accountability
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any change is made to this document, the previous versions will be kept online and accessible. You will be able to find &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ecocrypto.fr/manifeste/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;all the editions of the manifesto here&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a changelog detailing the main changes and their motivations. Feel free to suggest any solution that could allow us to prove the untempering of the manifesto and that wouldn’t require you to trust us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;our-articles-are-meant-to-spread&#34;&gt;Our articles are meant to spread
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All articles published on EcoCrypto will be translated into English to maximize their availability. If you enjoyed a particular article and would like to translate it into your native language (excluding French, as we cover that already), feel free to do so. Our only condition is that you keep us informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;we-value-your-attention&#34;&gt;We VALUE your attention
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You, readers of EcoCrypto are entrusting us with a highly sensitive material: the time and the attention you give to our articles. We are fully aware of the responsibility it entails. We will be transparent, honest and incorruptible to prove ourselves worthy of your time. We will not mislead you to make you click on our articles. Each story will have to provide a real contribution for it to be published. If you think a given piece of content is not paying its due respect to your attention, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-decentralization-of-ecocrypto&#34;&gt;The Decentralization of EcoCrypto
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the initiator of the project, I, TokenBrice, will have a significant influence over it in its early days. I am fully aware of the centralization vector I represent. EcoCrypto will eventually grow into a decentralized project, but I must first ensure its development and maintain its quality. I will communicate directly on EcoCrypto regarding the steps taken for its decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Demise of Nation States: Introducing the Nation as a Service (NaaS)</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2018 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/demise-ns/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Demise of Nation States: Introducing the Nation as a Service (NaaS)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you believe or not in the idea of “the march of history”, there is an undeniable worldwide trend that is leading to a complete overall of the power structure: &lt;strong&gt;the progressive disengagement of the state from state affairs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this idea is slowly creeping into the public head space, what’s less discussed is what’s next? What happens once the decomposition is over and there is nothing left? That’s precisely what I’ll address today. I will also suggest a framework to consider the role of the state/nation in a post nation-state world: &lt;strong&gt;the Nation as a Service (NaaS)&lt;/strong&gt;. Before we dive in, let us agree on what “decomposition of the nation state” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-long-and-methodical-process&#34;&gt;A LONG AND METHODICAL PROCESS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to determine when the methodical deconstruction of the state started. Like all societal trends, there is no set starting date and each country/region follows it at its own pace. Only one thing is certain: no state can escape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the chronology of the decomposition of a nation state so we might be able to pinpoint the start of the process more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: What follows is merely a tale written to make you question the (shrinking) role of states.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might hurt your political sensibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Feel free to jump straight to the second part of the article — Introducing the Nation as a Service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-break-down-a-nation-state-a-step-by-steptutorial&#34;&gt;How to break down a nation-state? A step by step tutorial
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s go to a fantasy world that will get truer than reality as we depict it&lt;/strong&gt;. After a long a happy reign as king of BBLand (catchy name eh?), I’ve decided I’m done with it. It’s too much of a hassle, I’ve made enough money. How can I let it go? I can’t just shut off the “business”, I still have millions of citizens on my land. I’ll have to go slow. But I’m in luck, I’ve seen the process happening all around me, I just have to replicate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-i-must-destroy-or-sabotage-the-flows-of-information&#34;&gt;First, I must destroy or sabotage the flows of information
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it does flow, people will know what’s happening and might revolt, I can’t chance it. I’ve got many ways to do this, but I think the most efficient is simply &lt;strong&gt;to allow an unprecedented level of concentration in the medias.&lt;/strong&gt; Eventually, I’ll have less than 10 individuals or companies owning them all, and those happy few will promote exactly the same worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my citizens are left with partisan medias. Even better, those medias so concentrated they are easier to manipulate than ever before. &lt;strong&gt;Essentially, what I did is privatizing the attention of my citizens&lt;/strong&gt; — I’m a very modern ruler you see. Just to make sure there are no reliable information anymore, I’ll also make the advertising laws very lax, let lies and false information spread widely, and turn the political life into a TV show. Now we’re talking and by that I mean we’re not anymore, but that was precisely the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;then-i-must-get-rid-of-all-public-institutions&#34;&gt;Then, I must get rid of all public institutions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I can’t do it overnight, I would risk an uprising. I’m gonna &lt;strong&gt;do it insidiously&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with something remote and easy — the prisons. Prisoners have no rights anyway, right? Even if they do, nobody’s gonna check, they’re hidden from the rest of society! It’s the perfect population to get started: low risk, high reward. So let’s privatize, the market will deal with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now I need a hack for the schools, health care, transportation systems and other critical infrastructure. Let’s cut spending. And cut some more. And some more. By the way, have you seen how inefficient the schools and hospitals have become? Shouldn’t we privatize them to make them efficient again? Excuse me?! I’m hearing a no? Cut! Cut! Cut! Is that a yes? See? When you think twice about it you finally see the light, good citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Yes I’m a Frenchie and I am sincerely sorry for the citizens of the states that never knew what a public healthcare service was. You’re simply moving faster than us! Hurray, “progress”!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;now-i-leave-everything-to-themarkets&#34;&gt;Now, I leave everything to the markets
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I finally managed to get rid of public institutions, I want to finish the process, &lt;em&gt;optimize the efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of my country even more. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be some stuff we haven’t thought of selling yet? What about the forests? They can make money! And the beaches? People should pay for them! I’m seeing a free park? Are you out of your mind? Oh! We forgot to privatize the water distribution network? But all my citizens are users, that’s a potential goldmine! Let’s organize a tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and what about our work laws? Citizens are still thinking they entitled to stuff like “unemployment”. I even had a madman the other day who wanted to prosecute a big corporation for not being socially and ecologically responsible — what a lunatic! I’m gonna slash the work laws a dozen times, just to remind them &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tripalium&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;what “work” used to mean: torture&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t even have to go this far, slavery will be enough. But don’t call it like this, no; remember: I’m a progressive ruler. I’m gonna leave them the freedom of choice: would you rather bike for UberEats or Deliveroo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a rest and contemplate: I have markets everywhere, docile citizens with close to no job security and I’m finishing up on the demolition of the last public institutions. I’m getting there, but I feel like I’m missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;finally-from-people-togoods&#34;&gt;Finally, from people to goods
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have a job? Don’t you know that unemployed people are parasites? They bring down the whole society! What am I hearing? You can’t find a job? Oh my dear, you need to learn how to market yourself, develop your personal brand. How else do you expect to be visible in such a competitive job market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, that’s very regrettable. It makes me angry too. Sadly I can’t do anything about it: it’s the market. If I start to promote progressive laws the jobs will go away. Our neighbor CCLand is taxing companies even less than us; we’ll bleed jobs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-when-did-the-deconstruction-of-the-statestart&#34;&gt;So when did the deconstruction of the state start?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure our little trip to BBLand reminded you a thing or two about the real world. But in reality, all four processes are almost concomitant. Only the first one — the decomposition of the medias — seems to be a prerequisite of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more surprising is how this process started to unfold roughly at the same time in the most developed countries: in the mid 70s. That could be a good starting date. But, I’m not here to talk about media concentration, it’s merely an argument to support my thesis. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.osce.org/fom/13870?download=true&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This topic is already covered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;INTRODUCING THE NATION AS A SERVICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to BBland for a minute, what’s left of our state? Barely the minimal business regulatory infrastructure: companies can’t police themselves. Is there anything alike already in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-e-estonia&#34;&gt;Welcome to e-Estonia!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard about the Estonian e-residency before, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;go have a look&lt;/a&gt; you’ll learn a lot. I know most of my dear readers won’t so here is a screenshot from the official website linked above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/demise-ns/e-residency.png&#34;

Screenshot for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Estonian e-residency official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that there are two essential features offered by the e-residency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A government issued global digital ID available to anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not a citizenship, but you’re still &lt;strong&gt;enough of a citizen to own and operate an Estonian-based business&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;strong&gt;close to 30 000&lt;/strong&gt; “digital nomads”  and other entrepreneurs became e-Estonian residents. Yet the e-residency is just a first step. I wanted to learn more about this intriguing and unique e-country, so I went straight to the source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kaspar.korjus?source=post_header_lockup&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Kaspar Korjus, managing director at E-Residency&lt;/a&gt;. Do read any of his article, it gives you an incredible insight on what’s happening. What follows is simply three insightful quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Estionia’s vision for its e-residency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia’s e-Residency programme is also a fast growing startup — albeit a government startup — &lt;/p&gt;
\[…\]
&lt;p&gt;, often with &lt;strong&gt;best practices that we’ve taken straight from the private sector&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-could-offer-estcoins-to-e-residents-a3a5a5d3c894&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Estonia’s potential cryptocurrency, estcoin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Estonia’s perspective, estcoins &lt;/p&gt;
\[Estionia’s cryptocurrency project\]
&lt;p&gt; were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation from more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/happy-3rd-birthday-to-our-global-e-resident-community-7143adc73994&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;return on investment for the e-residency&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte published an independent analysis, which revealed that every euro invested in e-Residency by Estonian taxpayers is projected to return 100 euros to the Estonian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;DEFINING THE NATION AS A SERVICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estionia is the perfect transition. When I hit publish, I might be coining the term “Nation as a Service”. But in reality, &lt;strong&gt;Estonia pioneered the concept, I simply gave it a name&lt;/strong&gt;. Kaspar pretty much defined it when he envisioned &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/what-is-a-nation-children-born-today-will-grow-up-with-a-radically-different-answer-b31f14403c3c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the future world of his three years old son Ruufus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps governments don’t have to ‘tax’ Ruufus by then anyway. **Governments can instead earn their main source of income by selling their services globally in the form of monthly subscriptions **— much like how Netflix currently delivers its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he wasn’t looking at it from my angle, allow me to put words on what I see behind this concept. Here are the four cornerstones of the Nation as a Service (NaaS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of nation state, as we use to know it, becomes obsolete. Regular nations are decomposing or powerless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the void, “digital nations” emerge. They might be tied to real nations (like Estonia), entirely virtual, or even raise money (ICO?) to purchase a land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These digital nations will offer the same services offered by our current nations, on a narrower scope: they will focus mostly on business regulations. Then, the most advanced ones might expand their scope: finance, currency, healthcare, education…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, citizens won’t be tied to a nation by birth anymore. Citizens will compare the offers from different nations and choose their fit. They might have to pay for the service (Estionian e-residency is 100€ one time cost). Nations will compete with one another to attract citizens, and extreme concentration is possible (winner-take-all market). We’ll observe the birth of **“Citizenship portability” **— changing nationality will be easier than changing your internet service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply a proposal, let me know what your think about the concept of Nation as a Service, and feel free to redefine it. Is this a disparition of the state, or just a transition to a new type of state? Probably a little bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here? Since Estonia is the most startupy of all the startup-nations, the development of the NaaS is viewed there with a very positive outlook. And indeed why not? So far it seems to have brought wealth and innovation to Estonia. I am the only one to wonder:  is this wealth really created, or simply taken from other countries’ taxes? We’ll know soon enough: &lt;strong&gt;the rat race has already started&lt;/strong&gt;— &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://ereforms.org/news/estonian_press_wrote_on_unbelievable_azerbaijan-246&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Azerbaijan just joined the party&lt;/a&gt; with its m-residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;final-notes&#34;&gt;Final notes
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;My faithful readers know my strong interest for cryptocurrencies and decentralization, I kept myself in check all along the article so allow me to drift of a little bit now. I see many synergies between the NaaS concept and the blockchain: identity verification, taxes, contracts… Yet despite the synergies, a NaaS is a very centralized institution. I’m puzzled. Could one really help the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I give you your attention back (I privatized it a while ago, it’s mine now, remember?), help me to answer this question: Should I cut the crap and start an ICO to raise capital for the first fully private NaaS? I could be the rattiest rat!&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:15:12 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/growing-beyond-the-advertising-model-to-achieve-democracys-true-potential/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/ad-model/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Growing beyond the advertising model to achieve democracy’s true potential" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we raised many issues about the advertising model and free online services in general. &lt;strong&gt;They all fall within the spectrum of hidden cost, something society, we, eventually pay for.&lt;/strong&gt; From recurring annoyances to a loss of political power, the range of consequences of data concentration for political and social influence is wide. &lt;strong&gt;Behind all of these “free” offers, compromises are made&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many issues with the ad model, all falling under the spectrum of hidden cost. Indeed, behind FB’s “free” offer, a lot of compromises are made, here is a quick overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advertisement-overload&#34;&gt;ADVERTISEMENT OVERLOAD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the online services business model, the (infinite) multiplication of ads inevitable. Indeed, it’s the main way for the actor to maximize their revenues. &lt;strong&gt;They are essentially caught in a profitable and vicious circle&lt;/strong&gt;: More ads -&amp;gt; More views, more views -&amp;gt; more sales, more sales -&amp;gt; more money -&amp;gt; more ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ads are profitable, more and more media space is used to that end. New forms of advertising-content hybrids appeared over the past years, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://techscience.org/a/2015121503/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Native Advertising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;as advertisers are looking for new territory to conquer where the consumer resistance is lower.&lt;/strong&gt; The frontier between a media outlet and a brand outlet is progressively fading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the online side of the industry, the sheer size of the actor should be a cause for concern. &lt;strong&gt;Facebook now as 2bn+ users. That’s more than any government, even China or India can’t compete&lt;/strong&gt;. With this level of mainstream adoption, the reach is virtually unlimited and nobody is out of scope. &lt;strong&gt;To continue to personalize its ads further, Facebook amasses detailed profiles for most individuals, that can then be used to influence them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is the most influential medium for political and social causes. Concentrating so much power in one space is obviously dangerous, as it makes the social discourse more prone to manipulation and coercion. Yet &lt;strong&gt;data is meant to be shared&lt;/strong&gt;, and advertisers are quite generous when it comes to user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;collected-data-areleaking&#34;&gt;COLLECTED DATA ARE LEAKING
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the frequent exchanges between actors in the industry make the data issue widespread and hardly revocable. Whatever the collect point is, the data gathered will eventually be sold to “independent measurement and data company” like Nielsen or Axciom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consumer not only lose control over its data, he also has no knowledge of the usage made of it and who currently owns it&lt;/strong&gt;. Given enough money and resources, anyone could potentially acquire a very detailed file on anybody, including relatives of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profile is often &lt;strong&gt;qualitative enough to let the advertisers and their clients influence opinions, behaviors and ultimately votes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-in-the-state-of-surveillance&#34;&gt;WELCOME IN THE STATE OF SURVEILLANCE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data is not only used for business purposes. Since the beginning of the war on terror, &lt;strong&gt;many western governments got rid of railings limiting the actions of intelligence agencies and surveillance services&lt;/strong&gt;. As monitoring of online services become commonplaces, the novelty now rely on using the data for live facial recognition on surveillance video camera streams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/toolbox&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;toolbox&lt;/a&gt; for crowd and individual control is here. &lt;strong&gt;Even if we ignore what the data gathered allow advertisers and governments to do, this simple act of collection is deeply problematic.&lt;/strong&gt; As the society gain knowledge over this practice, our behavior “normalize”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple awareness of knowing oneself observed will push individuals to modify their behavior in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140209-being-watched-why-thats-good&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;People under scrutiny change their behavior and their choice without even realizing.&lt;/a&gt; Because we know we’re watched, we monitor and censor our own behavior. It doesn’t even have to be a conscious process; we’ll simply tend to match the ideals of the watcher — this is called the observer effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is present in every academic discipline, sometimes with a different name (Hawthorne Effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/ad-model/panopticon.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;panopticon&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation was used by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;philosopher Jeremy Bentham&lt;/a&gt; to envision an institutional building designed for maximum efficiency, the panopticon. Since the watchtower is placed in the center, with prisoners all around, any prisoner can potentially be watched at all times with only one guard. Worse, the prisoners can’t know if they’re being watched or not. He described it himself as &lt;strong&gt;“a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ads-affect-the-very-content-of-the-media-that-hostthem&#34;&gt;ADS AFFECT THE VERY CONTENT OF THE MEDIA THAT HOST THEM
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertisements also affect the media that host them. Some of the effects are quite obvious — such as finding the space for ads (ads break, banner…) but &lt;strong&gt;the most damaging effects are also the less prominent ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, because the content is tied to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/advertisement&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt;, the content creator must follow a &lt;strong&gt;“advertiser-friendly” guideline&lt;/strong&gt;. Media are now competing with one another to host ads, and innovate to attract them: product placement, reality shows… (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=162&amp;amp;v=hr99HzCa0Kg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Publicitarisation — French&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;Everything is becoming a media&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv5WLF6UdZc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Depublicitarisation&lt;/a&gt;). Millions of people are voluntarily following brand accounts on social networks to receive a healthy daily dose of promotion (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZNOCKl-0Mc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hyperpublicitarisation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the free supported by ads model is costly. Advertisers are getting close to the media, restricting what can or cannot be said, topics, and schedules. &lt;strong&gt;Because of ads, diversity and quality of the media are reduced.&lt;/strong&gt; But there is more to it. Once ads are running, &lt;strong&gt;there is a strong incentive to stay compliant with dominant, advertiser-friendly framework&lt;/strong&gt; in order to retain and increase revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meant-to-bebig&#34;&gt;MEANT TO BE BIG
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have seen already, Facebook’s and others main profit driver is &lt;strong&gt;how addicted to their service, to maximize the time spent on it&lt;/strong&gt;. It can’t be balanced, &lt;strong&gt;it’s a design flaw&lt;/strong&gt;. When Zuckerberg speaks about Facebook’s ideals, and how he wishes to make it more honest and transparent, it’s no more than marketing and PR.On a market where two actors (Facebook and Google) hold more than half of the revenue of the whole industry, what can you do if your ad costs explode? Essentially, you have no alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Net digital advertising revenue share of major ad-selling online companies worldwide from 2016 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-edge-ofscale&#34;&gt;THE EDGE OF SCALE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not pleading for breaking down Facebook or Google. The result would eventually be the same a few years down the road. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;because of their business model, the GAFA are meant to be giants&lt;/strong&gt;. Behind the “big data” or whatever name they give to it are basically two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a robust system to collect data on consumers, organize it, tag it, and clean it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling the data after a form a processing (building audience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both those activities benefit hugely from scale&lt;/strong&gt;. For data collection, the bigger you are, the more present you will be which in the end multiply the opportunity to collect new data points. The ideal scenario here would a quasi-monopolistic situation where people can hardly avoid using your service (Hello Zuckie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reselling data, once again size does matter, a lot! &lt;strong&gt;Datasets scale twofold, both in terms of quantity and quality&lt;/strong&gt;. The bigger the dataset, the more people they cover, allowing the data reseller to reach new markets. Simultaneously, each new data point collected on a given individual allows the reseller to charge more, because of the precise targeting and personalization it allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the dataset covers more and more people, new correlations can be found, which in turn increase the amount of information available in any given person present in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it means, in an economic sense, is that &lt;strong&gt;each time Facebook register a new user, it benefits twice from it&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, it will increase its total amount of (active) user, which is the base multiplier of FB’s revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, because a bigger dataset allows drawing more insightful analysis, &lt;strong&gt;FB is able to increase its revenue per user (ARPU)&lt;/strong&gt; more for each data point it already has on one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook’s ARPU, 2015–2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARPU (Average Revenue per User) is an interesting metric to look at. It gives you an idea of &lt;strong&gt;how much money Facebook is actually able to extract from your data.&lt;/strong&gt; The ARPU is also strongly correlated on how detailed the database is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high ARPU could then indicate that Facebook has a very detailed file. With an ARPU of $26+ for the US and “up to 5,000 data points on 220 million Americans”, it seems to match. &lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, the ARPU is an indicator of the extent in which Facebook can be used to influence a population.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the growth of Facebook’s ARPU, it has been on exponential growth over the last four years. Once again, the real word seems to confirm the observation, as the role played by Facebook keep getting more important with each new ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Facebook’s average revenue per user as of 4th quarter 2017, by region (in U.S. dollars)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAFAs are now so big that each of their decisions has huge impacts&lt;/strong&gt;. Google and Facebook together are the biggest source of traffic for most websites. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.legrandsoir.info/un-nouvel-algorithme-de-google-limite-l-acces-aux-sites-web-progressistes-et-de-gauche.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;When Google slashes incoming traffic by 70% to a 20 years old left-leaning website — French&lt;/a&gt;, the World Socialist Web Site, &lt;strong&gt;it is a political action with real consequences on the political life of the country&lt;/strong&gt;. GAFAs are now the gatekeepers of the information online and make calls about what we see or not. Because of their size, their decisions have tremendous impacts on society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know about Facebook and other online services data collection practices, it’s time call the shots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we keep sacrificing our political power on the altar of convenience, or should we build our own decentralized social network services framework to prevent control and manipulation from hostile parties?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain opened a range of new options to build decentralized institutions we can trust. Some solutions are already working. We’ll see radical alternatives emerge over the upcoming years, &lt;strong&gt;it’s up to us to make the best of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/free-services/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Facebook X Cambridge Analytica : the hidden cost of free services" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month was a strange one. We saw mainstream media questioning &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/facebook&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and Cambridge Analytica practices after recent concerns over the US election. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/facebook-week-of-shame-data-breach-observer-revelations-zuckerberg-silence&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; sums it up in one frightening sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had manipulated the voters of democracies across the globe, notably in the US, with unsourced propaganda that was not necessarily true; and boasting of sting operations and honey traps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica took part in the yes for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/brexit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;While Cambridge Analytica was already &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_SlD7D_xug&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;advertising its services on Youtube since August 2015&lt;/a&gt;, they weren’t very secretive about their intent; here’s what they boast about in their promotional videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the American market, they claim to have &lt;strong&gt;“up to 5,000 data points on 220 million Americans”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We go beyond big data, we add an extra layer of personality data to &lt;strong&gt;get down to an individual level”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of Cambridge Analytica and its impact over elections have been well covered, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;such as in The Guardian’s Cambridge Analytica files&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;. Now, even Google will tell you:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s less discussed is how could we even get to this point? Considering the company’s goals and practices, abuses should have been expected and prevented. Let’s broaden the discussion and address the tradeoff made with “free” services instead and the &lt;strong&gt;consequences of this data theft: a loss of political and personal power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-advertising-model-the-necessary-pain&#34;&gt;THE ADVERTISING MODEL: THE NECESSARY PAIN?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a quote from Mark Zuckerberg that got me started on this article. In the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ezra Klein Show&lt;/a&gt; when asked about the &lt;strong&gt;limits of Facebook’s current business model&lt;/strong&gt;, he didn’t exactly answer the question yet provided a fascinating response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not paying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the &lt;strong&gt;only rational model that can support building this service to reach people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presents the advertising-supported model &lt;strong&gt;as the only rational one able to bring free services to the world&lt;/strong&gt;. I would argue instead &lt;strong&gt;it’s only the easiest way&lt;/strong&gt;. Essentially, advertising allows generating revenue out of each/most users of the service. Because of the monetary incentive tied to ads, the provider tends to focus on collecting more data and increasing the user base even further instead of actual development of the service. It can’t be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they restlessly harness data, &lt;strong&gt;online services gain actual power and influence on individuals and societies&lt;/strong&gt;. Facebook is now the kingmaker, or is it already the king? If Facebook is king, it’s a sneaky one: he’s being secretive about its regal nature. They didn’t come public about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, they waited for the public to notice and patiently prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/16/mark-zuckerberg-new-facebook-manifesto-letter&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;In a manifesto written in 2017 about the future of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, he develops a grandiose and frightening vision for the social network, as &lt;strong&gt;“the social infrastructure for the global community”.&lt;/strong&gt; What we’re seeing today is only stage 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Facebook isn’t a lone wolf. There is a whole industry built on similar concepts: online advertising. While Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are probably at fault, many other companies such as Google, Yahoo, or Baidu have similar practices. A whole industry is at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-crookedindustry&#34;&gt;A CROOKED INDUSTRY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advertising industry has always been ripe for abuse and scams, but &lt;strong&gt;digital advertising brought it to another level&lt;/strong&gt;. Abuses are common, both for advertisers and other actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the industry, you uncover several battles being lead all at once. First, &lt;strong&gt;shady practices are rampant in the industry&lt;/strong&gt;. On the advertiser side, botting and click-fraud are massive. To top this all up, users, annoyed by the evermore intrusive ads, are now fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abuses-and-shady-practices&#34;&gt;ABUSES AND SHADY PRACTICES
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abuses and misleading tactics are spread all around the industry on all kind of ads and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, apps and games may have &lt;strong&gt;aggressive data collection practices&lt;/strong&gt;, requiring unnecessary permissions (contacts, pictures, files…), which allow them to collect unnecessary data. Unsurprisingly, the Facebook app is among one of the most demanding in terms of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On desktop, there are intrusive banner ads and pop-ups all around deteriorating the browsing experience on the web. Worst, there are also much more intrusive practices such as &lt;strong&gt;spywares&lt;/strong&gt; (your beloved grandma’s toolbar) &lt;strong&gt;bundled with free softwares&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
A glimpse in toolbars’ hell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If scammy tactics are common for advertisers, brands pay the price for it as automated clicks are hard to distinguish for real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practically-in-a-civilwar&#34;&gt;PRACTICALLY IN A CIVIL WAR
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bots or automated activity is indeed massive in the online advertising world. It’s hard for brands to recognize these practices, and it allows the ad seller to increase their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA, why are they so many bots on Twitter? About 20% of all accounts are bots (fully automated), and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;at least 20% others use automated methods&lt;/a&gt;. So, if Twitter was to take actual measure against automated activity, it would risk losing up to 40% of the impressions it sells to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry itself is well aware of the issue, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/fb66c818-49a4-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;World Federation of Advertiser&lt;/a&gt; estimates that &lt;strong&gt;between 10 to 30% of the slots are never seen by consumers because of fraud&lt;/strong&gt;. The total loss is estimated at $50bn a year, roughly a third of the current online advertising industry yearly revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;users-are-fighting-backtoo&#34;&gt;USERS ARE FIGHTING BACK TOO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the click fraud, you must add another stream of lost revenues for advertisers: users using an ad blocker. To protect themselves, surfers took matters in their own hand and developed Ad-Blockers extension, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-adblocker/gabbbocakeomblphkmmnoamkioajlkfo?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NanoBlock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uBlock origin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering how intrusive and annoying ads have become, it was bound to happen. &lt;strong&gt;While adblockers minimize annoyance on the user side, it doesn’t solve the problem at all at the industry level.&lt;/strong&gt; Because less users now see the ads they host, media advertising revenues dwindle putting their very subsistence at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side, installing a Firefox/Chrome extension come easy for some, many don’t know about them or even about ad blockers. &lt;strong&gt;Only the most tech-savvy users tend to use ad blockers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;the ad industry is fighting back&lt;/strong&gt;, some websites are now blocking access to users with an ad blocker enabled. Luckily, blockers currently have the final world with anti-ad blocker defusers like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Defender&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an ongoing back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising industry is mined by vicious circles of abuse that lead users to fight back. Since it lowers their revenues, media and advertisers are pushed towards even more intrusive advertising and data collection practices to try to break even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole advertising model is unsustainable. &lt;strong&gt;The actual consequences of the development of free services spread all the way down to the individual level. The tributes we pay is already massive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the abuses within the industry, the ongoing war with the users but most importantly &lt;strong&gt;the political clout claimed by online service which now makes them able to coerce public opinion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about Cambridge Analytica, it’s much bigger than this. I share &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/club-max/zuckerberg-in-dc-exposes-how-little-our-governments-understand-where-humanity-is-heading-b568607ab216&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Max Evans views&lt;/a&gt; on Zuckberg’s hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Words will be said, apologies noted, laws passed, but the problems will grow. Companies will not moderate their behaviour totally because they only have to accede to individual nations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the state is unfit to deal with this, &lt;strong&gt;we have but one option left: do something about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising model is not only tendentious but perverse. Is it really the only option Zuck, or just the one that happened to be proposed first and quietly established as a standard? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/growing-beyond-the-advertising-model-to-achieve-democracys-true-potential-5990de48a86f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Other models that allow a fairer distribution of the values between all the actors of the ecosystem exist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-build-a-cryptobot-in-python-able-to-fetch-data-from-external-apis/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/satodemo.gif" alt="Featured image of post How To Build A Cryptobot In Python Able To Fetch Data From External APIs" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatbots have an incredible  potential. Yet, for bots to be efficient, they must integrate and  exchange data with existing services and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to fetch data from external API allows for more complex use case that a simple Q and A logic&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, this ability combined with NLP offers even more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Sato – the cryptobot we’ll be building today, is able to recognize all  cryptocurrencies, even those not even listed yet. I won’t have to do anything for him to be able to process queries on  crypto appearing even years from now, because Sato, deep-down,  understood what a cryptocurrency symbol is  (after being fed with thousands of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-building-today&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ARE WE BUILDING TODAY?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial, we  will have a bot able to fetch data from a third party API depending on  what our users input, and reply to them with the value fetched. Here’s  the end-result of what we’ll build today: a cryptobot aka a chatbot able to fetch any cryptocurrency price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll have by the end of this tutorial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rush? Here is all you need to build your own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap/ahirice/sato-cryptobot/train/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sato&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal today is to build bot able to recognize a question about pricing on any cryptocurrency. Let your imagination flow, &lt;strong&gt;it could be really anything there is involving data available on third party APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in the tutorial, let me give you some information on how Sato works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meet-sato-the-cryptobot&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEET SATO, THE CRYPTOBOT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sato is a bot made to answer basic questions about cryptocurrencies and fetch their prices. Here’s an  overview of what he can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fecth cryptocurrencies prices  (what we’ll build today): Sato recognizes cryptocurrencies symbol  (“ETH”, “BTC”) and fetch their price on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cryptocompare API&lt;/a&gt; to finally return BTC and USD value to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the users’ questions about wallets – online wallets, exchange wallets, cold wallets and hardware wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address questions about private and public keys as well as the security of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Briefly present the main cryptocurrencies, currently BTC, ETH, BCH and LTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inside-sato-cryptobot&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSIDE SATO, CRYPTOBOT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll focus on the skill fetching the crypto prices, as it requires an external API call. Essentially, Sato needs three things to be able to detect a question about crypto price and return the value asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, he needs an intent &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap/ahirice/sato-cryptobot/train/crypto_price?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sato&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;(@crypto_price&lt;/a&gt;) with diverse expressions and cryptocurrencies mentioned, so he can  efficiently recognize these questions. Here are some of the expressions  used to define the @crypto_price intent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/i-crypto-price.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cryptobot @crypto_price expressions&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample of the expressions used to define the @crypto_price intent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, for Sato to be able to recognize all cryptocurrencies, he’ll need the biggest list you can find. I found 1200+ on CoinMarketCap which is good enough to begin with. I created a gazette of the crypto names to improve its understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we’ll need to build a skill which triggers when the @ask_price intent or #crypto_name entity is recognized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/skill1.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cryptobot - triggers&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato – Cryptobot / crypto_main skill triggers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also add #crypto_name as a requirements, to make sure no API called is fired without parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mk0caiblog1h3pefaf7c.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cryptomissing.png&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

		alt=&#34;Sato - Cryptobot / crypto_main skill requirements&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato – Cryptobot / crypto_main skill requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This skill must also call your webhook that we’ll setup below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mk0caiblog1h3pefaf7c.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/webhookcryotio.png&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sato – Cryptobot / crypto_main skill actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to add a memory reset after the webhook trigger, it’s required to clean the memory after each answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll test our bot  straight in Messenger, so you’ll need to create a page and an app and  connect it. Everything is documented in the &lt;code&gt;CONNECT&lt;/code&gt; tab and in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap/blog/build-your-first-bot-with-sap-conversational-ai/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sato&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the getting started tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep it concise**, this tutorial will not detail the creation of a bot**. We’ll start from a functioning bot already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet me there, you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option A: build your own bot (who doesn’t have to be a cryptobot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option B: fork Sato and start from here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap/signup/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sato&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Forking a bot on SAP Conversational AI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-basic-server-code-and-requirements&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II/ BASIC SERVER CODE AND REQUIREMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we want to interact with our bot, we’ll need a server to be able to receive the results of the NLP made by SAP Conversational AI and send our responses back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;bot builder&lt;/a&gt;, go to the &lt;code&gt;CODE&lt;/code&gt; tab to find an example of base code required to start your API. We give examples in Node.JS, PHP, Python and Ruby. This tutorial will be Python only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the base code for Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;replies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;content&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Roger that&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/errors&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take some time to look at the code to get a better understanding of what we’ll be doing: &lt;strong&gt;we’ll build on this code during this tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;. You can save it in your favorite text editor for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIREMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the server script uses the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://flask.pocoo.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Flask as a web framework&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the API call, we’ll also use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s go ahead and install both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;pip install Flask
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;pip install requests
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-test-the-server-ngrok&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III/ TEST THE SERVER: NGROK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the base server,  let’s make it run and test it. It will allow us to be more incremental  in the process so the debugging (if any) is simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expose our local server to the internet, we’ll need ngrok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you are using Windows like me, there is awesome package manager – &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; which works pretty much like apt-get on UNIX. With it, you’ll be able to install ngrok in one line &lt;code&gt;choco install ngrok_portable&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, Chocolatey adds ngrok to your PATH, allowing you to start ngrok from any terminal simply by typing &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to start our server and test it, this implies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a webhook trigger in your bot (detailed in step 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your python script,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose port 5000 to the internet with ngrok: &lt;code&gt;ngrok http 5000&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the forwarding URL form ngrok and past it as your bot base URL on SAP Conversational AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-preparing-the-external-api-call&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV/ PREPARING THE EXTERNAL API CALL&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s about time to start building! Let’s have a look at the api call we’ll be doing to get the price of  any cryptocurrency. Several APIs are available for this purpose so I  just went ahead and picked one: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cryptocompare API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cryptocompare API&lt;/a&gt; offers thousands of possibilities, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll stick with the basics. &lt;strong&gt;We want the price of the matched crypto in BTC, USD and EUR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the call is structured(here for ETH):&lt;code&gt;https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=&amp;quot;ETH&amp;quot;&amp;amp;tsyms=BTC,USD,EUR&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fsym&lt;/code&gt;: the symbol of the cryptocurrency, this is where we’ll need to fetch the crypto_name recognized in the #crypto_name entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsyms&lt;/code&gt;: the currency in which the price will be returned. We chose BTC, USD and EUR here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in our case, we’ll only need to adapt the &lt;code&gt;fsym&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the recognized cryptocurrency, while the rest of the call stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-adapt-the-api-call-to-include-the-symbol-recognized-in-the-user-input&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V/ ADAPT THE API CALL TO INCLUDE THE SYMBOL RECOGNIZED IN THE USER INPUT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to fetch the prices, we need to go back to our server code and upgrade it so it can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the #crypto_name recognized by SAP Conversational AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an API call to Cryptocompare using the #crypto_name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-finding-our-data-in-sap-conversational-ai-json&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/ FINDING OUR DATA IN SAP Conversational AI JSON&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the data returned by SAP Conversational AI on a user input. To do so, you click the &lt;code&gt;CHAT WITH YOUR BOT&lt;/code&gt; button present on all pages, on the bottom-right corner. Then, you can  switch between the conversation and the JSON view by clicking on the  orange information circle as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mk0caiblog1h3pefaf7c.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/priceOMG.png&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/priceOMG.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the JSON of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, our symbol is accessible with &lt;code&gt;[&#39;conversation&#39;][&#39;memory&#39;][&#39;crypto&#39;][&#39;raw&#39;]&lt;/code&gt;. Since the value and the raw and identical in this case, you can use either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our server, the JSON returned by the website test panel is &lt;strong&gt;encapsulated into the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; dictionary&lt;/strong&gt; (see server code). So we need an extra step to retrieve it on our server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;# FETCH THE CRYPTO NAME
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;crypto_name = data[&amp;#39;conversation&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;memory&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;crypto&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;b-make-an-api-call-using-the-recognized-entity&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B/ MAKE AN API CALL USING THE RECOGNIZED ENTITY&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the API call, we’ll be using  Requests. Don’t forget to import it in your server’s script, then, we  build our base request (r):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;import requests
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;r = requests.get(&amp;#34;https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=&amp;#34;+crypto_name+&amp;#34;&amp;amp;tsyms=BTC,USD,EUR&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and print it, but you may be disappointed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/r.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cryptobot - cryptocompare API response&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you want to get the values returned by the call, you need to print &lt;code&gt;r.json()&lt;/code&gt;. The good news is that JSON returned by Cryptocompare is really as simple as it could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/cryptocompare-json.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;cryptobot - JSON from cryptocompare API&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocompare JSON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Now, we just have one last step to figure out: returning the prices to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vi-returning-the-data-fetched-to-the-user&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI/ RETURNING THE DATA FETCHED TO THE USER&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s time to finish our base  server code upgrade: we need to edit the replies returned to include our freshly fetched data. To do so, we’ll edit the message returned by our  server code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;return jsonify( 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    status=200, 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    replies=[{ 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text&amp;#39;, 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &amp;#39;content&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Roger that&amp;#39;, 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    }],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll be editing the replies only, to include the prices we fetched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;   replies=[{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;text&amp;#39;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &amp;#39;content&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;The price of %s is %f BTC and %f USD&amp;#39; % (crypto_name, r.json()[&amp;#39;BTC&amp;#39;], r.json()[&amp;#39;USD&amp;#39;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    }],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the reply is a string, we must use the modulo (%) operator to  include our prices in the string. Here, the first %s tells Python to  look for a string while the two following %f indicates floats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our upgraded server is now finished, here’s the whole code :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/errors&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;POST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;get_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our new server completed, we now have all the pieces of our puzzle. Let’s assemble it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your python script,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose port 5000 to the internet with ngrok: &lt;code&gt;ngrok http 5000&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the forwarding URL form ngrok and past it as your bot base URL on SAP Conversational AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the basics to build a bot able to fetch third party data, what’s gonna be? You show us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Since this tutorial uses ngrok, your computer must be on and ngrok must be running for your bot to function.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, the Python server made in the last tutorial was &lt;strong&gt;self-hosted&lt;/strong&gt;: you had to run it on your own computer, using ngrok to expose one of your ports to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you closed the terminal running the script, or turned off the computer, the server was shut down and  your bot left unable to reply. Hopefully, thanks to services such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; it’ easy to get started with servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cai.tools.sap/blog/python-cryptobot/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the end-result of what we’ll build today: a cryptobot aka a chatbot able to fetch any cryptocurrency price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll have by the end of this tutorial&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you would rather understand how it was made, go through with the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-building-today&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we building today?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re taking &lt;strong&gt;the next step to ensure permanent availability of your bot&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have your bot server hosted on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and always available, 24/24, 7/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies some extra steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting your code on a Github repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifying our server code for Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding extra files to match Heroku’s requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting the Github repo and the Heroku app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test and debug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; is nicely integrated with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; so this is where the code will be hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-github&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I/ GITHUB&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section will focus on using GitHub Bash/CLI (Command Line Interface) to host our code. &lt;strong&gt;You can skip this step all together using the visual interface&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.github.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-git-in-three-lines&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. GIT IN THREE LINES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Github has two major interest for developers: first, it tremendously &lt;strong&gt;facilitates collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;. Secondly, it smoothly handles &lt;strong&gt;file versioning.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if these two advantages may seem remote to you for now, it’s worth it to learn good habits right from the start: GitHub is now a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-getting-gitbash&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. GETTING GITBASH&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/download/win&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;You can get Git Bash from here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In the first tutorial, I mentioned about using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; on Windows for package management. If you did so, you can install Git simply by inputting &lt;code&gt;choco install git&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will it  install Git, but it will also add it to your system’s path, allowing you to call Git from any terminal. Unlike Ngrok, the Git installer can also add Git to your system path so here choosing between the two  installation methods is a matter of preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-identification-global&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. IDENTIFICATION (GLOBAL)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we starting manipulating  files with Git, we’ll need to set up our email and username. They can be set at a global level or at a directory level. For the sake of  simplicity, we’ll set them at a the global level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git config --global user.email &amp;#34;email@example.com&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git config --global user.name &amp;#34;bobby&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can confirm both by using the same command without any value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/gitconfigconfirm.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Verifying username config on GitHub CLI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-directories&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. DIRECTORIES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to open our project directory (locally). There are many ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the CLI, you can move between folders with the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command. You can use tab to autocomplete your input in order to speed up the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/cdtabs.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo - Navigating folders using CLI&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating folders using CLI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to create a new folder, use the &lt;code&gt;mkdir foldername&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also go to your folder using the explorer, and then open a console at the location with SHIFT+Right Click -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Open Powershell Window Here&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our folder, let’s say /git/ for instance, you can add the file you want to push to GitHub in it. For now, let’s push the server file from the previous tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you are in the right directory in your terminal. Here’s where I’m at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/beforegit.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo - Preparing for the push&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for the push&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-first-git-push&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. FIRST GIT PUSH&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A git push has several stages.  First, you add files to the commit. Then, you commit the changes.  Finally, it’s time to push the changes to the remote origin (the GitHub  repo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get started, let’s initialize our local repository (/git/ on my screenshot) as a Git repository: &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, we add the file we wants to push (server.py): &lt;code&gt;git add server.py &lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: you can add all files in your local repository with the following command: &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we commit our changes. To easily keep track of our changes, try to be concise and descriptive in your message:&lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;First server.py commit&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re now almost  ready to push, once we tell GitHub which repository we want to push our  files into. In GitBash language, that’s the ORIGIN:&lt;code&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/Ahirice/sato&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget to replace the origin URL with your own github repo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And verify it:&lt;code&gt;git remote -v &lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your repository URL (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Ahirice/sato&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/Ahirice/sato&lt;/a&gt; for me here) is displayed at the top of the repository Quick Setup  page. If you repository is already published, the repo URL is the URL  you use to access it on GitHub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is set up, now it’s time to finally push: &lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the whole process in a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/gitpush.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo - GitHub push GIF&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub push GIF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! And here went the first push to our GitHub repo, feels good right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/1out5.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Step 1/5 – Hosting the code on a GitHub repo*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-preparing-for-heroku-required-files&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II/ PREPARING FOR HEROKU: REQUIRED FILES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we deploy, we need to add  some files to our repository that Heroku requires. Moreover, we’ll have  to adjust our server.py script slightly to make it work on this new  configuration. Let’s start with the required files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-requirementstxt&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. REQUIREMENTS.TXT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first tutorial, we installed Requests and Flask using pip. For our remote server to work, &lt;strong&gt;it will need these two libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. This is precisely what the requirements.txt file is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Flask==0.12.2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;requests==2.18.4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heroku will process the  requirements.txt and install any library listed here in the virtual  environment used to run your server. The whole process is automatic, you just need to make sure all your script requirements are listed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The state of the art process would have been to create a virtual environment  before we began any coding. Then, when deploying to Heroku, we would  have frozen our virtual environment requirements to populate our  requirements.txt file. For the sake of simplicity, we kept things a  little bit easier than they should be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-procfile&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. PROCFILE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procfile is a  text file that must be in the root directory of your application. It  states the command executed to start your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first tutorial, we started our local server with &lt;code&gt;python server.py&lt;/code&gt;. Here, the command is almost the same. We just need to explicitly state  the process type (web) for Heroku, so here’s what we write in our  Procfile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;web: python server.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-appjson&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. APP.JSON&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app.json file is used to  declare standard information about your application, including: name,  images, addons environment variables… &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku offers a comprehensive resource &lt;/a&gt;explaining how this file is structured, we invite you to check it if you want to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we’ll just use a basic app.json:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Sato crypto bot&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;description&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;The server side for Sato.&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;image&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;heroku/python&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;repository&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;https://github.com/Ahirice/sato&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;keywords&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;python&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;flask&amp;#34; ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;addons&amp;#34;: [ &amp;#34;heroku-postgresql&amp;#34; ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &amp;#34;environments&amp;#34;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &amp;#34;scripts&amp;#34;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;server.py test&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to at least &lt;strong&gt;edit the repository key value to match your own GitHub repo&lt;/strong&gt;. The rest can stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/2out5.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2/5 – Adding Heroku required files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-preparing-for-heroku-python-server-modifications&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III/ PREPARING FOR HEROKU: PYTHON SERVER MODIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our server file need slights adjustments to work on Heroku. You can find both files on the GitHub repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;server.py&lt;/strong&gt; is the server script used on Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;server-self-run.py:&lt;/strong&gt; is the script we used in the first tutorial (and ran ourselves with ngrok)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we just need to modify the port and the host of our app. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-switching-from-port-5000-to-a-port-defined-as-environment-variable&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. SWITCHING FROM PORT 5000 TO A PORT DEFINED AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and the biggest change we have to do is to &lt;strong&gt;modify the port used by our webapp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first tutorial, we hardcoded the port in our script (&lt;code&gt;port = &amp;quot;5000&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; [line6 in server-self-run.py]). This time, &lt;strong&gt;we’ll need to define the port as an environment variable&lt;/strong&gt; (Heroku requirement). Hopefully, this is done in two simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, to access environment variables in Python, we’ll be using the &lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt; function . It means we must import os. [line 4 in server.py].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we need to adapt the line were we define the port: &lt;code&gt;os.environ[&amp;quot;PORT&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; fetch the value of the environment variable named “PORT”: we’re almost there. Since &lt;strong&gt;ports are integers&lt;/strong&gt; (=whole number which can be positive, negative or null), we must ensure the port we fetch is indeed one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/integers.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing the int() function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we encapsulate our query in the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function. Therefore, our port is now defined as it follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;port = int(os.environ[&amp;#34;PATH&amp;#34;])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Although  we have to import os in our script, it’s not needed in the  requirements.txt. Indeed, os is one of the base python library, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sys&lt;/a&gt;: these libraries are available as soon as Python is installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-changing-the-host&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. CHANGING THE HOST&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one last change to do  before our server.py is ready. To expose our flask app to the internet  (so it can accepts connection from remote sources instead of just local  ones), &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#public-server&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;we must set its host as “0.0.0.0.”.&lt;/a&gt; We just need to change the very last line of our script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;app.run(port=port, host=&amp;#34;0.0.0.0&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-pushing-the-new-files-to-our-github-repo&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. PUSHING THE NEW FILES TO OUR GITHUB REPO&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the last two steps, we modified server.py and created requirements.txt, procfile and app.json.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move forward with the fifth and last step of the tutorial, &lt;strong&gt;we need to push these changes to our repo&lt;/strong&gt;. Hopefully, we’re now familiar with GitHub’s process. If you have some  doubts about the process here, please refer to the first step of this  tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the updated and newly created files on our GitHub repo, we are ready to deploy to Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/3out5.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Step 3/5 – Adapting the server script for Heroku*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iv-githeroku&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV/ GIT+HEROKU&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, that we’ve been through the  Git process, it’s time for some good news. Heroku offers an easy and  potent GitHub integration: once your connect the two accounts, &lt;strong&gt;new files pushed on the master repository on GitHub will be automatically deployed to Heroku&lt;/strong&gt; (unless you rather do it manually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If the  CLI grew on you, or you would rather not connect your Github and Heroku  accounts, Heroku also offers a CLI to deploy your servers. It won’t be  covered in this tutorial, so we recommend you check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku’s Getting Started&lt;/a&gt; guide if you want to do it this way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-deployment-on-heroku&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. DEPLOYMENT ON HEROKU&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account creation process on  Heroku as it’s straightforward so we won’t detail it. Once you have you  account, create a new app, and connect to your GitHub account to deploy  it automatically. Just follow the GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/herokudeploy.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo - Deployment options on Heroku&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment options on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once automatic deployment is active, every time you push to your GitHub repo, Heroku will deploy the new files to your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would rather deploy  manually but still benefits from the convenience offered by the  GitHub&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Heroku integration, you can use the Manual Deploy option  (click on the &lt;code&gt;Deploy Branch&lt;/code&gt; button). If you do so, remember to go back on Heroku and click this button every time you update your code. Here’s a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-connecting-your-heroku-app-to-sap-conversational-ai&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. CONNECTING YOUR HEROKU APP TO SAP Conversational AI&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your app is deployed on Heroku, the only thing left to do is to tell SAP Conversational AI where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go on your app on Heroku, on the  settings tab, and scroll down to the Domain and Certificates section.  Under the domain entry, your app endpoint is displayed. Essentially,  it’s your app name (on Heroku) .herokuapp.com. Copy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go back on SAP Conversational AI, in settings, and paste your Heroku app URL in the Bot Base URL field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/4out5.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 4/5 – Push deploy the new server on Heroku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;v-test-and-debug&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V/ TEST AND DEBUG&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, before we go on Messenger to  test our bot, let’s access the logs. They’ll prove helpful if you don’t  get it working right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-accessing-herokus-logs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. ACCESSING HEROKU’S LOGS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have two main ways of accessing Heroku’s logs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Heroku website&lt;/strong&gt;: if you click on the More button, at the top left on Heroku, you can access your server logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From any terminal:&lt;/strong&gt; if you have installed &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Heroku CLI&lt;/a&gt; (available on Chocolatey of course), you can access your logs from any terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the logs in real time with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mk0caiblog1h3pefaf7c.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/commandsato.png&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/commandsato.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/5out5.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;img&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Step 5/5 – Running the server script and accessing the logs*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to the logs, we’ll have all we need to debug in case of a faulty script. Let’s have a look at the common issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-common-issues&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. COMMON ISSUES:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAILING / IN BOT BASE URL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/sato/301.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;github repo - Common issues, trailing /&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors raised by an extra trailing slash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we set up the webhook our bot call as &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, we must make sure the the bot base URL address we pasted does not have an ending /: &lt;code&gt;https://flask-sato-server.herokuapp.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here on the screen, we have a trailing slash in the bot base URL, which leads to a POST request on &lt;code&gt;https://flask-sato-server.herokuapp.com//&lt;/code&gt; unable to be processed triggering a redirect (301) and method not allowed (405) errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO RESPONSE ON SERVER AND NGROK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing happens both on your  server and on ngrok, it means SAP Conversational AI can’t reach it. It’s most certainly due to a typo in the bot base URL, or the complete lack  of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLOW RESPONSE TIME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku put your app to sleep when they’ve been inactive for a while. Hence, the first user  who aks a crypto price after a long downtime might wait a while. You can upgrade your account to avoid this, or make another script to keep your bot server always up. It’s a great follow-up exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, for a start-up and moreover at an early stage, &lt;strong&gt;it’s damn hard&lt;/strong&gt;. I tried a lot of different tools before finding the one I’m happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is known, and well documented online: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Skycrapper Technique&lt;/a&gt; is now commonplace. Yet, I find that jumping from theory to field tests and implementation is probably the toughest step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to spot top organic performing content, you’ll need tools. Some free tools can do, but you’ll find yourself using &lt;strong&gt;dozens of them&lt;/strong&gt; in order to match the possibilities offered on a premium SEO service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was looking for my SEO all-in-one dream tool, I put MozPro and SEMRush to the test for a month since both offer a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;//www.semrush.com/sem/?ref=9864882220&#34; &gt;free trial&lt;/a&gt;. To sum it in one sentence, the difference between the two lies in the &lt;strong&gt;accessibility versus exhaustivity dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;. While MozPro is easy to on board, SEMRush can be intimidating; yet it offers more features and add new ones at an impressive rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEMRush was particularly useful to track the results of your SEO efforts, be it search position or backlinks. Its usefulness doesn’t stop here as you can use SEMRush on any domain. &lt;strong&gt;Looking at competitors’ metrics&lt;/strong&gt; helps to discover opportunities and to &lt;strong&gt;confirm hunches you may have on potential strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true value of SEMRush to me lies in two things. First, it does in one single tool what would require 15+ free tools. Also, the data given by free tools won’t be as &lt;strong&gt;detailed, precise, and easy to access&lt;/strong&gt;. Second, the depth and the scope of the data provided is arguably unmatched by other paid services and nonexistent in free services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dig into the Rolls Royce, &lt;strong&gt;let’s see how far some free tools can get you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free SEO tools and services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of tools, web-services, chrome extensions and such made for SEO and Content is overwhelming. The following tools list is just &lt;strong&gt;a partial, and ultimately biased selection&lt;/strong&gt; that should help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The essentials toolbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Google Trends Correlate&lt;/a&gt; — Find keywords correlated to yours. Here are two Google Trends I like to use to showcase the potent of the tool: queries on “running”, “fitness” and “diet” (with the New Year’s Eve impact) and queries on “gift” and “present” (with Christmas’ impact).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Trends is one of the most basic tool there is, yet it can give you invaluable insights. &lt;strong&gt;Trends are strongly correlated with the real world&lt;/strong&gt; and now used for literally anything such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://qz.com/1052656/bitcoin-price-google-trends-can-help-you-figure-where-bitcoins-price-is-headed/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a last one with Hillary vs Trump over the last 9 months of the campaign. Ignoring the massive spike on the Election Day, Trump was consistently generating more volume that Hillary months before the election. &lt;strong&gt;Even if the election was a surprise to most, the data doesn’t lie: it clearly hinted a Trump victory for a long-time before he was elected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEMRush insights’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this article, I’ll show what kind of insights a premium tool can land. The insights presented below were gathered using SEMRush ($99/m) during the &lt;strong&gt;March-April 2017 period&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEMRush works as an “SEO search engine”. In the top bar, you can input any domains (yours or competition’s) and get precise metrics on it including backlinks, top keywords, paid vs organic distribution… Here’s how it looks like on a sample domain query (twilio.com):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/seo-tools/domain-overview.png&#34;

&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;domain overview&lt;/strong&gt; include metrics about backlinks, their types, anchors… Every entry is accessible in a dedicated and exportable full report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/img/2017/seo-tools/backlinks.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;You can also search keywords. The overview tab will give you data about organic and paid volumes, search results and copies. Two other tabs are dedicated to keywords: phrase match and related keywords. &lt;strong&gt;The amount if data available on any keyword is really vast, this where SEMRush shines; as long as the search volume is sufficient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the tools provided by SEMRush let you conduct true &lt;strong&gt;surveys of your competitors’ digital activities and estimate the success of their strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a quick overview of the insights gathered during the first round of competitor’s analysis for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CALLR,&lt;/a&gt; a voice and SMS API and SIP Trunking provider (03–28–2017) using SEMRush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A voice and SMS API essentially allows computers to interact directly with phone networks. Services such as Twilio’s, CALLR’s, or Nexmo’s are behind the text messages you get to confirm your authentication on websites (2FA), the notification texts you can get from services such as Uber or Amazon, etc. and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://customers.twilio.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;many other use cases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;involving automated phone calls and text messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 12% of Twilio’s organic traffic comes from a single article&lt;/strong&gt;, not strongly related to their expertise. Indeed, it’s a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tutorial detailing how to handle (read and write) Google Sheets with Python&lt;/a&gt;. 12% of Twilio’s organic entries is around 15K monthly sessions according to SEMRush. It could be surprising but it makes sense: people using Voice/SMS APIs find themselves interacting with huge sheets quite often, contact lists for instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 10% of Sinch’s organic traffic come from keywords related (or matching) &lt;strong&gt;flash call&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the business use case they put forward. ~38% of their organic traffic lands on their tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still on Sinch, &lt;strong&gt;41/500 of their top queries were due to an extensive tutorial&lt;/strong&gt; (with 700+ comments) on how to build a messaging app on Android. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sinch.com/tutorials/android-messaging-tutorial-using-sinch-and-parse&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Now the page returns a 404&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nexmo’s present a sensibly different organic traffic profile than the rest of the competition. While most providers get the bulk of their organic search traffic from brand or even exact query, &lt;strong&gt;Nexmo’s top entry points are their products pages&lt;/strong&gt;, especially the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nexmo.com/products/sms&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SMS page&lt;/a&gt; (25% of organic sessions) and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nexmo.com/products/chat&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chat app page&lt;/a&gt; (another 12%). At CALLR, we studied them extensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American competitor CallFire is deploying &lt;strong&gt;a smart strategy to increase their organic presence&lt;/strong&gt;. They have seemingly auto-generated page to match every US area code. A large part of their traffic comes from people looking for “XXX area code”. Conversion on this traffic must be low though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, SEMRush helps you find an already field-tested, working strategy used by your competitors. While your chances of achieving the same success by purely replicating them are slim, it gives you an idea of what works in the industry and what people are looking for. &lt;strong&gt;Just as a note, it’s the first time I share this unexploited list, and even though the tips are 6 months old, they might still be valid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the list above, the first one I would address would be Sinch 404’s as it’s the most straightforward: your job would be to &lt;strong&gt;produce a tutorial on the same topic&lt;/strong&gt;, better than Sinch, and then reach out to all those who still links to Sinch’s 404 to offer your own tutorial instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the page is now a 404, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160408195857/https://www.sinch.com/tutorials/android-messaging-tutorial-using-sinch-and-parse/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;using the Internet Archive you can still access the original tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to see what you’ll have to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can try both SEMRush and MozPro for free to make up your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://moz.com/products/pro&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MozPro&lt;/a&gt; offers a free one month trial and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.semrush.com/sem/?ref=9864882220&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;you can get a free trial of SEMRush&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://buzzsumo.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BuzzSumo&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;social analytics and monitoring tool.&lt;/strong&gt; Before I dig in, it’s time for a disclaimer. BuzzSumo is $99/month with a 14-days free trial. Because of the price, I decided to opt out of it, but I did use it for the duration of the free trial. It helped me get a better understanding of the dynamics in my industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering my limited experience with the tool, I won’t go into too much depths. If you’re considering paying for BuzzSumo and using it extensively, I recommend you to read these comprehensive resources: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://raelyntan.com/buzzsumo-tutorial/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;BuzzSumo’s team itself densely document its product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can search for topics or keywords and see the most shared (social) content. You can go even further and see, for any given post, &lt;strong&gt;the accounts who shared it allowing you to understand how each post got&lt;/strong&gt; its reach. This is also particularly useful is you are publishing similar content: it gives you a list of people potentially interested in sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;

The results of a search on BuzzSumo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the BuzzSumo trial in February, to find the top-content addressing VoIP, SIP, and telco APIs. Back then, I recently joined CALLR and was in a reading spree to get a better hang of the main themes to address. Thanks to BuzzSumo, I &lt;strong&gt;compiled a list of the top-performing content&lt;/strong&gt; of the industry. I sorted them according to varied factors: topics, quality of content, approach, tone, targeted audience… Then, looking at sharers, I tried to &lt;strong&gt;correlate these factors to the article’s performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzSumo’s main strength is that it’s a &lt;strong&gt;must-have tool if you want to use the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;skyscraper technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It facilitates the process of finding people potentially interested by your content. Indeed, BuzzSumo’s main strength is that it lets you see the list of sharers of a given content.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Preview of the sharer list feature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet, the metrics it gives you can be hard to interpret&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, in the telco industry I found basic heavily-shared 500–1000 words articles, sometime even just basic product pages from competitors, not particularly qualitative. The gist? Most of these shares are on LinkedIn, and it turns out &lt;strong&gt;a lot of these shares comes from the company’s own employees.&lt;/strong&gt; If a 2000+ employees company manage to get them to share their own content, it can really skew the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice with BuzzSumo is to &lt;strong&gt;dig deeper.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t stop at what BuzzSumo gives you. This is also part of the reason I decided to not subscribe to it: it facilitates the research of content performing on social and influencers, but &lt;strong&gt;it’s not sufficient by itself&lt;/strong&gt; as it relies on indicators that are easily fooled (shares, likes and such are easily bought or automated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From theory to practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the most actionable insights are sadly gated behind heavily priced tools. While BuzzSumo has its flaws due to the shaky nature of social media, it can prove itself useful from a company investing on social medias. On the other hand, a SEO/SEM tool seems to be a must have for any business in for the long-haul, looking to build a &lt;strong&gt;durable online presence&lt;/strong&gt;. Whatever tool you choose, you’re essentially looking for two major benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/ Ability to fetch SEO and SEM data on your competitors / partners / any 3rd party website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/ Greater tracking capabilities of your own and competitors domains metrics and content performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just looking to &lt;strong&gt;facilitate your tracking efforts,&lt;/strong&gt; there are some tools cheaper than SEMRush or MozPro. For simple keyword position tracking, check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.serplab.co.uk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SERPLAB&lt;/a&gt; offering free version with the paid version starting at $5/m. For backlink tracking, check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkody.com/en/plans&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Linkody&lt;/a&gt; starting at 13€/m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are serious about building a long-lasting web presence, you’ll eventually need one of the shiny big tools. Good luck finding your dream SEO toolbox, I’m still constantly tweaking mine!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2017/reddit/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Reddit and Reddit Ads Hitchhiker’s Guide" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I realized most content and marketing materials focused on the main social networks — Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram, leaving little to no room to the countless other services used around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last gig, I explored content promotion and marketing using “alternatives sources”. Indeed, platforms such as Reddit, Quora, Medium, Hackernews or directories helped us tremendously to &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.callr.com/blog/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;our blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;visible to new audiences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Alexa, Reddit is now the &lt;strong&gt;eighth most visited website in the world&lt;/strong&gt;, and the fourth in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

Reddit is the #8 top visited website in the world, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;according to Alexa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more interesting is the progressive internationalization of Reddit: in its early days, most of the website’s visitors were Americans. Nowadays, even if the &lt;strong&gt;English-speaking world still makes for roughly 3/4 of Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;, thriving national communities developed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, massive social platforms such as Reddit emerged over the last few years and while some marketers notice, &lt;strong&gt;most stayed in the old playground&lt;/strong&gt;. Worse, a fair share of those who noticed the popularity on Reddit are &lt;strong&gt;aggressively trying to game it for their own benefits&lt;/strong&gt;, with bots and other dubious methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore the shady side of marketing on Reddit in the last section — Corporate Shilling on Reddit. Before that, I would love to share my own experience with Reddit, to give a feedback on the network as a content promotion platform both organically and with ads as well as share the lessons I learned and the tools I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep it as concise as possible, but Reddit is a whole world: expect quite a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;organic-posting-onreddit&#34;&gt;Organic Posting on Reddit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-isreddit&#34;&gt;What is Reddit?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was an avid Redditor before starting &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.callr.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my last gig at CALLR&lt;/a&gt;, and it helped tremendously. With a healthy daily dose of Reddit comes an &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic knowledge of the rules and expectations of its users&lt;/strong&gt; that helped us understand what the community liked and disliked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working in a startup or in tech, ask around in your company, chances are some of your developers are on Reddit and could help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other organic channels, which offer targeting options only through their ads platform, &lt;strong&gt;Reddit “organic targeting” is precise&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, to put it simply &lt;strong&gt;Reddit is like a huge board&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/all/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/All&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;of boards&lt;/strong&gt; (subreddits). Any user can create a subreddit to discuss the topic of his choice. Some subreddits grow big and are heavily moderated (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/Technology&lt;/a&gt; for instance). Others are more niche and stay small with dynamic and qualitative discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/r/All is the global frontpage of Reddit. When he user connects to the website, he/she lands in his personal frontpage: a page made of the best posts taken from all the subreddit he/she has subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;posting-onreddit&#34;&gt;Posting on Reddit
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a brand, it’s hard to be visible on Reddit organically&lt;/strong&gt;. If you create a brand-named account, users might perceive your post as intrusive. Moreover, a lot of subreddits have restrictions on the type of links you can submit: links to brand blogs are quite often prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find sizable audience on Reddit, &lt;strong&gt;you must frame your content a certain way.&lt;/strong&gt; Redditors are very attached to the community: if you want to fit in, you need to respect this attachment and contribute. Two types of submission are possible on Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link Post:&lt;/strong&gt; they include an URL and a title. On the frontpage, the title will be displayed and if the user clicks it, he’ll get to the page linked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Post:&lt;/strong&gt; they include a title and a body text. &lt;strong&gt;The text itself can include links.&lt;/strong&gt; On the frontpage, if a user clicks a text post, he stays on Reddit and sees the body of the post as well as the comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-link-vs-textstruggle&#34;&gt;The link vs text struggle
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We quickly realized one thing that helped us step up our Reddit game: link-posts are very hard to get right, while &lt;strong&gt;text posts are received with more benevolence&lt;/strong&gt;. With the body text, you can explain what your post is about and provide a summary of it. &lt;strong&gt;It can include a link to your blog post&lt;/strong&gt; so Redditors who want to know more about your topic can find the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text posts were essential to our success on Reddit.&lt;/strong&gt; We understood the value of it with our first text post that got a moderately positive reception. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/6bowht/built_my_own_apartment_search_bot_with_python/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;One of our most successful text post&lt;/a&gt; was made by one of our developers. He had just published a DIY bot tutorial on our blog and then presented it in a Reddit text-post in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/LearnPython subreddit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link posts are not to avoid altogether though. Indeed, if you find a good subreddit/blog post fit, it’s worth trying. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget to check the sidebar of the subreddit your posting on before publishing&lt;/strong&gt;: rules vary per subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s activity is “spikey”: if you manage to create a successful post, it might stay on the top of its subreddit for a day or two. Yet, if you want to keep it qualitative, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll avoid publishing too often&lt;/strong&gt; as it may feel like spam to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your post is tremendously successful, &lt;strong&gt;it might reach the frontpage or even /r/All where the volumes generated are an order of magnitude higher.&lt;/strong&gt; Since our topics are mostly niche, we never reached /r/All yet we consistently generated at least &lt;strong&gt;2000 sessions/month from Reddit since May&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reddit-ads&#34;&gt;Reddit Ads
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit Ads is the platform on which you can find &lt;strong&gt;an unbeatable CPC (Cost Per Click)&lt;/strong&gt; with very precise targeting**.** I’ve already explained the subreddits system in the organic section, so the Ads part is straightforward. &lt;strong&gt;You pay to get your message occasionally displayed at the top the subreddits of your choice&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means displayed to users without ad blockers. Stats estimate &lt;strong&gt;AdBlocker usage around 20% for Europe/US.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the average Redditor is much more tech-savy than the general population, I wouldn’t be surprised if the number jumps closer to &lt;strong&gt;40% on Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;. Hopefully, you only pay for displayed ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any other ad platform, Reddit lets you set different creatives for the same campaigns. As it turns out, &lt;strong&gt;difference of CTR (Click-Through-Rate)and CPC between creatives can be huge&lt;/strong&gt;, anywhere between 2–4x. So far, we’ve lead three campaigns on Reddit. While the first, being a test run was far from optimized, the metrics from the following two are really encouraging. We’ll go back on each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first Reddit Ads Campaign: What’s an API?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first campaign targeted &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/tech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/learnprogramming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/webdev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/technology&lt;/a&gt; with our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com/blog/what-is-an-api/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;What’s an API article&lt;/a&gt;? As you can see, targeting was not the smartest: /r/webdev is a community for developers who probably already know what an API is. Here are the results we obtained, with an average CPC at $0.60.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Results of the ‘What’s an API?’ Reddit Ads campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite sub-par targeting, this campaign helped me familiarize myself with the platform. Once Davy’s House Hunter bot article was out, I now it was our time to shine on Reddit Ads. I also quickly realized that 4 creatives was far from enough to reach decent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second run: House Hunter Bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this campaign, Davy published his &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com/blog/python-house-hunter-bot/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;House Hunter Bot article&lt;/a&gt; and the organic Reddit post was quite a success. Considering the &lt;strong&gt;potential of the content,&lt;/strong&gt; we decided to boost it with Reddit Ads &lt;strong&gt;targeted at Python developers and learning communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Here is the initial targeting: /r/learnprogramming, /r/Python, /r/LearnPython, /r/Programming and /r/Flask. We added /r/webdev and /r/coolgithubprojects later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the large differences we observed between all the four creatives on our first campaign, we went with &lt;strong&gt;12 different creatives this time&lt;/strong&gt;, to progressively weed out the worst performer. On the following screen, 5 creatives with the lowest CTR/highest CPC were already deleted:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Results of House Hunter Bot Reddit Ads campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPC improved tremendously, sitting at a $0.14 average at the end of the campaign. &lt;strong&gt;It ran for a month and half and suffered from ad-fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;: over the first two weeks, the total average CPC was as low as $ 0.10 and CTR &amp;gt; 0.20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the traffic, the campaign landed over 10 business lead and a few newsletter signups. Compared with the cost of a lead from AdWords, &lt;strong&gt;the ROI of this campaign was promising&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third try: Nested Symbols on Sketch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads us to our third and latest campaign. Once again, we wanted to bank on an organic success. With the reach of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com/blog/how-i-streamlined-my-design-process-with-a-few-nested-symbols-on-sketch/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;our Sketch post&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to give it a try on Reddit as designer communities are dynamic. The targeting was the following: /r/SketchApp, /r/design, /r/web_design, /r/userexperience, /r/userexperiencedesign, /r/graphic_design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips-to-redditsmart&#34;&gt;Tips to Reddit smart
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-finding-subreddits-relevant-to-your-content-with-a-dynamic-community&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Finding subreddits relevant to your content with a dynamic community&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding relevant subreddits is crucial for both your organic and promotional activity on Reddit. A minimal amount of activity is necessary for a subreddit to be able to receive advertising. Using Google Sheets IMPORTXML function, we &lt;strong&gt;produced this sheet to fetch automatically the number of subscribers of any given subreddit and determine if ads are available or not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find it here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1HHpUhkaqE8hiC7Es63pBn2n2ex04rScoCrySR2X5s/edit?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Subreddits list and activity Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; — everything is automated, you just need to fill the name of the subreddit in column B (exact spelling) and let the magic happens. The second tab is what I use to track the results from all organic reddit posts in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheet will help you gauge the activity of any given subreddit but finding the subs itself can be tricky. Yes, Reddit has a search engine, but it’s notoriously bad. Here are the tools/services I used to find our subreddits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Search “site:reddit.com some topic”.&lt;/strong&gt; The “site:” syntax allows you to restrict a google search to a single website. It’s neat in this case, as Google is (sadly) a much more efficient way to search Reddit than Reddit’s built-in search engine. Exploring the first results pages with this method will land you the biggest subreddits related to any topics. &lt;strong&gt;To find smaller subreddits using Google, you can use the “-” exclude parameter&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, to find subreddits other than /r/Chatbots on the same topic, the query would be:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“site:reddit.com -reddit.com/r/chatbots chatbot”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &gt;/r/Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branching out from known subreddits:&lt;/strong&gt; this technique is useful to find more subreddits relevant to your niche once you have already found the biggest ones. &lt;strong&gt;Most subreddit include a list of related subreddits in their sidebar, check it!&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind that each subreddit has its own moderator and might not list related subreddits in the sidebar. See on the left a snapshot of /r/Design Sidebar, listing design related subreddits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subbredit search websites:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding subreddit is a struggle, not only for marketers. Numerous services now exist, including: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://metareddit.com/reddits/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MetaReddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://snoopsnoo.com/subreddits/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;SubRedditExplorer&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subreddits to help you find subreddits&lt;/strong&gt;: yes, you read it right. Check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/findareddit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/Subredditoftheday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;The syntax&lt;/a&gt; is straightforward. You can also use a text editor or an online editor. I personally use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dillinger.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dillinger&lt;/a&gt; which displays the markdown and the preview side by side, with the words and characters which is basically all I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like organic Reddit posts, &lt;strong&gt;promotional posts can be texts or link&lt;/strong&gt;. Both looks the same on Reddit, only the action on click changes: text post takes you to the Reddit thread, with your text and the comments while link post takes you straight to the linked page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike organic Reddit posts, we’ve seen performing creatives both as link or text post. Below is the preview of how an ad looks like on Reddit. This one is &lt;strong&gt;our top performer for the campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, with a &lt;strong&gt;$0.12 CPC and 0.210% CTR.&lt;/strong&gt; The text is a slightly edited version of the one used in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/6bowht/built_my_own_apartment_search_bot_with_python/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, apart from the subreddits targeting we already presented, you need to decide on a bid (maximum price for 1000 impressions, from $0.20 to $100) and a budget for the campaign. It’s straightforward and &lt;strong&gt;people used to advertise on other platforms will quickly find their marks.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also target by interest, exclude specific subreddits, day/time or platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-organic-reddit-vs-redditads&#34;&gt;5. Organic Reddit vs Reddit Ads
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to decide what is the best fit for each post: organic Reddit or Reddit Ads? Here are a few rules I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am promoting a &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; (= an article that actually provides value), I will try posting it &lt;strong&gt;organically&lt;/strong&gt; on relevant subreddits. If the organic post is successful, I might consider starting an Ad campaign a few days after the post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If what I am promoting is not a content, but for instance it’s a &lt;strong&gt;product presentation page&lt;/strong&gt; or a new product announcement, I go &lt;strong&gt;straight with Reddit Ads&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, your chances of getting traction with a promotional material are close to none organically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An organic Reddit post can be the perfect way to test Reddit’s appetite for a topic or a type of content&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are planning to do large scale campaigns on your content (&amp;gt;$100/$150), I recommend you try an organic post first. It will help you figure out performing creatives for your Ads campaign later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-trackingresults&#34;&gt;6. Tracking results
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we conclude with a brief overview of corporate shilling on Reddit, I thought it would be useful to address the question of &lt;strong&gt;link tacking on Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;. I won’t got into the details of UTM codes, Buffer produced a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.bufferapp.com/utm-guide&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;very comprehensive guide already.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While link tracking is a reflex for most marketers, it can be dangerous on Reddit. UTM codes are immensely useful yet &lt;strong&gt;they are visible&lt;/strong&gt;: some subreddits remove any submissions with UTM. In my experience, it’s safer to &lt;strong&gt;completely avoid using link tracking for Reddit organic posts&lt;/strong&gt;. With Google Analytics, you will have enough data anyways to understand your traffic from Reddit anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Reddit Ads though, of course tracking codes are not an issue. Moreover, Reddit &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/comments/6x1wj9/announcing_the_release_of_the_reddit_conversion/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;recently announced the release of its tracking pixel&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/advertising-101/installing-reddit-conversion-pixel&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;guide on how to install and use it&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t lead a campaign since the release of the pixel, but since it facilitates the tracking of conversion made from Reddit, it seems to be worth considering for anyone advertising on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;corporate-shilling-onreddit&#34;&gt;Corporate Shilling on Reddit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the article, I mentioned the aggressive behaviors of certain brands who try to game Reddit’s mechanics for their own profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual behavior on the platform, &lt;strong&gt;it translates into bots, vote manipulation and obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s dig into a specific event to make the big picture clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-macdonalds-incident&#34;&gt;The MacDonald’s Incident
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, a post appeared on /r/Gaming, entitled &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/6qmc68/made_my_delivery_drivers_night_by_showing_him_vr/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Made my delivery driver’s night by showing him VR for the first time”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was a picture, displayed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
The picture used for MacDonald’s con act on Reddit, to announce the delivery of their burgers on Uber Eats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things are suspicious, and Reddit was quick to notice. Here are the main flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall disposition seems unnatural, the food is placed at the forefront, with the burger in the hands of the OP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever met anyone having McDonald’s + Wine night?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottle in the middle of the table is red wine while the glasses contain white wine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole bottle of wine and three glasses for a lady presumably eating alone — it was a fun night!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The delivery bag left on the table as a way to broadcast the availability of McDonald’s on UberEats, the goal of this ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole “white girl eating food kindly delivered by his nice black Uber driver who she introduced to a new tech” has a dangerous … lack of taste to it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the reactions were unanimous, &lt;strong&gt;the post still reached the frontpage&lt;/strong&gt; — the whole operation is probably seen as successful for MacDonald’s. Indeed, in the early hours of the post, the masquerade was still uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first comment chains read like an ad script. Are they from real users, bots or fake accounts? Probably an &lt;strong&gt;unhealthy mix of all three&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;/r/HailCorporate&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, MacDonald’s strategy relied on three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding a way to frame their ad that would resonate with /r/Gaming — here they used VR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a fake/bought/rented account to post it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying upvotes or using fake and bot accounts to upvote the post to the frontpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using bots and fake/bought/rented accounts to submit and upvote comments that were in accordance with MacDonald’s message, in order to keep control over the discussion (and &lt;strong&gt;downvote contradicting comments&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined actions allowed them to have a lot of control over the post and its most visible comments. Yet, even if they managed to reach the frontpage, &lt;strong&gt;the Reddit community was also quick to react&lt;/strong&gt;. The comment now at the top of the post is denouncing the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

The first comment (10/07/2017) on the MacDonald’s post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reddits-corporate-shilling-watchdogs&#34;&gt;Reddit’s corporate shilling watchdogs
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate Shilling got so bad on Reddit, a subreddit emerged to denounce it: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/HailCorporate/&lt;/a&gt;. Here is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/6qmc68/made_my_delivery_drivers_night_by_showing_him_vr/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the post on /r/HailCorporate addressing the MacDonald’s ad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is sadly only beginning. At the same time of the MacDonald’s shadow-ad, &lt;strong&gt;a regular Redditor proved you can buy your way to the frontpage&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6osp4h/guy_buys_upvotes_on_rvideos_gets_to_front_page/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;He published a video&lt;/a&gt; in which he explained how he did it: buying upvotes. In his own words, “it wasn’t event that much money”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video indeed reached the frontpage showcasing the Redditor explaining Reddit’s flaws. His cat makes an appearance. Yet, it’s hard to know if its because of the upvotes he bought or because Redditors who stumbled upon the video upvoted it as a way to denounce corporate shilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the &lt;strong&gt;upvotes he bought at least helped him give hist post the initial traction&lt;/strong&gt; it needed to reach the frontpage, which is already more than enough to skew Reddit’s natural behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-does-reddit-go-fromhere&#34;&gt;Where does Reddit go from here?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/reddit/snoo.png&#34;

&gt;
Snoo, Reddit’s mascot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is far from fixed, as a dumb Google search such as “Reddit buy upvotes” gives you countless of options to chose from. I’m sure the admins are working hard to detect and prevent abuses, but considering the scope of the issue and the stakes, it’s gonna take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main reason that motivated me to write this post. I wanted to give to anyone, my feedback and tools to harness the power of Reddit — without falling into the dark side of it. Reddit can generates fascinating discussions and his the home of numerous and dynamic communities built around anything from video games ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://redditmetrics.com/r/gaming&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/gaming&lt;/a&gt; — #9 top subreddit), cute animals ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://redditmetrics.com/r/aww&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/aww&lt;/a&gt; — #12), philosophy ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://redditmetrics.com/r/philosophy&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/philosophy&lt;/a&gt; — #44) to make-up ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://redditmetrics.com/r/MakeupAddiction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;/r/MakeupAddiction&lt;/a&gt; — #183).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of an concept that fit sadly well to this discussion: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;the tragedy of the commons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when a marketer find a channel that performs well for his brand, **his first reaction will be to milk it dry **— try to harness the maximum of attention he could get from this channel (hello MacDonald’s). And it’s understandable, who wouldn’t bank on a success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, doing so quite often &lt;strong&gt;comes at the cost of the channel fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;— the channel progressively become a flavorless advertising medium instead of what it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you consider both the long-term and macro perspective, there is but one option left which is more profitable in the long run, both for the marketer and for the channel: &lt;strong&gt;try to develop the channel as you grow on it&lt;/strong&gt;. It means taking your time, respecting the channel, learning about its customs and of course, when you’re ready, adding you contribution to it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Chatbot Masquerade: Crafting a personality with NLP and grammar</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-chatbot-masquerade-crafting-a-personality-with-nlp-and-grammar/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:43:42 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-chatbot-masquerade-crafting-a-personality-with-nlp-and-grammar/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2017/chatbot-masquerade/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Chatbot Masquerade: Crafting a personality with NLP and grammar" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are chatbots living up to their promises?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is complicated. While on the technical side bot-building frameworks, services, and libraries keep getting better, &lt;strong&gt;chatbots’ ability to understand their users and express themselves needs to be more refined for mass adoption&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s dig in to figure out the underlying challenges of natural language processing and achieving a natural-like expression. The chatbot industry is now worth millions (billions?), yet do you use chatbots daily? Do you know any friends that do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in to figure out the underlying challenges of natural language processing and achieving a natural-like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we do so, let’s state what’s on the menu. We’ll go back to the roots of chatbots, looking at what NLP really is and why it’s so hard. Then, we’ll look at currently available chatbots and analyze their shortcomings. With all this stated, we’ll be able to go back to the linguistics side of it and understand what is required to achieve a genuinely natural like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, loyal readers who stuck with me until the end can go a little further with the transcript of a quick exchange I had with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Suitpossum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brett Scott&lt;/a&gt; while researching this article: we discuss the darker sides of chatbots — automation, speaker obfuscation, and data harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mainly two ways to build a chatbot: rule-based bots and chatbots relying on Artificial Intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule-based chatbots:&lt;/strong&gt; these are the simplest — &lt;strong&gt;if the user says A, the bot will say B&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, a weather bot will respond back with the weather in Los Angeles to the query “weather + LA.” Rules can have some flexibility built-in, to work correctly even if the user inputs the command with a typo for instance. However, the bot will not be able to process an unknown query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based chatbot:&lt;/strong&gt; this approach is entirely different. These bots can analyze the language of the user to extract meaning out of it and answer accordingly — they can &lt;strong&gt;process an unknown input&lt;/strong&gt;. To do so, AI-based chatbots use a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy seems too nice to be true? It’s because it is! Chatbots in the wild are quite often made of a &lt;strong&gt;mix of both approaches&lt;/strong&gt;: they follow a complex decision-tree logic and use NLP to &lt;strong&gt;make unknown statements fall back into one of the branches&lt;/strong&gt; of their tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree logic is straightforward so we won’t detail it in in-depth. What’s more interesting is Natural Language Processing. Besides, it’s not only a bot matter: &lt;strong&gt;NLP powers all form of automated language recognition&lt;/strong&gt;, ranging from sorting through a pile of resume to sentiment analysis on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-the-key-to-smartchatbots&#34;&gt;Natural language processing: the key to smart chatbots
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural language processing (NLP) is a way for computers to analyze, understand and derive meaning from human language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iCapps gives a pretty &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;clear and straightforward definition of NLP&lt;/a&gt; . Essentially, the goal of NLP is to create &lt;strong&gt;programs able to understand regular, every-day language inputs&lt;/strong&gt; instead of having the user pre-process his queries to make them understandable by a machine (The early “Siri” talk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, &lt;strong&gt;NLP relies on six key steps&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll detail what lies behind each of these steps to make the link between a written prompt to natural language expression analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization&#34;&gt;Tokenization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before processing any written prompt, the text must be broken down into words and sentences to facilitate the analysis. In that regard, &lt;strong&gt;tokenization is pre-processing&lt;/strong&gt;: it identifies the basic units (words and sentences) that will be processed during the analysis. While this step may seem basic, the tokenization must be accurate for the rest of the analysis to be relevant. Indeed, since tokenization is the first step of NLP, &lt;strong&gt;errors made here will propagate and cause problems of interpretation later on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem basic (words are separated from each other by spaces, duh!) &lt;strong&gt;the reality of tokenization is more complex:&lt;/strong&gt; “Los Angeles” is an individual entity even though it’s made of two words. “I’m” is two words and two different ideas without any blank space between them. Besides, &lt;strong&gt;NLP techniques may be applied to “dirty texts”&lt;/strong&gt; — prompts that contain spelling mistakes, incorrect spacing, or improper use of punctuation — making it even trickier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, different methods of tokenization have been developed, each with their strengths and weaknesses. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/nlp/entry/tokenization?lang=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IBM’s developer blog article&lt;/a&gt; on the subject is a good starting point to learn more about it. &lt;strong&gt;Tokenization methods are not absolute&lt;/strong&gt;: they are chosen and adapted depending of the nature of text analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lexicalanalysis&#34;&gt;Lexical Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a successful tokenization process, the words are properly separated from each other. Naturally, the next step is to categorize the tokens to facilitate their processing. An effortless way to classify the tokens is to **use an already existing categorization of language **— the grammatical nature of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
_The linguistics behind chatbots — _&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s convenient because the match between a word and its grammatical nature is &lt;strong&gt;easily done using a dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;. On top of that, because grammar is the set of rules governing the composition of clauses and phrases in the language, sorting tokens with &lt;strong&gt;the grammatical criteria makes the following steps easier&lt;/strong&gt;, especially the next one: the syntactic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;syntactic-analysis&#34;&gt;Syntactic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tokenization and the lexical analysis happen at the word level, the syntactic analysis jumps to the sentence level to identify the relationship between each word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it takes you back to school: article + adjective(s) + noun = subject group and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/chatbot-masquerade/linguistics-2.png&#34;

_The linguistics behind chatbots — _&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;syntactic analysis provides order and structure of each sentence in the text.&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying the subjects, for instance, is particularly important for one of the following steps — discourse integration — which looks at the context around each sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;semanticanalysis&#34;&gt;Semantic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this step, the computer looks for the meaning of each word. What may once again seem like a &lt;strong&gt;simple step for a human&lt;/strong&gt; (we have dictionaries for this, duh!) is &lt;strong&gt;trickier for a computer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some words are straightforward and therefore easy to interpret — “monosemy” for instance is &lt;strong&gt;the perfect body and soul example&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s a noun referring &lt;strong&gt;exclusively&lt;/strong&gt; to “the property of having only one meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended meaning can be much harder to figure out for &lt;strong&gt;polysemic words&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/set&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;“Set” has 119 different meanings&lt;/a&gt; and can be used as a transitive or intransitive verb, a noun, an adjective, an interjection as well as taking part in verb phrases (such as “set back”) and in idioms (such as “all set”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous steps facilitate this one to some extent. Indeed, if we know that “set” is used as a noun, we’re down to 28 possible different meanings. &lt;strong&gt;Context is crucial here to find out the meaning intended by the speaker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discourse-integration&#34;&gt;Discourse Integration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discourse integration looks at the &lt;strong&gt;significance of the sentences compared to the preceding sentences&lt;/strong&gt;. Cohesion between following sentences of the text is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the key lies in &lt;strong&gt;pronouns which must be correctly recognized as such and then linked to the relevant antecedent&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, in the following statement the computer needs to be able to properly recognize “it” and link it to “Google”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is a search engine. It helps individuals find the information they are looking for online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this example is really straightforward. Yet, a real, natural sentence rarely is. Anaphoric references can be hard to interpret, &lt;strong&gt;especially in natural language where pronouns antecedents can be unclear or missing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pragmatic-analysis&#34;&gt;Pragmatic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragmatics study the ways context contributes to meaning. &lt;strong&gt;It’s the step going from what is said to what is meant&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the hardest of the six steps. Ambiguity is hard to handle with computers, yet this is all we do while we humans talk. Depending on languages and situations, context can be more or less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even human linguists have a tough time defining methods to analyze what meaning is brought by the context. &lt;strong&gt;Diverse theories emerged to account for the referential use of language&lt;/strong&gt; such as Jakobson’s six functions of language (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobson%27s_functions_of_language&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Referential, Poetic, Emotive, Conative, Phatic and Metalingual&lt;/a&gt;) or the Speech Act Theory (Which &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;studies performative utterances &lt;/a&gt;— a statement that produces an act by itself such as “The meeting is now adjourned.). Defining what is context is already a hard job for a linguist; &lt;strong&gt;contextual awareness is arguably the hardest part of NLP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-they-fail-the-seven-sins-ofchatbots&#34;&gt;Why do they fail? The seven sins of chatbots
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently available chatbots most often fail to meet the expectations of users for reasons ranging from &lt;strong&gt;design issues to technical limitations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chatbot.fail/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Fabricio from UXdesign.cc&lt;/a&gt; sums up, predominantly from a design perspective, the seven sins of chatbots. Here’s my take on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limited-ai-availability&#34;&gt;Limited AI availability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though NLP platform and libraries are becoming more accessible and common, &lt;strong&gt;AI is still hard and costly to implement.&lt;/strong&gt; What this means is that despite the technological hype behind chatbots, &lt;strong&gt;a large part of the currently deployed bot base is still relying on a word-triggered, decision-tree logic to answer the queries&lt;/strong&gt;. This type of bot is only as intelligent as the thoroughness of the person who designed the tree and his ability to anticipate potential use cases and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these bots might be efficient in certain specific contexts, they also &lt;strong&gt;quickly generate frustration because of their lack of linguistic capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;. They are quite often at a loss when faced with the way we talk in the real world: abbreviations, ungrammatical phrasing, spelling mistakes… Moreover, because of their tree-based decision logic, &lt;strong&gt;they are not able to respond appropriately to non-anticipated use cases&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-use-cases-really-thatstrong&#34;&gt;Are use cases really that strong?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When innovative technologies are emerging, they tend to generate a particular excitation among the developers’ and designers’ communities. Just like the apps, or the website before that, &lt;strong&gt;chatbots are becoming a must-have for any business who wishes to appear innovative&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a &lt;strong&gt;chatbot gold-rush&lt;/strong&gt; leading to the development of bots solving irrelevant use cases or offering sub-par customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a &lt;strong&gt;multiplication of ill-conceived bots&lt;/strong&gt; either missing to fit a real use case or just doing it worse that the existing solutions (sites, apps): dad jokes bots, personal florist bots, weather bots… See Darren Orf’s hall of horrors on the matter: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/facebook-messenger-chatbots-are-more-frustrating-than-h-1770732045&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook Chatbots Are Frustrating and Useless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good chatbots, on the other hand, are those who &lt;strong&gt;solve a problem in a more convenient and straightforward way that websites or apps would have done.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kipsearch/kip-for-slack-edc84908f298&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Kip is a Slack bot&lt;/a&gt; made to simplify the handling of grocery and food collective orders at the office. The &lt;strong&gt;efficient usage of Slack’s built-in functions&lt;/strong&gt; allows @Kiptalk to be handy and reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-transparency-whowhom-am-i-talkingto&#34;&gt;Lack of transparency: Who/Whom am I talking to?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way chatbots present themselves frame the user interaction&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though bot-makers want to make them feel as human as possible, they must remember the importance of setting up the right expectations. &lt;strong&gt;People are empathetic towards other people, not machines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice between a “humanized bot” and a bot assuming his mechanical identity is hard; essentially, it boils down to the relationship you’re looking to build between your chatbot and its users. &lt;strong&gt;Users tend to be more patient and willing to tolerate mistakes made by a bot who’s honest about its robotic nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giving bots generic pre-made answers to use while he doesn’t understand a query can help maintain the conversation flow, &lt;strong&gt;does it help to build trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-context-awareness&#34;&gt;Lack of context awareness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human conversation is hard to replicate because of its &lt;strong&gt;reliance on context:&lt;/strong&gt; we use and understand sarcasm, adapt our way of chatting depending on the channels and the persons we address (see &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.signosemio.com/jakobson/functions-of-language.asp&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jakobson’s phatic function of language&lt;/a&gt;) and can read between the lines. Bots can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a friend coming over to your place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend_: “Do you have beers?”_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You_: “Help yourself.”_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nothing more than these two words, your friend infers that you do have beers, that they’re probably in their usual place and he can grab one or two if you’re drinking too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure chatbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is asking for your location at every query.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bots that are not powered by natural language processing technologies can’t hold contextual information for a long time. &lt;strong&gt;They may lose track of what the customer is saying before he asks his question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this shortcoming, we can’t exchange with the bot naturally, &lt;strong&gt;we must adapt our prompt&lt;/strong&gt; to include location each time we ask him something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-communications-with-existing-businesssystems&#34;&gt;Lack of communications with existing business systems
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be efficient, &lt;strong&gt;bots need to be able to interact with current business processes&lt;/strong&gt; instead of creating new ones. Ultimately, chatbots are part of a broad ecosystem constituted of numerous touch points between customers and brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a chatbot operating in silo not only hurts the bot’s ability to process and respond to users’ queries; it also makes it harder &lt;strong&gt;for the business to handle the requests generated by the bot channels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only bots able to interact with pre-existing business processes can consistently produce value&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Kip discussed before: he orders the item specified on the grocery list collected with Slack using Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-offocus&#34;&gt;Lack of focus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient bots tackle specific issues where they can provide more value than their pre-existing counterparts&lt;/strong&gt; (website, apps, or any other mode of interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pre-existing channels to solve the defined user problem must be thoroughly studied&lt;/strong&gt; to make a chatbot that is an improvement regarding the design and efficiency of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, lack of focus can result in a bot that is both hard to develop and to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-human-escalation-protocol&#34;&gt;Lack of human escalation protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bots are not the answer to all customer interactions. Even though the temptation of automation is understandable for businesses with many clients, &lt;strong&gt;there are always situations where a human touch is required&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These situations must be thought of and included in the bots’ decision tree/actions. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;without proper escalation, these situations result in a user left hanging&lt;/strong&gt;, probably frustrated by their unsuccessful interaction with the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current dominant business perspective tends to see &lt;strong&gt;chatbots as a way to reduce the need for real humans to handle customer interaction&lt;/strong&gt;. The truth of efficient and engaging bots is the opposite: they’re used to create a new interaction channel where a real person will be available if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of what NLP is, from a linguistic perspective and why primary reasons behind current bots’ failure, it’s time to go back to the linguistics and explore what bots need to achieve a truly natural-like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since linguistics features vary per language, we’ll focus only on English, which is the most common language for bots and the one for which the research is the most advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-achieve-truly-natural-like-expression&#34;&gt;How to achieve truly natural-like expression?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;vocabulary-quantity-is-easy-polysemy-isnot&#34;&gt;Vocabulary: quantity is easy, polysemy is not
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the estimates and the way a “word” is defined, there are around 500,000 words in the English language. &lt;strong&gt;Most of them are very rarely used&lt;/strong&gt;: they may be obsolete, part of a field-specific jargon or register-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, an educated native English speaker has an active vocabulary of roughly 50 000 words (Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269554913_Words_in_the_Mind_An_Introduction_to_the_Mental_Lexicon&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jean Aitchison and Detlef Stark&lt;/a&gt;). Once again, out of these 50,000 words, &lt;strong&gt;few of them make for most of our texts&lt;/strong&gt;. Frequently used words include the most flexible: verbs, prepositions, and pronouns. &lt;strong&gt;Research indicates that 2,145 words account for 80% of all English text (&lt;strong&gt;The linguistic accuracy of chatbots: Usability from an ESL perspective — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272536147_The_linguistic_accuracy_of_chatbots_Usability_from_an_ESL_perspective&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;David Coniam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the analysis of the semantic analysis challenges proved, the difficulty does not lie in the quantity of vocabulary to apprehend but in its flexibility: &lt;strong&gt;polysemy is tough to compute&lt;/strong&gt;. We have access to context to sort out between the dozens of potential meanings of a word to find the one relevant to our current situation. Currently, chatbots have little to no context awareness; &lt;strong&gt;they must rely on other strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-maxims-of-an-honestchatbot&#34;&gt;The maxims of an honest chatbot
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we talk, a lot of the transmission of meaning happens by the choice we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When photographer takes a picture, he gives it an angle, saturation, a particular framing — ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;he translates his perspective, his view to what is in the most basic sense a very truthful representation of the real world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do the same with language. We choose to talk about certain things and not others, use specific words to refer to what we meant, order these words a certain way among all the possibilities… &lt;strong&gt;Those choices carry meaning by themselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we’re left to guess why the person talking to you made these linguistic choices. &lt;strong&gt;Our analysis is not purely intuitive or random&lt;/strong&gt;. To understand the implicature of prompts (the implied meaning) we rely on a few fundamental principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Herbert Paul Grice&lt;/a&gt; studied semantics and is well known for his theory of implicature. He isolated four main maxims we use to understand implicatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Quantity&lt;/strong&gt; — we make the information we give as informative as required (for the current purpose of the exchange), but not too detailed (which would hinder comprehension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Quality&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to make a contribution that is true. Which means to omit saying what we believe is false but also avoid talking while lacking sufficient evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Relevance&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to stay relevant and say things that are pertinent within the context of the discussion… A tough one for a bot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Manner&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to make ourselves easy to understand. This means to stay as concise as possible, avoid ambiguity, make ourselves clear and try to stay orderly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have an intuitive understanding of these maxims and expect every speaker we encounter to follow them as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. While the people we talk with don’t do so, we tend to get frustrated by the exchange which becomes either hard to follow (too much quantity / not enough quality / not relevant enough / lack of manners) or not informative enough (lack of quantity or quality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to expect that &lt;strong&gt;we hold the chatbots&lt;/strong&gt; — if they are natural enough — &lt;strong&gt;up to the same standards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bots-self-reference-whatwho-are-we-talkingto&#34;&gt;The bot’s self-reference: what/who are we talking to?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the advanced tech behind chatbots, the though-process on their design and “personality” is still at a very early stage. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the submissive female persona in still very prevalent in bots&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, bots who can process and answer queries with audio predominantly adopt a female voice for speech generation. Siri, probably the most famous virtual assistant was released at first with a female voice in 2011. The option to give a male voice to Siri only came two years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bot-builders avoid the gender definition issue by crafting gender neutral persona. For instance, Kip, the slackbot discussed earlier use a penguin mascot as its persona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, bot builders have three options when it comes to the chatbot self-reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid it all together&lt;/strong&gt;: diverse self-reference avoidance strategies can be enforced such as using a gender-neutral mascot, or producing an evasive answer when the bot is asked directly what its gender is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the first person singular pronoun “I”&lt;/strong&gt;: although the “I” is the simplest way to deal with this question, &lt;strong&gt;it also sets elevated expectations for the customers&lt;/strong&gt;. If the bot fails to display a real personality, its self-reference might come up as purely artificial .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the first person singular pronoun “We”&lt;/strong&gt;: “we” can seem as a good middle ground. It might refer to the team behind the bot, or simply the team the bot is impersonating (such as the bank employees for a bank clerk bot). Yet, “we” has been already widely used to make business communications sound friendlier; &lt;strong&gt;a chatbot referring to himself as “we” might suffer from the “corporate we” fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wallis and Emma Norling researched &lt;strong&gt;the impact of social intelligence, or the lack thereof in conversational agents to deal with problematic situations&lt;/strong&gt; such as a rude callers (The Trouble with Chatbots: social skills in a social world — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~pelachau/AISB05/final/WalNor05.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Peter Wallis and Emma Norling&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;They highlighted the need for chatbots to be able to “play the game” to efficiently de-escalate conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An approach described in a forthcoming paper is based on the idea that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;emotions are basically a means of signaling escalation in conflict&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Although lions can inflict life-threatening injuries on each other, fights usually stop well before this happens. In the same way,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;an abusive response might be a signal that the agent is willing to (emotionally) hurt the human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and that the human had better stop soon or risk being hurt. Although a human might not have any inhibitions about ‘hurting the feelings’ of a machine,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;_they might feel differently about being called a moron themselves _&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;— even if it is by a machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-search-for-the-honestbot&#34;&gt;In search for the Honest Bot
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to get personal and emotionally invested with chatbots. Chatbotslife carried out an analysis of 10 billion messages sent to bots and noted that about 10% of bots receive an ‘I love you’ or ‘I hate you’ type of message.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Chatbotslife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is at stake behind the question of chatbots’ self-reference. Humans tend to mystify objects — &lt;strong&gt;we see objects for more than their mere physical existence&lt;/strong&gt;: a Coke is not just soda, it’s a lifestyle. Brett Scott discusses this process called fetishization in his article &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://howwegettonext.com/if-you-talk-to-bots-youre-talking-to-their-bosses-cd8e390c242f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;If You Talk to Bots, You’re Talking to Their Bosses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the emergence of chatbots pushes the boundaries of corporate personhood&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies already have legal personalities; bots can give them another layer of pseudo-humanity with a conversational and artificial personality blurring, even more, the frontier between corporations and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honest Bot does not currently exist. The new wave of bots are — to use a term popularized by the existentialist misfit Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye — the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ultimate phonies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. They’ll pretend to be friendly, to be cool, to be serious, to be insightful, and even to be self-reflective. But they’ll never just be themselves. Because,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the end, there is no “I.” There is only a company, its shares held by who knows who, possibly registered in Panama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brett Scott&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bots are now mostly seen as a new, practical way for the consumer to interact with brands, the search for the honest bot showcases the deep stakes of the chatbot industry. &lt;strong&gt;As the personalization of chatbots gets more and more precise, so does the data collected on each user&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can end up being resold and consolidated with other databases fulfilling the economic agenda of the bot’s owners and bot-platforms. The end-user might be left even more vulnerable than before to intrusive data-collection and advertising methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to &lt;strong&gt;question what are the benefits to be gained from chatbots and who will harness those benefits&lt;/strong&gt;. We should remain alert towards the hype and make sure we truly benefit from bots, not the other way around. Once they’ll be part of our everyday life, it’ll already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do brands crave chatbots because they are looking at automating certain positions (support, customer relations, etc.) previously handled by real, human workers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New companies that have never hired front-line workers and that are **starting out with an automated customer process **— a lot of Silicon Valley companies are like this e.g. AirBnB has never had actual customer-facing staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old companies that previously have had front-line customer-facing workers and who are now looking to provide a &lt;strong&gt;lower-cost option&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially with a view to &lt;strong&gt;eventually getting rid of the front-line workers&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. a lot of banks are like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latter context, the chatbot is seen as a more &lt;strong&gt;‘human’ experience’&lt;/strong&gt; than just giving them a webpage or app with options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isn’t the lack of human touch frustrating considering the current state of chatbots? Are chatbots a real improvement in terms of UX?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of whether the UX is authentically improved, I don’t know — I suspect a &lt;strong&gt;significant number of people could find chatbots pretty irritating&lt;/strong&gt;, and might just prefer a normal interface. The key difference with the normal interface though, is that it limits your queries through predefined categories, whereas the chatbot creates the &lt;strong&gt;illusion of being able to request or ask anything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess then the NLP stuff is about being able to fit those badly-spelled or strangely phrased queries into predefined categories that can be answered (as far as I know chatbots cannot yet improvise or make up answers or engage in spontaneous actions — &lt;strong&gt;they can only learn to take in unpredictable inputs and give out predictable outputs&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a brand perspective, chatbots embody a new interface to interact with customers. What are the characteristics of chatbots — as interfaces — compared to the usual ones (website, apps…)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can have a general critique of interfaces in that &lt;strong&gt;they obscure what goes on behind them&lt;/strong&gt; and we might argue that the chatbot is particularly good at that because it presents &lt;strong&gt;a human or ‘confidential’ persona&lt;/strong&gt; that lulls the user into thinking they are actually just interacting with a ‘being’ rather than an IT system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is data the main driver of chatbots’ adoption? — Are companies looking forward to implement chatbots because it allows them to collect even more data on their users?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure if the data extracted in this process is going to be greater than with any other digital interface, but perhaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
