<p>Dear Crypto Natives,</p>
<p>Remember that guy <a class="link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/01/07/this-man-has-been-living-on-bitcoin-for-3-years/#3c9a747a2697"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >who tried to live on Bitcoin</a> in 2013?</p>
<p>Living bankless was harder back then. No one accepted it. Lots of friction. But people kept saying that one day every Starbucks would accept Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But it didn’t stick.</p>
<p>It’s funny because the guy in that story is now <a class="link" href="https://fortune.com/2019/12/11/crypto-crown-prince-olaf-carlson-wee/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >a mega-millionaire</a> much the result of…not spending his Bitcoin!</p>
<p>What does that teach us? It teaches to not to spend our BTC &amp; ETH! Who wants to end up like <a class="link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Bitcoin pizza guy</a>?</p>
<p>But it’s time to check in again. New tools like stablecoins and DeFi protocols are now make going bankless easier…and even…better than a bank?</p>
<p>I asked <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/TokenBrice"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Brice</a> to share his story. He’s uses an Ethereum address, a few protocols, and a wallet + visa card combo to get passive DeFi income to pay for his lunches.</p>

</h2><p>Brice tells us his system for earning daily DAI to pay for expenses like lunch. He uses an Ethereum address as his bank, DAI as his stablecoin <a class="link" href="https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-get-a-dai-saving-account"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"

<ul>
<li>Goal: <em>Generate a stable return in DAI to cover for living expenses.</em></li>

    >Monolith</a> &amp; DeFiFrance Co-Organizer</p>
<p>My relationship with money has always been ambiguous. As a teen, I was your usual &ldquo;get money it’s spent that day&rdquo; kind of guy—I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking or strategic about it, just looking forward to enjoying what money enables.</p>
<h3 id="the-masterplan"><strong>The masterplan</strong>
</h3><p>As I grew up and started earning money on my own, I began thinking more and more about money and personal finance. Shortly after my first proper job, I was already doing math on my expenses, my income, and how long I would need to work and save in order to not have to work anymore. The dream of freedom.</p>
<p>Quickly, this turned into a basic plan with two arbitrary choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would aim to acquire $1.5M. I assumed this capital would earn 5% / year landing me around $75K/year of interest before taxes—enough to sustain my lifestyle if not too excessive.</li>
<li>And I’d get there by the time I&rsquo;m 35 (giving 20-30 good years to do my things)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It was obviously and predictably a failure</strong>. Between the start of my plan at 21 years old and now (I’m 28), I was barely able to save a fraction of the required amount.</p>
<h4 id="why-did-my-plan-fail"><strong>Why did my plan fail?</strong>
</h4><p>As I was learning about decentralised finance, I took some time to reflect on the back-then current failure of my masterplan. Here are the main reasons I identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I did not define steps to reach the end goal</strong>: I wanted to jump straight from no passive income to full passive income, without planing any intermediary step to make it more realistic and achievable.</li>
<li><strong>I had little to no discipline</strong> when it came to taming my expenses</li>
<li><strong>I overlooked the &ldquo;details&rdquo;</strong>. I had little to no idea of how I was actually going to produce a stable and consistent 5% return on such capital. I just assumed it would be attainable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enter-decentralised-finance"><strong>Enter decentralised finance</strong>
</h3><p>So let&rsquo;s jump to the current situation! I followed the development of the DeFi ecosystem very closely, thanks to my job at <a class="link" href="https://monolith.xyz/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Monolith</a> and the <a class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/DeFi-France/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >different meetups</a> I co-organise.</p>
<p>At first, I used DeFi out of curiosity: the amount I engaged was marginal—most of my net worth was still in ETH/ERC-20 tokens. Like most, I was both curious and perplexed—is this magic internet money experiment really working?</p>
<h3 id="my-aha-moment"><strong>My &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment</strong>
</h3><p>I started seriously using more DeFi services, like <a class="link" href="https://compound.finance/markets"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Compound</a> &amp; bZx and then later the <a class="link" href="https://oasis.app/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Dai Saving Rate</a> &amp; <a class="link" href="https://aave.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Aave</a>. It was awesome and magical, but it wasn&rsquo;t what lit the spark for me.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>The magic spark came from a piece a tokenised real estate I bought on Ethereum using <a class="link" href="http://realt.co/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >RealT</a>. You may already know RealT—it’s a platform for tokenized real-estate. You own property tokens and receive <strong>daily rental payments in DAI.</strong></p>
<p>Why this? It got my mind racing. This was how it went:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1st day of rent:</strong> oh okay, this thing is real. <em>By this point, I started discussing RealT with other people in the scene.</em></li>
<li><strong>End of first week:</strong> now I was checking my wallet balance every morning—seeing the list of rent paid was exhilarating but left me craving more!</li>
<li><strong>End of first month:</strong> at first I spent the DAI almost immediately using my <a class="link" href="https://monolith.xyz/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Monolith Visa card</a>. It was so tempting—the DAI sitting there in my wallet, accumulating every day.</li>
<li><strong>After first month:</strong> as the idea of daily DAI became a reality to me, I started rethinking about my masterplan: how much DAI do I need per day to live solely on that? How much capital would it represent? (<em>Hint: way less than $1.5M)</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dai-per-day-as-a-framework"><strong>DAI per day as a framework</strong>
</h3><p>What happened there? Why would RealT have this impact on me while Compound did not? (Huge respect for all the projects mentioned in this post, please keep going!)</p>
<p>I think the answer is more straightforward than what people expect:</p>
<p>We used to download movies or buy them to watch them. At some point, Netflix offered us streaming and 99% of us never looked back—<strong>I expect the same thing to happen with money.</strong></p>
<h4 id="money-that-empowers-people"><strong>Money that empowers people</strong>
</h4><p>Simply put, daily DAI streaming is a paradigm shift that enables most of us to instantly become much smarter and efficient in the way we relate and manage our assets. It’s empowering to the individual.</p>
<p>Why? The concept of DAI per day reinforces two powerful ideas: first, streaming money and second, using DAI as the base monetary reference.</p>
<p>Why is streaming money a paradigm shift?</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes it easy to break down significant objectives in small chunks</li>
<li>There is no wait time between the first initial investment and the first payout. Payouts are available instantly—and spendable anywhere that <a class="link" href="https://monolith.xyz/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >accepts Visa</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why is DAI a paradigm shift?</p>
<ul>
<li>DAI is a stablecoin—you don’t have to hoard it or worry about daily value lose</li>
<li>DAI is at a bridge: easy to spend in the real world but also a hop away from all other Ethereum-based assets (including passive income assets like RealT)</li>
<li>As DeFi grows sources of DAI/day are becoming more numerous and attractive</li>
<li>Finally, the tokens used for payouts are more diverse (consider liquidity pools). Bringing everything back in DAI/day gives you exhaustive visibility over all your crypto-passive income sources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="that-daily-dai-lifestyle"><strong>That Daily Dai Lifestyle</strong>
</h3><p>Enough context, let&rsquo;s get practical: what can we do today with these shiny new financial levers?</p>
<p>I went back to my masterplan to give it a second try.</p>
<p>This time, instead of going straight for full financial independence, I decided to aim for something more practical. For me, it was straightforward: I have three lunches in London every week, costing me around $30 per week on average.</p>
<p>That means I need roughly <strong>4.3 DAI per day</strong> to pay for them.</p>
<p><strong>I could also skip lunch, but I decided to have it for free thanks to DeFi!</strong> I&rsquo;m not there yet but getting close: according to my revised plan, I&rsquo;ll be getting free lunches by the end of March.</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-a-5-dai-per-day-portfolio"><strong>Starting with a 5 DAI per day portfolio</strong>
</h3><p>I am currently exploring different possibilities in my portfolio, so let&rsquo;s consider a simple one: one that nets you 5 DAI per day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you can expect if you want a simple passive DAI strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-9% APR with DAI: for instance, locking your <a class="link" href="https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-get-a-dai-saving-account"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >DAI in the DSR</a> is at 8%</li>
<li>9-12.5% APR with income assets: but with a higher risk, using RealT</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s if you want to set it and forget about it. There are other opportunities with additional earning opportunities. For instance, if you own a RealT asset, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to sell at a premium on Uniswap</li>
<li>Benefits from their liquidity incentive program</li>
</ul>
<p>But let’s keep this simple and passive:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll stick with the Dai Saving Rate—the safest way to produce DAI interests right now—and RealT—a more risky bet that can offer higher returns</li>
</ul>
<p>How much in assets values is required for 5 Daily DAI at the below rates?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="going-farther"><strong>Going farther</strong>
</h4><p>While this is a simple framework to get started it suffers from some limits. For instance, if you&rsquo;re looking to generate 100 DAI/day from this approach, RealT will not cut it. You&rsquo;ll run into issues of liquidity (not enough estate available) or systemic risk (you&rsquo;d be owning a sizeable share of ALL RealT estates).</p>
<p>With my current understanding, I intend to maintain a similar strategy up to roughly 10 DAI/day. My current portfolio also includes aDAI.</p>
<p>As I blast through the 10 DAI/day, this year, that is if the plan stands, I will be diversifying more and more. I think liquidity pools &amp; staking (SNX, for instance) can be a way to go. However, I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with these topics &amp; haven&rsquo;t started committing serious amounts of money to it—so I&rsquo;m not the best one to talk about it right now: maybe in a few months?</p>
<p>Wonder how this looks in practice? <a class="link" href="https://etherscan.io/address/tokenbrice.eth"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >See for yourself at tokenbrice.eth.</a></p>

<p><em>(Above: see Brice’s DAI earnings &amp; spending in real-time—<a class="link" href="https://app.zerion.io/0x030de46c333dfd602442a103919412a7987d0ac7/lend?utm_campaign=aw&amp;utm_medium=header_button&amp;utm_source=landing"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >plug tokenbrice.eth into Zerion</a>)</em></p>
<h3 id="-on-projections">** On projections…**
</h3><p>Allow me to loop back to my masterplan. While the DAI per day approach is fantastic it has one main downside: it makes yearly projections harder.</p>
<p>Take a minute now and try to guess how much daily DAI you need to produce 50k DAI per year? Did you do it?</p>
<p>How close were you to 137, the actual answer? Most people tend to overestimate.</p>
<p>So while DAI/day is my base, I also look at two other levels to not lose track of the big picture: the DAI per month and the DAI per year.</p>
<h3 id="going-bankless-in-the-real-world"><strong>Going bankless in the real world</strong>
</h3><p>I hope you found value in this tactic—my goal is practical DeFi: demonstrating what you can do harnessing DeFi today. This post was written down &amp; translated adaptation of my <a class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/DeFi-France/events/268374027/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >last talk at DeFi France.</a></p>
<p>Late last year <a class="link" href="https://slideslive.com/38920018/living-on-defi-how-i-survive-argentinas-50-inflation"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Mariano Conti’s talk</a> sent an <a class="link" href="https://bankless.substack.com/p/straddling-two-worlds-crypto-and"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >electro-shock to the crypto world</a>: he reminded us that DeFi is already used for very real situations, such as avoiding losing 50% of your net worth to inflation.</p>
<p>It was the perfect demonstration of someone living in the real world using the opportunities offered by DeFi. My goal was to provide the European version of it.</p>
<p>Mariano survived inflation using DeFi.</p>
<p>I, on the opposite, want to live my best life, thanks to DeFi.</p>
<p>Here’s the magic: <strong>both of us are acting in our own best interest and in doing so, we are supporting the development of a fairer &amp; more accessible financial system for all.</strong></p>
<p>This is a clear illustration of how fast the industry is evolving: hop on &amp; enjoy the ride!</p>
