        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/blockchain-telco/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Blockchains meet Telecommunications: Opportunity, Risk, or A Necessity?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the telecom industry benefit from blockchains and decentralized ledger technologies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies are set to revolutionize many industries. While the technical component themselves are nothing new, the blockchain mixes them up in a previously unexplored layout that enables &lt;strong&gt;many new use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, blockchains are a new kind of live and self-updating databases exploring new models of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into blockchains applied to the telco industry, let’s address some of the most critical dimensions of blockchains. We’ll then be able to consider the potential &lt;strong&gt;use cases blockchains enable for the telecommunication industry&lt;/strong&gt; with live examples of existing projects whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-3-minutes-intro-to-blockchains&#34;&gt;A 3 minutes intro to blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-blockchains&#34;&gt;What are blockchains?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains (and others distributed ledger technologies known as DLT) allow nurturing different relationships between service/data providers and their users. The main innovation carried by blockchains lie in their &lt;strong&gt;distributed nature&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through game-theory mechanics and cryptographic seals, blockchains offer a credible solution to the challenge of &lt;strong&gt;maintaining a database without having a central authority&lt;/strong&gt; (such as an institution) warranting its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a &lt;strong&gt;network of peers&lt;/strong&gt; review the transactions and the ones that are validated are added to the chain. Checking mechanisms can vary depending on the needs and use cases solved by the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining is the most well known of such mechanism, and currently used by the most prominent project such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blockchains are irreversible. Once a change is validated and reviewed by the peers maintaining the network, it cannot be altered. Each new “blocks” added after makes it even less likely to be modified. Each transaction added to the chain is &lt;strong&gt;time-stamped&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cryptographically sealed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all transactions are public and &lt;strong&gt;auditable&lt;/strong&gt; — anyone can check at any time which block is validated, when, by whom, and what transactions it contains (emitting address, receiving address and amount transferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the peer-validation mechanism, the cryptographic seal, and the transparency offered by the blockchain’s publicity makes them &lt;strong&gt;“trustless”&lt;/strong&gt;: their users don’t need to trust a central body to proceed the transaction, as it doesn’t exist. Besides, since the book is public, anybody can verify that there is no foul play.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Potential benefits of blockchain (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=10f56b96-b249-4621-949c-f25514fc127a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-blockchains-have-tooffer&#34;&gt;What do blockchains have to offer?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockchain was initially developed to offer an alternative to centralized monetary systems, with projects such as Bitcoin or Litecoin which got a lot of press. However, the &lt;strong&gt;decentralized, transparent and auditable ledgers&lt;/strong&gt; offered by blockchains-based system allow for many innovative use cases in diverse industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;the missing technological block enabling the switch&lt;/strong&gt; between systems with several levels of intermediation, each level requiring trust and creating a potential for abuses and manipulations to more direct and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By autonomous, we’re not picturing the artificial intelligence-fueled self-deciding robot fantasy but quite the opposite: peer-driven systems with enough checks and balances built-in so that they won’t require external forces (such as laws) to maintain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain-based technologies are still at a very &lt;strong&gt;early stage of development&lt;/strong&gt; and not yet able to achieve this vision. However, they are not to dismiss altogether until further advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limitations of our current AI systems, we’ve found many use-cases them for them. They still fail dramatically at complex task involving several interlaced processes, but perform quite well with a very narrow and well-defined scope: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40042581&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;beating the world’s Go champion,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.asmag.com/showpost/24046.aspx&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;traffic monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;trivia games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its early stage, blockchains-based systems are bound for similar implementations. They will &lt;strong&gt;take over well-defined scope&lt;/strong&gt; within industries, starting with positions where there is a significant need for traceability and transparency and the current share taken by intermediaries is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-in-practice-usecases&#34;&gt;Blockchains in practice: use cases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust is the cornerstone of the business. Blockchains enable &lt;strong&gt;trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution&lt;/strong&gt;. It will streamline relationships between partners and reduce frictions between the various stakeholders involved in a given system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralized dimension of blockchain-based systems, if maintained, could foster a new kind of trust that is no longer based on the reputations of the actor but instead rely on the &lt;strong&gt;credibility gathered by the systems themselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-are-blockchains-goodfor&#34;&gt;So, what are blockchains good for?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could ease and empower identity verification processes, allowing users to control easily and precisely which data piece is shared, when and with whom. &lt;br&gt;
It could also facilitate cross-industries interconnections between different systems, reduce abuses both on the user-side (identity-theft) and on the businesses sides (fraud).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment processing&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain-based systems can power payment networks with novel and exciting characteristics. Transactions can be validated in a near instantaneous fashion (&amp;lt;10s) while processing fees are so low than micro-transactions can be considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could finally fulfill the promise of a subscription as easy as it to terminate it. Standards are currently drafted (such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/948&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ERC-948&lt;/a&gt;) to allow services providers to offer subscriptions that would be blockchain-based. &lt;br&gt;
Such subscriptions would be easy to manage from the user side. They also provide a predictable revenue stream to the service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data tracking and validation&lt;/strong&gt;: thanks to blockchain the cryptographic seal and data verification process, it could help to facilitate the validation of data, be it from sensors or other devices. The verification mechanisms can guarantee the data is coming from an authenticated and well-functioning device. &lt;br&gt;
This will prevent detrimental decisions based on corrupted data. The data will be time-stamped and easily auditable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/strong&gt;: the IoT requires sound authentication and data sharing processes to develop. Just like the identity management use case, blockchain could facilitate and provide a backbone for the authentication of machines and their data exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These five high-level use cases for blockchains can unfold in many different industries, triggering new developments are a power redistribution. For the rest of the article, we’ll limit ourselves to the telco industry and consider the main activities that could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-use-cases-for-the-telcoindustry&#34;&gt;Blockchains use cases for the telco industry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications of blockchains based technologies presented in the previous sections to the telecom industry are plenty. Some are quite obvious, as they provide an alternative to already existing solutions. Others require more abstraction to be considered since they involved several use cases nested with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;devices-identification&#34;&gt;Devices Identification
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of SIM cards currently permits the identification of devices on cellular networks. While the technology has its merits (especially cost-efficiency), it might not be the most adapted for 5G and device-to-device networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;public-key cryptography&lt;/a&gt; logic, implemented in blockchain systems might offer a credible alternative to solve the challenges posed by the &lt;strong&gt;dynamic authentication of potentially billions of (autonomous) devices&lt;/strong&gt; on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication on existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin relies on &lt;strong&gt;a pair of keys&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public key is the public ID of the recipient&lt;/strong&gt;. For bitcoin, it is used to receive payment. It works like an email address: anybody that knows it can send money to it, but only the owner of the related private key can generate a transaction from this address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The private key is used to verify ownership of the address.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing with the email comparison, the private key would be the password of the email address. It is required to send emails (initiate transactions) from that address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to eSIM, embedded SIM card, a virtual SIM standard, is already happening: the latest generation of Apple devices are supporting the standard. Since the SIM card is no longer physical, strong security standards are necessary to prevent abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a blockchain-based authentication protocol could ensure the &lt;strong&gt;safe authentication&lt;/strong&gt; while also allowing for greater &lt;strong&gt;flexibility and interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identity-as-a-service-and-data-management&#34;&gt;Identity as a Service and Data Management
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are particularly apt to enable tighter control of users over their data. In the wake of Cambridge Analytica, and other data over-sharing and data breaches related scandal (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;), consumers are realizing how exposed their data can be and &lt;strong&gt;the lack of control their have over it&lt;/strong&gt;, once they hand it to a service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom industry actors and particularly mobile service providers could play a role to prevent further scandals and breaches from happening. They could provide consummers with the next generation of data management services (Identity as a Service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced projects, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.civic.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uport.me/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uPort&lt;/a&gt; are looking to reshape the way we share data online. Their users create a blockchain-backed identity and populate it with the pieces of information they are willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such identity can be represented by the address of a smart contract or a traditional public key. Since other smart contracts can control smart contracts, they can be programmed to support various methods of key recovery logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mobile-data-reselling&#34;&gt;Mobile data reselling
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since telecommunication networks are built on top of legacy implementations, some usage situations can get almost nonsensical. For instance, if a French (with a French mobile/data plan) travels with his phone to the US and browse the web, all his traffic will be routed through France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interconnection cost for the service provided, as well as the margin taken by the operator dramatically increase the price he has to pay. He could purchase data from a local instead. Using a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic data reselling network&lt;/strong&gt;, he can get the data bandwith he needs from a nearby American with some spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be able to browse in a much more cost-effective fashion. Thanks to the transactional capabilities of blockchain based systems, they are excellent candidates to power a worldwide data reselling network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This use case is already covered by live projects such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.dentwireless.com/dent-app&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DENT&lt;/a&gt; which connects to over 400 mobile operators in 130 countries. They aim to accelerate the decrease of roaming fees, to bring them as close as possible to the operational costs. DENT or other similar projects are looking to make use of the spare capacity available on the network and data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-sourcing-and-decentralizing-the-telecommunication-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Open-sourcing and decentralizing the telecommunication infrastructure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of supplementing the current telco infrastructure, some projects are more ambitious. Their goal is to build a &lt;strong&gt;brand new and decentralized infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of such projects believe that a decentralized network would be more apt to sustain the growing data needs while offering more security guarantees to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://qlcchain.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;QLCChain project&lt;/a&gt; dubs itself as “decentralized network as a service”. They set to construct an open-source telecom infrastructure on the blockchain. The network is powered by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardware&lt;/strong&gt; (BaseStation),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; enabling the transaction of network services and the execution of smart contracts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as well as &lt;strong&gt;a token (QLC)&lt;/strong&gt; to structure the exchanges of value within the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is currently testing the network, looking to open it to the public by the end of the year. Here is a high-level overview of their network infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-telco-related-blockchain-usecases&#34;&gt;Other telco-related blockchain use cases
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology develops, new use cases are enabled. We presented four credible and interesting ones that can turn into massively used services in a relatively near future. There are however many other use cases that could be envisioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing intermediaries involved in services such as &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name Service&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NAT&lt;/a&gt;), or even fully decentralize them. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://peername.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Several solutions are already implemented&lt;/a&gt; to replace traditional DNS on the web and provide a name service to resolve public keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring &lt;strong&gt;credit reselling&lt;/strong&gt; of internet-level communication networks, particularly for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;VoIP resellers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, creating a protocol to resell minutes of voice communication over the VoIP network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transparency provided by blockchains, as well as their resistance to attacks and alteration makes them a perfect fit for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/07/blockchain-for-fraud-prevention-industry-use-cases/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fraud prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits-for-industryactors&#34;&gt;Benefits for industry actors
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As blockchain-based technologies mature, they will enable &lt;strong&gt;new revenue streams and partnership opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; for existing telecommunication service and network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of blockchain based networks and services will dramatically &lt;strong&gt;change the balance of power and profit between existing intermediaries.&lt;/strong&gt; New partnerships will be formed, some legacy intermediaries might become obsolete and replaced by cheaper, faster and more effective alternative. Skipping such intermediaries will streamline operations and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the financial dimension of the telecommunication operations, blockchains enable many opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Near real-time settlements&lt;/strong&gt; offered by digital payment systems will simplify accounting procedures and reduce operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new validation mechanisms provided by blockchain will streamline accountability even further. Instead of relying on disparate systems to find and collate different financial views, a blockchain ledger will provide &lt;strong&gt;one unified view covering almost all transactions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain is still at an early development stage. The main challenge right now is to correctly identify relevant and realistic upcoming opportunities to direct developments and investments purposely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further the impact of blockchain and telcos, check out the paper published by Deloitte’s Blockchain Institute: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/za_TMT_Blockchain_TelCo.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Blockchain @ TelcoHow blockchain can impact thetelecommunications industryand its relevance to the C-Suite.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;governments-vs-lex-cryptographica&#34;&gt;Governments VS. Lex Cryptographica
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal framework surrounding such system is currently lax, if not wholly lacking. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;most of&lt;/strong&gt; existing &lt;strong&gt;regulations focused on the financial use cases of blockchains&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Initial Coin Offering (~IPO for tokens). While this is perceived as a risk by most legacy industries actors, others see it as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since control mechanisms are built into blockchain-based systems, there might be no need for laws once they systems are mature enough. Such systems could &lt;strong&gt;implement their own regulatory frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;. The Harvard University Press published a fascinating read addressing the topic earlier this year. What follows is a quote taken from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Blockchain technology facilitates the emergence of new self-contained and autonomous systems of rules that create order without law and implement what can be thought of as private regulatory frameworks, which we refer to as *lex cryptographica*.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Is stability a necessity for cryptocurrencies mainstream adoption?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you talk about cryptocurrencies with people unfamiliar with it, the question of volatility is among the first to pop up. Quite often, it’s a low effort way to dismiss the whole world of cryptocurrencies and recent progress made with decentralization. Volatility does not affect all cryptocurrencies: some of them are made to be stable (price wise) — we call them the “stablecoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that point, let’s state some necessary facts to understand this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies are much more than just the Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more than 1500 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap, which is only the tip of the iceberg: in reality, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies circulating. The sheer amount of tokens can be scary, but it’s positive in the long run. It means that for every problem cryptocurrencies can solve you have dozens of different teams exploring as many different approaches — no stone is left unturned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever the initial vision of Satoshi was, &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin is unfit to become a mainstream currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Its technical limitation such as its low transaction speed or the issues with mining (energy consumption, centralization, etc.) makes it inapt for this use case. However, its persistence (Bitcoin is almost 10 years old!) as well as its reliability makes it a good “store of value”, just like gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, there are many projects with the ambition to become tomorrow’s mainstream currency. &lt;strong&gt;They answer the fundamental issue raised when considering Bitcoin as a currency: its volatility.&lt;/strong&gt; Those projects are called &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; and they will be the topic of this piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of volatility highlights a vital characteristic of a currency: price stability is a necessity to have a currency people feel confident using. Indeed, creating a new currency requires a thorough understanding of both technical mechanisms as well as social dynamics. In order &lt;strong&gt;to become a currency, a good must be recognized as such by its users and gain their trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-fiat-goingsouth&#34;&gt;Are fiat going south?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a strong correlation between the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the “weakness” of the national currency (called fiat currencies) in a given country. It’s hard to measure the adoption of cryptocurrency, but we can easily get figures on how many people are interested in buying some using Google Trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghanaian currency (the Cedi — GHS) went from roughly a dollar in 2008 to around 20 cents nowadays. Meanwhile, the Nigerian currency (the Naira — NGN) lost about half of its worth (measured against the dollar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devaluation happened fast enough for people living in these countries to see the impact of it. It could explain the strong interest we observe for cryptocurrencies in Ghana and Nigeria. However, the issue with the determining how much a given currency is worth is more complex than simply measuring it against the dollar. If we use the dollar as our reference point, we must question its stability: &lt;strong&gt;is the dollar itself even stable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice about it, the “yes” seems like the go-to answer. The dollar hasn’t changed over these last 50 years — a $1 bill emitted in 1968 would still be recognized as such today. However, what about its worth? It is changing all the time. Is one 1968 dollar still worth $1 then? The answer is simply no — it would give access to a purchasing power corresponding to roughly 7 present days dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the spread is of course inflation. The topic is sophisticated enough to have theses written about it, so we’ll leave it to others. Now that we have some context let’s get back to stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-a-stablecoin&#34;&gt;What’s a stablecoin?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the stablecoin is pretty simple, the challenge lies in the execution. &lt;strong&gt;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that trades at a fixed price against a good (such as gold) or a common currency (most often the dollar).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stablecoin’s worth is not stable; it is merely its value that is pegged to a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable asset. Creating a reliable stablecoin is already a real challenge, so creating a fixed-worth currency is a wild dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the question of having a stable value is interesting to consider. How would it look like? That one unit of the given currency is always worth one unit? That’s DOGE’s specialty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/doge.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to more serious matters: the stability of currency could be defined as the fact that one unit of it always grant access to the same value. This definition would be consistent with the definition of a currency proposed in a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better-3b8e66cd2e77&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the link between the currency and the actual value it gives access to is elegant, in theory. However, in the real world, it’s close to impossible to measure the buying power of a given currency exactly. It is why we’ll consider stability defined as a currency keeping a constant price in regards to other goods or currencies which have a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable value. Before we get to the different stablecoin projects there are, let’s examine their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-stablecoins-goodfor&#34;&gt;What are stablecoins good for?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have live and available stablecoins such as the USDT. They are mostly used by crypto exchanges and traders because they offer a way to avoid returning to fiat currencies and having to abide by all the legal framework that comes with it. Moreover, since their price is fixed against the dollar they are somewhat of a safe haven for traders: with them, they can get out of the market without really doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, stablecoins are mostly a traders’ gimmick used to get in and out of the market without bringing their money back into their bank account. Hence, &lt;strong&gt;in the short-term, they are mostly a speculative tool&lt;/strong&gt;. However, they can provide a real utility in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cryptocurrencies have high volatility compared to fiat currencies, they are not really used as currency. Almost nobody is choosing to get their pay in cryptocurrencies, or using them to buy their groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a stable cryptocurrency well integrated with the rest of the ecosystem would provide a credible solution to address these needs. At first, stablecoins would be the gateway between the fiat and the crypto world. In the long run, they could become the “fiat of cryptos” themselves: &lt;strong&gt;they would become cryptocurrencies which are stable enough to become a preferred payment method&lt;/strong&gt;. It would provide a broader and more reliable access to the services offered by other (non-stable) cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-stabilize-a-cryptocurrency-liveexamples&#34;&gt;How to stabilize a cryptocurrency: live examples
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fulfill their promise of stable exchange rate against a given fiat, stablecoins must offer a &lt;strong&gt;collateral&lt;/strong&gt;. As a result, several types of stablecoins emerged depending on the collateral mechanism they used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fiat-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Fiat collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most direct and simple approach to make a stablecoin, but also the most centralized. In brief, there is a central entity minting the stablecoin who owns a reserve of dollar corresponding to the volume put in circulation. This dollar reserve offers guarantees regarding the solvability of the coin and allow to exchange the stablecoin back to a dollar at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, this approach comes with several issues. First, it’s &lt;strong&gt;completely centralized&lt;/strong&gt; since a single entity is emitting the stablecoin and backing it. There are no other choices but to trust it. Besides the approach is &lt;strong&gt;economically inefficient&lt;/strong&gt;, especially at scale, as it requires to “freeze” an amount of money equal to the number of stablecoins in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USDT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is used by the USDT, the most widespread stablecoin. Despite its adoption, &lt;strong&gt;the USDT is widely denounced&lt;/strong&gt; for its lack of transparency — there is no reliable method allowing its users to verify than Tether (the institution emitting USDT) actually possesses in its reserve a stock of dollar corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation: around 2,8 billion currently. However, the ties between Tether and Bitfinex (the 4th cryptocurrency exchange regarding the trading volume) raise questions regarding the potential for market manipulation it allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TrueUSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in answer to the lack of transparency of the USDT, TrueUSD uses the same mechanism while offering more guarantees. Rather than owning the token themselves, TrustToken (the institution emitting TrueUSD) works with a network of banks and financial institutions which keep the funds in escrow for them. One of them, Cohen&amp;amp;Company, publishes an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.trusttoken.com/trueusd-attestation-reports-86f693b90a4?gi=749091358366&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;independent audit&lt;/a&gt; twice a month to confirm that the financial partners of TrustToken do hold in escrow a number of dollars corresponding to the volume of TUSD in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guarantees offered seem more reliable than for the USDT, yet the problem is similar: this system requires its user to trust TrustToken and its partners, and particularly Cohen&amp;amp;Company to be honest. It works until it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crypto-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Crypto collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fiat collateralized stablecoins are fulfilling (so far) their promise of stability, they are doing a disservice to cryptocurrencies as a whole whose aim is to provide a decentralized alternative to the legacy financial and monetary networks. To answer this concern, another type of stablecoins emerged. They use other cryptocurrencies as collateral and a network of smart contracts to peg their exchange price to the underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this type of stablecoins is facing issues too, the main one being the volatility of cryptocurrencies used as collateral. To address them, they necessitate &lt;strong&gt;a collateral superior to the value of the stablecoins emitted&lt;/strong&gt;, which hinders their potential large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MakerDAO — Dai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai is another stablecoin pegged to the dollar (1 Dai = $1). It has some interesting features, the main one being that it is fully decentralized. Indeed, the institution emitting the Dai is MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. It’s an &lt;strong&gt;organization which governing rules are automated and enforced through publicly auditable smart contracts&lt;/strong&gt;, making them transparent and unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai works in pair with MKR, the governance token. Owners of MKR can vote to decide on the mechanisms used to stabilized the Dai. The system is quite complex and could deserve several articles by itself. Dai was launched on December 17th 2017 after three years of development. Since its launch, its price was in the same range of stability than fiat collateralized stablecoins (+/- ~10 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;un-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Un-collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stablecoins are the most promising in the long run as the address the main concerns raised by the two previous types: they propose a decentralized solution which could be used at scale. These projects are still in the development phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them use algorithms which reduce or increase the amount of the given stablecoin in circulation to stabilize their price. If the price goes over the dollar, the circulating supply increases; if it goes below, the supply decreases. The two most prominent projects in this category are Basis and Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis wants to create an “algorithmic central bank” that would stabilize its price. Their system uses three different types of token which makes it quite complex. The goal is to reproduce a simplified version of the federal reserve system with the addition of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Carbon is trying to execute an approached theorized in 2014 already by Robert Sams called the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage shares&lt;/a&gt;. The solution is mostly theory for now and has yet to see a working implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins-a-gift-or-a-curse-for-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Stablecoins: a gift or a curse for cryptocurrencies?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are a recent yet fascinating innovation. There are many projects currently in development (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stablecoinindex.com/projects/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;non-exhaustive list&lt;/a&gt;) using diverse approaches. The typology proposed above is simplified: some projects mix several types of collateral while others use radically different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, stablecoins are speculative &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tools&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; more than anything else, but they can become one of the critical elements of the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the long run. Looking at the volume, the USDT is currently obliterating its competition, which creates a systematic risk for the whole cryptocurrencies market. If USDT was to fail, it could lead to widespread panic. Thus &lt;strong&gt;speculation pushed the market towards a highly centralized tool lacking any real transparency: a gentle irony for the future of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Money 101 - Discarding the myth of bartering to understand Bitcoin better" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is a critical element of our modern societies: a slight change in its mechanisms can have a much broader impact than simply affecting the economy. Therefore, a better comprehension of these mechanisms will give you a better grasp on various topics ranging from Political Economy to cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a complex subject, even more lately if we consider all the &lt;strong&gt;convoluted systems and protocols&lt;/strong&gt; that were progressively built on top of it: monetary creation, central banks, inflation… With this piece, we’ll go back to the basics and eventually down to cryptocurrencies: What defines a currency? Why do we need them? What types of currencies do exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up for a quite an adventure in which we discard old but still prevalent tales and propose necessary new ones to make complex mechanisms crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-the-origins-ofmoney&#34;&gt;The Tale of the Origins of Money
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear about currencies, you often get a tale that is easy to understand and compelling; yet it’s just a tale. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we were barterers, the my chicken for your corn kind of deal. Then, since bartering wasn’t efficient, we needed a more standardised mean of exchange: a good that could pass as a store of value. Precious metals were the perfect candidates — they became coins, a form of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, later on, those coins evolved once again and became paper money — still a currency, but the origin of their value shifted: while a coin gets its value from its very material (the precious metal it’s made of), the paper money needs an institution to emit it and guarantee its value one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the digital era, money evolved one more time. It’s now all “digital” — just bits, 0 and 1 located somewhere in a server and transiting almost instantly in the fiber network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take our time to methodically deconstruct the tale in order to dismiss it, we’ll learn quite a few things along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;money-is-not-a-store-ofvalue&#34;&gt;Money is not a store of value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lets-burn-some-cash-to-understand-moneybetter&#34;&gt;Let’s burn some cash to understand money better
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s study together the example that made the distinction between the two very clear to me: let’s say I burn a $20 bill — will any value be destroyed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/joker.jpeg&#34;

&gt;
Thanks to the Joker for helping with the experiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… Simply no! What has been destroyed is my ability to claim the aforementioned value: I can’t exchange the ashes of my bill for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-itrain&#34;&gt;Make it rain!
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between a store of value and a claim upon value allows us to also understand &lt;strong&gt;the obsession with circulating currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, money is not wealth by itself: as long as the money is not claimed (spent for goods or services), it has no contribution whatsoever to the wealth of the given country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/fly.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our previous cash burning experiment to dig deeper: when I burnt my $20 bill, it had no impact on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the USA. Yet, if I start to burn millions of dollars, we might start to see &lt;strong&gt;secondary consequences&lt;/strong&gt; affecting the GDP: since there will be less money circulating, there might be less people using it to claim value (a beer, clothes…) and therefore an impact on the real economy of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those secondary consequences will &lt;strong&gt;only happen if the cash I burnt was meant to be spent&lt;/strong&gt; — if burning the bills prevented me from claiming the value they carried. Hence, if I’m a multi billionaire (so let’s assume: incapable of spending all of my money), I can burn millions of dollar without having any impact on the economy: those millions would have never flowed back into the economy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting a stop to the flow of money which would have changed hands without that stop is like preventing others to work to provide value; this value would have been exchanged for currency if the money was circulating freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;counterfeit-money-realvalue&#34;&gt;Counterfeit money, real value?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get over with the myth of money as a store of value, let’s consider a third and last scenario. Let’s say I print a very **well done stash of counterfeit money **— everybody take it for the real one. Now I give out those bills to normal American citizens, and for the sake of the simplicity of this example, the FED doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, the happy citizens who got free real-like yet counterfeit bills will start spending them for goods and services — they will claim what is rightfully theirs because of their ownership of the bills, hence increasing the GDP of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all of this is a scam, no value was actually created: I only printed and handed out fake bills that people think legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money barely is the key to the gold chest. When money itself, its physical medium, still had value (such as gold or silver coins), the content of the chest was still tied to the amount written on the key. Now, we are in a system where keys are changing endlessly changing hands without ever returning to open the chest. &lt;strong&gt;Our trust in our currencies is so high that the amount written on the key is sufficient and even authoritative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bartering-and-its-inefficiency&#34;&gt;The myth of bartering and its inefficiency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the first tale about the origin of money presented in the beginning of this article: was bartering really as prevalent as the story make it seems?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place some context to answer this question. We’re talking about a world where money doesn’t exist yet; hell, the very notion of “property” is even clear yet. &lt;strong&gt;Of course there were exchanges, but the “exchange protocol” was very different that what we picture behind the idea of bartering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/swap.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premodern agricultural societies were largely self-sufficient: exchanges between the member of a given community followed informal systems based on relationships: the “economy” was powered by gifting and reciprocity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, rather than the &lt;code&gt;my goat for your corn&lt;/code&gt; kind of deal, it was more like &lt;code&gt;I will help you build this house because I know how to do it. Later on, you&#39;ll help me furnish this other house since you&#39;re a skilled woodworker. If you don&#39;t, it can put an end to 1/our relationship, 2/your very place in the community&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Considering the system depicted above was informal, the “if you don’t…” part didn’t need to be stated, it was understood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the premodern agricultural societies depicted above, barter also existed but wasn’t the main mean of exchange: it was useful to be able to exchange with people who didn’t share the kind of relationship we depicted — for exchanges between communities for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-distortion-of-the-historians-lens&#34;&gt;The distortion of the Historian’s lens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be another reason to explain why the tale of the evolution from bartering to currency is still prevalent. &lt;strong&gt;To reconstruct the past, historians use remains found in modern times&lt;/strong&gt;. Coins stand the test of time. On the opposite, informal gift/counter-gift dynamics barely leave any traces behind them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;The Origin of Ancient Helixism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the example frequently chosen to illustrate the bartering system are doubtful. We’re talking about &lt;code&gt;goat vs corn&lt;/code&gt; deals, but is it realistic in the context of a premodern agricultural society? Since they were mostly auto sufficient, bartering was for goods that weren&amp;rsquo;t required for the community&amp;rsquo;s survival, since these were already produced within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;downplaying-the-role-ofbanks&#34;&gt;DOWNPLAYING THE ROLE OF BANKS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tale of the origins of money, banks look like mere intermediary. They provide more or less practical systems allowing the money to flow: it used to be ledgers, and it’s still is but now we have a clunky web interface to write/edit stuff in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this skip &lt;strong&gt;the crucial role played by banks in our current monetary systems: monetary creation&lt;/strong&gt;. For the sake of the easy-of-comprehension of this article, I won’t dive into the depths of it in here, a quick presentation of it will have to suffice. This mechanism is called the fractional-reserve banking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;fractional-reserve&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short and (too) quick explanation — a central bank emit a monetary base allowing commercial banks to issue currency by themselves through loans. When Bob comes to Bank of America for a $10,000 loan, BA is not pulling money from its reserve to credit Bob’s account. No, what happens instead is this: the amount written in Bank of America’s ledger next to Bob’s name is increased by 10,000, and that’s pretty much it. The confidence is the banking system is preserved through mandatory reserve, corresponding to a fraction (~10%) of the loaned amount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Which leads us to our next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bits-a-digital-ledger-is-still-a-good-oldledger&#34;&gt;The myth of bits: a digital ledger is still a good old ledger
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we are clear on monetary creation — made by bank and nothing more that an input on a ledger — let’s tackle the last myth surrounding money, the one that states that money became 0 and 1, bits stored somewhere on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/1000xcut.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In real life, the nature of money hasn’t changed&lt;/strong&gt;: the good old bank ledger is still authoritative. Its authority comes from the fact that it doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it draws its authority from the whole &lt;strong&gt;political, societal and judiciary system that surround it&lt;/strong&gt;. The way we interact with the ledger (analog or digital) doesn’t reshuffle the decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With credit cards, ATMs, online banking and all the others “innovations”, it might seem like our monetary system evolved. In reality, we’re still very close to our first monetary systems and our modern currencies follow pretty much the same rules as the old ones. &lt;strong&gt;Innovations and changes happened mostly at the interface level: how we interact with the ledger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/coins.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes happened at the monetary creation level, it used to be much simpler and a state matter but the rest didn’t budge much. Our modern currencies share more with the Gold Franc&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - pardon my Frenchness - that we imagine. Disruption has yet to happen on currencies, what we had so far is barely a parade of facelifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-sneak-peak-into-the-real-monetary-innovations&#34;&gt;A sneak peak into the real monetary innovations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed to lay out the groundwork in order to finally reach this point, the most interesting part: how does real monetary innovation looks like? The answer is not as simple as “Bitcoin”, it can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-the-ledgers-governance-mechanism&#34;&gt;Change the ledgers’ governance mechanism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: the current trust placed in our ledgers is due to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reputation of the institutions who handle the monetary systems, be it central banks, private banks or other institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The political, legal and societal framework built around banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general public ignorance of the mechanisms governing currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s not much to hold the whole monetary system afloat; don’t worry, you’re not the only one. Critics have been numerous and early; in the 80s the cypherpunk movement were already looking into alternative currencies to break free from the fiat ones.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiat currencies are intrinsically useless objects that serves a medium of exchanges. They only have value because a government maintain and guarantee it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cypherpunk experimented with digital currencies and eventually lead us to the Bitcoin introduced by Satoshi. With Bitcoin, &lt;strong&gt;the trust in the monetary institutions is no longer required&lt;/strong&gt; (“trustless”). Indeed, in short the idea is as follows: instead of trusting the banks and other institutions to maintain the ledger, why not make that ledger public (=blockchain) and rely on our peers instead? This system also requires the use of cryptography and mechanisms to reach a consensus on the public ledger (so there is only one), but that will be covered in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alter-the-innate-propriety-ofmoney&#34;&gt;Alter the innate propriety of money
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about a currency that depreciates if not used? It would help to keep it circulating. The idea is not new, it was theorised in 1916 already by Silvio Gesell and is called demurrage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a currency depreciating over time might seem scary at first as it contradict our intuitive comprehension of money (“&lt;em&gt;how can it be a store of value if its value shrink over time?”&lt;/em&gt;). We already have already established that this intuitive comprehension of money was far from the truth of the practical world. This kind of money has an evident interest for recessionary phases, as it promotes spending the money quickly and “punishes” hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;limit-what-kind-of-items-money-can-claim-be-claimedupon&#34;&gt;Limit what kind of items money can claim be claimed upon
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without even altering the innate proprieties of money, we can change what it can be exchanged for. Local currencies are a good example of this. If they are designed carefully, this kind of currencies can help revitalize the local economy and independent businesses. Local currencies are plentiful; the Brixton Pound (B£) is one of the most well known. The team behinds it does a pretty good job to explain their thought process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will provide you with a better understanding of money but most importantly that it sparked an interest and it makes you want to learn more about it! The actual monetary innovation has yet to happen. The good news is &lt;strong&gt;now that we have cryptocurrencies, it’s much easier to create new ones&lt;/strong&gt; — pretty much anybody can do it and it’s an excellent news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that all the mechanisms we talked about and many more will be implemented and tested at scale. They already are: there are more than 1500 traded cryptocurrencies and easily another 10 thousands local, confidential or developed for learning purposes. You would like to mint your own coins too?

&lt;p&gt;Beyond what blockchain can offer, maybe here lies the most valuable contribution of Satoshi. &lt;strong&gt;By creating Bitcoin, he paved the way and reminded the whole world that minting money isn’t reserved to states&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s the business of regular people too: you, me, us, and even your computer illiterate grandma should have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all changes, it sounds scary but if you think twice about it, it makes so much sense: &lt;strong&gt;who better than the future users themselves could design the currency the most fitted to their needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to Crypto Bullshit: How to spot a shitcoin?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to invest in an ICO, or get your hands on some already traded coins? Awesome, welcome aboard! Before you jump in, let me give you some clues to spot shaky projects with examples taken from actual ones. These tips come from my experience (and failures) as well the discussion I had both with friends and the cryptocurrency community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-whitepaper-is-always-the-most-insightful-resource&#34;&gt;The Whitepaper is ALWAYS the most insightful resource
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitepapers (WP for the rest of this article) can be scary. While some manage to keep it short (~10 pages), others can reach the hundreds yet it’s the best place to gauge the seriousness of a project. &lt;strong&gt;It’s still the first thing I check once I’m seriously considering a coin&lt;/strong&gt;. So what should you be watching closely in a WP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-englishlanguage&#34;&gt;The English Language
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising? Not so much if you put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;how to trust an organization unable to put out a flawless WP with a decentralized cryptocurrency project?&lt;/strong&gt; It might seem small or even petty, but if you find a low-quality English or repeated typos in the WP, you better start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;big-promises-with-technical-vagueness&#34;&gt;Big Promises with technical vagueness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common, as most people won’t read the technical parts of the whitepaper. Even if you don’t fully get the technical details, the difference between a WP trying to cover its lies and a transparent one are quite apparent. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sficoin.co/white-paper/white-paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SFIcoin is the perfect example of this — DONT INVEST: SCAM&lt;/a&gt;, the full recipe is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big promises that don’t mean anything&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Next Global Paying System”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbacked claims&lt;/strong&gt;: their WP that details the vision, the roadmap, the use cases but doesn’t address AT all the tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, the SFICOIN is just going to be the first leading peer to peer cryptocurrency to manage the high-value instant payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We will be the first to X”&lt;/strong&gt;: massive red flag. There are no certainties in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A WP made by marketers for marketers&lt;/strong&gt; lot of visuals, a lot of work on design but overall it’s empty of real meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok for a WP to get quite technical (here is Stellar’s — XLM), but it’s not OK to cover an absence of technical solution with jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-darwin-awards-of-whitepapers&#34;&gt;The Darwin Awards of Whitepapers
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how does a terrible WP looks like? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://narbonne.io/Narbonne.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Check Narbonne’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been 7 months and I can’t find any worse. Out of the 22 pages, ~18 are spitting copy pasta about the future. Most of the paper is very generic, and so many things in it are so off. I had to pick one so here we go, the comparison between Narbonne, Ether&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;um and Wa&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;es. Yes, you read it right, they can’t even spell Ethereum and Waves properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things need to be debunked in this table, it’s actually a good exercise. Here are a few you do the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bookkeeping at the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;”: I’m not even sure what it means, but I think a project like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://request.network/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Request (REQ)&lt;/a&gt; covers this for Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Mobile Banking”: Hello &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omisego.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OmiseGo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“AI, chatbot, voice control”: strictly no use for the project (an infrastructure for banks) but buzzwords so they had to be here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-does-a-proper-wp-looklike&#34;&gt;How does a proper WP look like?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WP is a &lt;strong&gt;technical document&lt;/strong&gt; usually presenting at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vision for the project / what problem the team is trying to crack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the technical solutions proposed to the problem and why they were chosen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The details of the technical implementation of the chosen solutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credible roadmap for the delivery,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical information about the token: token type, total amount, token mechanisms…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifications for the ICO, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hone your skills, there is nothing better than the OG! I invite you to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;original Bitcoin’s whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; written by Satoshi. You can also check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ethereum’s WP&lt;/a&gt; to remind you that &lt;strong&gt;the design doesn’t have to be fancy&lt;/strong&gt; (it’s a GitHub wiki) if the fundamentals are sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardano’s WPs: split between a “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/philosophy/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;philosophical WP&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/academic-papers/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;academic papers&lt;/a&gt;, I think the team does an outstanding job to make their project intelligible to those interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transactions-per-secondmyth&#34;&gt;The Transactions per second myth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the whitepapers covered, let me address another big chunk of today’s article: the myth of the transactions per second (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;transaction-per-second-a-convenient-lie&#34;&gt;Transaction per second: A convenient lie
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPS doesn’t mean anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt; So why is it so popular? Well, it’s a bit like the GHz for processors: it used to be the only thing advertised. It makes sense in a way, &lt;strong&gt;it gives the impression&lt;/strong&gt; that you have a standard allowing you to compare different processors that are actually not comparable: higher is always better right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. You can have a 32 bit 1 core processor operating at 3.5 GHz and a 64 bits 8 cores processor operating at 2 GHz. Guess which one delivers the most computing power? It’s the second one without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the same for the tokens, except it’s not only the power that matters here. Let me pull &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-decentralization-matters-a-12-min-overview-for-the-layman-6ec572d35af6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a quick reminder from my previous article if you missed it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the TPS is meaningless, it’s almost expected now. Newcomer investors will put significant trust in this very misleading indicator, and most projects advertise a given TPS. Good! It gives you a good sign of how honest they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-tps-to-cut-through-thecrap&#34;&gt;Using TPS to cut through the crap
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider coin A, advertising 1M TPS and coin B advertising 10 TPS. What about the features they support? What about decentralization? What about the team vision? Community support? Simply by looking at the number, I know now that Coin A is bullshit and coin B could be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/nano.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;nano&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current state of the art of tech allows for a maximum of ~10 000 TPS (already huge) without excessive centralization.&lt;/strong&gt; Any coin promising something higher than this is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making compromise on decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@CryptoPeterG/eos-centralization-problem-bd7a392eeed2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The prime example of this EOS&lt;/a&gt; and its 21 block producers that have tremendous power over the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lab scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: you can see some coins advertising crazy TPS, some will even show a test network supporting their claim. The thing to look for is the setup of the test network: usually, it’s just a few nodes. It’s easy to reach a high TPS on a three nodes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets harder and harder as the nodes multiply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking on novel and previously untested technological solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nano.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NANO&lt;/a&gt; uses a new kind of ledger called block-lattice and supports up to 7 000 TPS in ideal conditions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.iota.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt; which uses another radically new solution (the Tangle) currently supports ~800 TPS, but it will scale with user adoption. Those two are the most radical “ledger innovations” there are and the most promising. They are the current state of the art: to me any project advertising TPS over this without an equally radically new technical solution is instantly suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including &lt;strong&gt;off-chain scaling&lt;/strong&gt; solutions in their computation of TPS, which leads back to point one: excessive centralization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including new mechanisms such as sharding&lt;/strong&gt; in their computation. Ethereum which has arguably one of the most robust dev community there is, is still 1 to 2 years away from a live implementation of sharding. How could a bunch of newcomers pull this in 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling this number out of their hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A cryptocurrency development project often starts quite centralized. What matters is that the team have a plan to open up the network progressively. For instance, NEO is quite centralized for now, but now that the infrastructure is sound&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://neo.org/blog/details/4089&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;the team is making moves towards decentralizing more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we conclude, let us dive into the crazy world of ICOs, it’s such a wild west that it deserves another section by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;icos-red-flags-to-lookfor&#34;&gt;ICOs red flags to look for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;huge-discounts-for-earlybirds&#34;&gt;Huge discounts for early birds
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see an ICO offering huge discounts (&amp;gt;30%) on the first phases of the sale that’s usually a recipe for disaster. Indeed, it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the early birds get such a large discount, they have a &lt;strong&gt;strong incentive to dump at ICO price or even a little below&lt;/strong&gt; once the token hit the market: it’s guaranteed free money if they sell fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should the team need such a strong incentive to drive the sale? I see this pattern a lot for &lt;strong&gt;tokens with close to no utility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the two situations above don’t unfold, one is guaranteed: huge discounts push towards a concentration of the tokens in the hand of a few: it attracts whales. Massive discounts are a recipe for &lt;strong&gt;political centralization and governance problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-product-demo-orcode&#34;&gt;No product, demo or code
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big risk with ICOs is that you’re essentially investing on a promise or a vision. Yet some ask for money once they already have a working alpha while some others run straight to the ICO as soon as the WP is ready. The latter is much riskier. If there is an alpha or a demo version available, please do check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a dev, &lt;strong&gt;it’s always insightful to check the GitHub repository of the project.&lt;/strong&gt; GitHub makes it easy to see how active the repository is, even without looking at the code. This method is far from perfect are there are ways to make it look like a repo is active even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-team-doesntmatch&#34;&gt;The team doesn’t match
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are seriously considering investing in an ICO, I urge you to google the most prominent team members. Look at their LinkedIn, their Twitter, their previous companies, etc. If you find inactive profiles, it’s usually a pretty bad sign. You might also find skeletons in the closest, such as one team member who participated in another crypto project that turned out to be a failure or a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Banano, a NANO fork&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low quality or frequency social media presence is also a bright orange flag. These guys will have to market their project, acquire users and partners. If they can’t market themselves, it’s already a shaky start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also very common for ICO scams to advertise a prestigious advisor… that has nothing to do with the project&lt;/strong&gt;. Double check any high profile figure to make sure they are actually involved in the project. If you see Satoshi as advisor, RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;inappropriate-token-distribution&#34;&gt;Inappropriate token distribution
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token distribution chart is usually present in every WP. If it’s not, it’s essentially like “give us your money, and we won’t tell you what we’ll do with it”… RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually looks like a pie chart. The most transparent projects have two: one for the distribution of the tokens, and one covering how the funds will be spent by team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/distribution.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Storm token distribution is pretty good (source)&#34;
	
	
&gt;
Storm token distribution is pretty good (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.stormtoken.com/token-structure-and-ceo-update-bd055860251e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok, even good that the team reserves a share of the token for the development of the project. You have to watch the share allocated to the team: it can range from 10% to 30% for the reasonable projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme of the spectrum, you have coins like Ripple (XRP) for which the team owns ~60% of the total supply. It is a significant risk for token holders: first, it’s an enormous vector of centralization. Besides, it means that &lt;strong&gt;the team can heavily manipulate the price of its coin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A few months ago, facing a backlash against this very centralized distribution, the team put an escrow system in place using a smart contract.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ripple.com/dev-blog/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;55 billions tokens are now placed in escrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and released at the pace of 1 billion per month. It doesn’t change anything to the underlying centralization issue and makes me wonder which kind of team would need $500 million (current price of XRP ~ $0.5) each month for its development/partnership/other. Besides,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;since these tokens are now locked they are not counted in the circulating supply (~39B)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which might reassure investors but is purely misleading. The actual supply is 100B tokens. Personal view: the whole move feels like a marketing stunt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article to provide you with some clues to help you spot unreliable crypto projects. Overall, I hope that you understand by now that &lt;strong&gt;the more you read before investing, the lower the risk will be&lt;/strong&gt;. I advise you NOT TO INVEST IMPULSIVELY. Even if it’s the best project in the world, you can sleep on it, read some more and decide a couple of days later with a fresh outlook if you want in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, let me give you more tricks I use to get a quick idea of the seriousness of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google search &lt;code&gt;site:reddit.com &amp;quot;token name (+scam/shitcoin/issues...)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;: this method allows you to search Reddit for a specific token. If there is a massive red flag on the project, it&amp;rsquo;s usually documented somewhere on Reddit. &lt;em&gt;Additional note: Reddit is getting quite tribal now. The best place to find reliable information on a given token is certainly not the token subreddit. Don&amp;rsquo;t go to /r/Ripple/ if you want an objective perspective on XRP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t trust one single source, always cross them!&lt;/strong&gt; Greedy people are promoting shaky projects all around the internet, never blindly trust just one guy even if he seems to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several services exist to organize the community due diligence on ICOs. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://icocheck.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ICOCheck&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty reliable one, but do your own due diligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: &lt;strong&gt;I strongly recommend you to not invest in ICOs for at least the first year you’ve been invested in cryptos&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of them fail dramatically. You are much better off limiting yourself to the top 25/100/200 tokens depending on the risk you’re willing to take. Even among those, there are many doubtful projects: beware and happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/why-decentralization-matters-a-12-min-overview-for-the-layman/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/decentralisation-layman/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Why decentralization matters? A 12 min overview for the layman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public is hearing more and more about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and cryptocurrencies, the philosophical and political underlying of decentralization are still kept mostly within the community. &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is bringing a paradigm shift that deserves more coverage than price action in my book&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I realized that I didn’t really understood decentralization. I got the high-level concept, but I failed to connect all the dots and &lt;strong&gt;understand the social and political ramifications of it.&lt;/strong&gt; Since then, I’ve done my homework and now it’s time to give back my humble understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Simpsons: Season 16, Episode 19 — Thank God it’s Doomsday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is not an easy change to apprehend. Imagine yourself in the internet early days, let’s say 1995. Could you have thought about all the potential use cases for this new tech and how they were going to unfold? Back then, you even had prominent actors from the tech industry &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;predicting the uselessness or failure of the internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Metcalfe, in InfoWorld, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waring Partridge, in Wired, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to laugh at them now, but ask yourself this question: Aren’t you doing exactly the same thing with decentralized services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first audience for this article are people who read two articles from mainstream medias before concluding that decentralization is stupid. &lt;strong&gt;Let me be the third and the charm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medias are here to promote emotional content that makes you react, so you get your dopamine shot and come back. They are not here to help you learn and grow. They caused their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one am simply a 26 years old French dude with a knack for writing and time on his hand. &lt;strong&gt;I have nothing to sell to you, but simply one goal: help people to realize what’s happening, so they can be part of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested the draft on people aged anything from 20y old to 60+. &lt;strong&gt;It’s foolproof, as long as your willing to lend me 12 minutes of your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll gain a framework allowing you to see decentralization for what it is: the premise of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is hard, scary and confusing. It destroys your previous references and leaves you in a world where you have to re-think everything again. It’s a lot of work to adapt, but the earlier your start, the easiest it is, just like it happened for Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share this piece with your decentralization-sceptic and decentralization-enthusiast friends alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-is-multidimensional-spectrum&#34;&gt;Decentralization is multidimensional spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious to some, but it’s an important fact: &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is a spectrum, not a state&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes from the most centralized systems possible, such as our current fiat monetary systems (&lt;strong&gt;“Central”&lt;/strong&gt; Banks decide pretty much everything) to the most decentralized systems, such as the English language (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here is an interesting infographic giving you an overview of the centralization of major industries:&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Lillian Wei, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-governance-how-decentralized-do-we-need-to-be-799a7988ce84&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you get the spectrum of decentralization, the second thing to understand is the &lt;strong&gt;different dimensions of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is than in absolute, they aren’t any typology of the different dimensions of decentralization. To make things easier, I’m gonna use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgStgMyR9sY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the one proposed by Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder of Ethereum, one of the leading decentralization projects) that features three main dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-architectural-dimension&#34;&gt;1. The Architectural Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This dimension is easy to grasp because about the physical things&lt;/strong&gt;: the devices, the servers, the stuff! The architectural dimension address &lt;strong&gt;the base units of the network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize architectural decentralization, you’ll need to multiply the devices powering your &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, and spread them around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Visualizer: Tangle.glumb.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know how architecturally decentralized a system is, you can ask these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many underlying devices are powering the network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they geographically spread or concentrated in one area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-political-dimension&#34;&gt;2. The Political Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics is about power. This dimension address the &lt;strong&gt;decision making process of the system&lt;/strong&gt;. The most politically centralized protocol is one where a sole decision maker makes all the shots. At the other end of the spectrum, you’ll have many actors and evenly distributed responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/decentralisation-layman/politics.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most politically decentralized systems, the spread between the least influential node and the most influential node is kept to a minimum. The perfectly politically decentralized network would offer the same influence to any node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good questions to determine how politically decentralized a system is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people/groups are involved in the decision making process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the power repartition looks like? What kind of criteria is used to weight each participant influence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they any recourse / appeal mechanisms built in the system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-logical-dimension&#34;&gt;3. The Logical Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logical dimension is by far the hardest of the three to understand. Don’t give up if you don’t get it from the first read! In Vitalik’s terms, it reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your system look like one thing single thing like a singleton or does it look more like an amorphous swarm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this dimension is about the differences between each nodes that compose the network. To maximize logical decentralization, you want them to diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let some fancy words scare you, it’s actually not so hard. Looking at examples really helped me understand this one, so here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A direct democracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture of a direct democracy is quite centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: there are a few places (parliament, chambers, police, military…) that are the nodes of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the architectural centralization, the decision power is spread in a direct democracy so &lt;strong&gt;the protocol is politically decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt; — aka it’s one main “body”. There is only one government enforcing one set of laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nation vs Federation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are architecturally centralized,&lt;/strong&gt; for the same reason than the direct democracy: there are only a few locations/institutions where the action happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are also politically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: the president/assembly/other elected or not officials hold most of the power, without any public oversight. You can’t swap president two years in, you have to wait the full term, even if the president lie, collude with foreign powers, mishandle public money… Hi to the elephant in the room! The federation might be a little less politically centralized than the nation, but it’s quite similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logical dimension is where things get interesting. While &lt;strong&gt;a nation is one unique main “body”, aka logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;, a federation is made of distinct “parts” that acknowledge and preserve their difference while working towards a common goal. Hence the federation is a good example of logically decentralized system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Source: Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The English Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture is very decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the English language as a protocol, a node would be any English speaking person. The good news is they are plenty, they are diverse, and spread all around the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The political dimension of it is also quite decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no single governing body deciding what English is and is not. Yes, there are official institutions publishing English Grammars for instance, but the grammar is not law: you can choose to follow it or not. The actual English, the one linguists study, is not the one depicted in a grammar, it’s the one spoken by all English speaking individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;it’s also very logically decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;. Two English speakers coming from different countries might speak an English that is very different from one another, because of the vocabulary, the emphasis, or even the sentence structure. You have many different kind of English spoken all around the globe: American English, UK English, my beloved Frenglish…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-three-dimensional-decentralization-spectrum&#34;&gt;Using the three dimensional decentralization spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each dimension is mostly independent from one another. &lt;strong&gt;You can have a service at one end of the spectrum for one dimension, and the other end on another&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-study-web-hostingservices&#34;&gt;Case Study: Web Hosting Services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) are the perfect example of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From an architectural perspective, they want their network to be as decentralized as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. As a hosting provider, AWS need to be reliable. To do so, they have many servers so that the redundancy builds resilience. Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;both for performance and security reasons, they have their servers spread all around the world&lt;/strong&gt;. It reduces latency and further increase resilience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, from a political perspective, Amazon has absolute control over the network. They can refuse to serve you, delete your content (if it’s illegal for instance) and the AWS user community no say on their decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Hence, on the political dimension, AWS is close the most centralized end of the spectrum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, on the logical dimension AWS is centralized, it’s a pretty monolithic company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-significant-hassle-than-can-be-worth-thetrouble&#34;&gt;A significant hassle than can be worth the trouble
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re clear on the decentralization spectrum, you might wonder why going through the hassle? Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;decentralized systems tend to be more complex and harder to manage that centralized ones&lt;/strong&gt;: they have many different components, a decision power spread between several parties and an accountability imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-decentralized-systems-efficient-for-computations&#34;&gt;Are decentralized systems efficient for computations?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those requirements weight on the system and slow it down, right? So why go through the hassle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it’s even more than that! It can be hard to find a relevant comparison between centralized and decentralized systems, but the price of computing power is probably the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, the ratio between the cost of the computing power on the Ethereum Word Computer vs a traditional one (ex Amazon EC2) is between roughly one million&lt;/strong&gt;. Scary ratio, right? (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xHiI-G_CQ&amp;amp;t=251s&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Don’t trust me, go here to check&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… yes and no. First, you have to consider how cheap computing power got over the last couple decades. We’re reaching a point where even just $1 spent on AWS represents a tremendous amount of computing power. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; presents the evolution of computing over the last 25 years with neat infographics:&lt;/p&gt;

Hard Disks dramatically increased in capacity while becoming more compact. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well, we’ve got to ask ourselves: does the comparison even makes sense? It can be useful to understand the current state of our tech, but does it tell us anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization&lt;/strong&gt;. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizations-benefits-the-edge-of-thecrowd&#34;&gt;Decentralization’s benefits: The Edge of the Crowd
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, decentralized systems offer a set of unique advantages opening a wide range of use cases. Let’s go through the main advantages one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;efficiency&#34;&gt;EFFICIENCY
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some cases, making a system decentralized is simply the best way to answer your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the physical distribution of post offices is decentralized. It wouldn’t be efficient to have all the post offices in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion that can play a large role for the efficiency of a system: &lt;strong&gt;spare capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider people who already own a resource (let’s say a house or car), but only use it 10% of the time. Instead of having to build a whole new infrastructure for your service, you can use instead the spare capacity that is already available: hello Uber or Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fault-tolerance&#34;&gt;FAULT TOLERANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a decentralized system is redundant (there are no elements that exist only once, all have many “copies”), &lt;strong&gt;the risk of the whole system failing accidentally is much more limited than a centralized system.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s precisely why web hosting services have to be architecturally decentralized. But many systems benefit from fault tolerance: consider the energy production/distribution network for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion quite useful to understand why decentralized system are resilient, it’s the &lt;strong&gt;SPOF. Single Point of Failure&lt;/strong&gt; is a term used in network infrastructure to describe an element than is not redundant: it exists only once. &lt;strong&gt;If this element was to fail, it would bring the whole system down, hence the name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still following, you should be able to connect the dots: since everything is redundant in a an architecturally decentralized system, there are no SPOF. If there is a SPOF, it means that there is a single/central element somewhere (that could break), hence it’s not a decentralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;attack-resistance&#34;&gt;ATTACK RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attack resistance is essentially a matter of cost/benefit. &lt;strong&gt;Unattackable systems don’t exist, what do exist are systems that are simply to costly to attack considering the potential reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider malicious actors that would be looking to damage the protocol not for direct financial benefit, but for something else. Maybe it’s a competitor trying to bring you down? Even in that scenario, the attacker would need to dedicate a lot of resource to have a chance to bring a decentralized system down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact to consider is also that information is spread over many devices. &lt;strong&gt;If an attacker manage to get control over one device, he only gets access to a fragment of the whole dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; It makes the system more resilient to hacks, as the data is less exposed. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.fr/search?q=ashley&amp;#43;madison&amp;#43;hack&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR792FR792&amp;amp;oq=ASHLEY&amp;#43;MADISON&amp;#43;HACK&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3446j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Too bad Ashley Madison wasn’t architecturally decentralized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;collusion-resistance&#34;&gt;COLLUSION RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind collusion resistance is to make it hard for one subgroup of the system to come together and act only for their own best interest, to the detriment of the whole system. The extreme example of collusion would be a monopoly — it lets actor gain an unfair advantage over the whole market and impose its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instance, in our modern democracies, collusion resistance is extremely low&lt;/strong&gt;: the common interest of the system (the betterment of the country) is frequently, some would even say systematically hijacked by specific subgroups (such as businesses) for their own benefits (profits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is a high level concept that is essential to understand blockchain and other decentralized ledgers. If you want to explore further, you can look at videos of founders of the major project explaining their vision to get a better idea of what a decentralized system enable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better understanding of the paradigm shift offered by the newfound ability to develop decentralized protocols at scale, thanks to blockchain. and other decentralized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
