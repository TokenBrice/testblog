        <title>Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/0-lending-protocol-renaissance-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Is this a Lending Protocol Renaissance?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we’ve seen a flurry of novel and exciting lending protocols come to market, such as Morpho, DYAD, Fluid, or Tapioca; even more are expected in the coming months, such as Liquity V2 (Bold) or Euler V2. All are innovative, in the arena, trying things to the point that I wonder if we’re not experiencing a lending protocol renaissance after a few years of rehashing the same concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this article, I’d like to give you a tour of the interesting ideas I’ve seen being explored — we’ll go through some of the protocols mentioned above and, for each, focus on understanding their main innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collateralized-debt-position-cdp-protocols-vs-money-market&#34;&gt;Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocols vs Money Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, starting with a primer on the differences between CDP protocols (e.g., Maker or Liquity) and money markets (e.g., Aave or Morpho). It will come in handy as we will discuss both in this article and even finish with a project merging the two models into one protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDP (ex: Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Market (ex: Aave)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borrower Interest Rate&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Predictable, can even be fixed or initiation fee only&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volatile, entirely dependent on pool usage&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral accepted&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually limited options, cannot mix collateral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various collateral: a given position can mix several collaterals at once&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assets that can be borrowed&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the protocol stablecoin (DAI on Marker, LUSD on Liquity)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse – any asset enabled as a borrowable asset&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral re-hypothecation&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collateral are deposited in a pool and thus potentially re-lent to other users&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol core challenge&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stabilizing the stablecoin outputted &amp; securing enough liquidity on it&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attracting sufficient borrowable assets (USDC, ETH) to fulfill borrowing demand&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol main risk&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ stablecoin death spiral&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle failure ⇒ collateral value not accurately evaluated ⇒ some users can borrow more than their collateral worth ⇒ all borrowable assets are drained&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols stand out for their ability to facilitate cheaper borrowing costs, thereby stimulating more borrowing-side demand, a challenging feat to achieve. This is due to the unique feature of CDPs, where the user directly contracts debt against the protocol, eliminating the need to source and pay an external stablecoin depositor demanding a competitive interest rate, as is the case with a money market like Aave. The primary challenge with CDPs lies in the stability and liquidity of the stablecoin that is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, money markets tend to be more flexible. Thanks to their structure, they allow users to mix and match collateral and can quickly onboard new ones. Yet, they tend to require more maintenance, as collateral parameters must be constantly adjusted to reflect the realities of the market. This creates quite the load for governance, as seen on Aave, where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://boardroom.io/aave/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;over a thousand proposals&lt;/a&gt; were already processed in four and a half years: approximately 22 per month. It works, but it seems overengineered; surely there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dyad-flirting-with-the-endogenous-collateral-taboo&#34;&gt;DYAD: Flirting with the endogenous collateral taboo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyad is a CDP protocol that implements several novel ideas, such as delivering free borrowing to its users, who must own an NFT to partake (Note). It also serves as the protocol&amp;rsquo;s base coordination layer. I invite you to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyad.gitbook.io/dyad-docs-v2/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;read the documentation&lt;/a&gt; to become more familiar with it. Let’s zoom in on Dyad’s novel approach to handling a key topic for CDP protocols: overcollateralization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For stablecoins, we talk about endogenous vs exogenous collateral. To quickly tell, ask yourself this question: if the stablecoin fails, does the collateral also fail? If yes, your collateral is endogenous (ex: my beloved &amp;amp; defunct &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/posts/2021/seigniorage-basis-vs-esd/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage-based stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;); if not, it’s exogenous (ex: ETH for Liquity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins harnessing endogenous or no collateral can scale quickly, as seen with ESD, Basis Cash, or Terra/UST. However, they can and usually do explode even faster. For this reason, harnessing endogenous collateral is considered a risky practice – worthy of an instant Red Flag / F on the stablecoin rating agency &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bluechip.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bluechip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to focus on today regarding Dyad is its utility token, KEROSENE, which is a mechanism for allocating the right to mint against existing surplus collateral in the system. By default, the system&amp;rsquo;s minimal collateralization ratio is 150%. However, KEROSENE holders can deposit it into their Notes to reduce their exogenous collateral ratio to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, KEROSENE is not technically an endogenous collateral but a mechanism to price and enable users to harness the protocol&amp;rsquo;s exogenous over-collateralization. KEROSENE’s utility gives it a “deterministic value” corresponding to its utility while deposited into a Note. Since KEROSENE is mostly farmed by supplying liquidity on DYAD, it could entertain an interesting flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/2-dyad-defillama.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;2-dyad-defillama&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the year, the protocol has seen gentle and steady growth, although still limited. The rollout is progressive: the base functionalities are live (Note, DYAD minting, LP incentives, KEROSENE utility), yet much more is coming: sDYAD, momentum (a mechanism to better align protocol participants), a lending market, etc. It’s worth following for any stablecoin enjoyer such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;liquity-v2--the-base-rate-of-defi&#34;&gt;Liquity v2 – The base rate of DeFi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquity’s LUSD remains one of the most successful genuinely decentralized stablecoins on the mainnet, so when v2 was announced, it gathered a lot of attention. After researching a novel approach harnessing a reserve model, the team pivoted back to a CDP protocol, growing from learning the first iteration. V2 is expected to be released by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to focus on one, in particular, on interest rate management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate management is crucial for all lending protocols, even CDP protocols. The rate can be easily defined based on the market utilization rate in money markets. For CDP protocols, replicating a similar approach is impossible, and other venues must be explored; several were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance-defined (ex: Maker / DAI): while this approach provides flexibility, it generates uncertainty for borrowers and challenges in governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithmic (ex: Liquity / LUSD): no governance is always better, when possible; however, it doesn’t come without shortcomings either. In the case of Liquity, the set initiation fee proved inflexible, which led to the protocol adjusting to a higher interest rate environment with redemptions and, thus, through a lowering of the overall LUSD supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With v2, the protocol switches to an interest rate model (no more initiation fee), which should already provide more agility. What’s more interesting is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/liquity-v2-why-user-set-interest-rates&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how this interest rate is decided: directly by the users&lt;/a&gt;. The team introduces another protocol-level game with straightforward parameters: redemptions will be processed based on the interest rate paid by the user, from lowest to highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, users who choose a very low interest will put themselves first in line for redemptions, while those who pick the highest interest will be maximally protected. To make it easy for any user to partake, interest rate delegation will be possible, with various delegates delivering different mandates expected at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the protocol to rapidly adjust to all kinds of market environments, from low interest rates to high, avoiding the long redemption phases as seen in v1 while remaining immutable and delivering greater predictability to borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/3-bold-stability.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3-bold-stability&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the protocol gains adoption, the average interest rate observed could even inform beyond Liquity v2 itself, as it will correspond to a base rate borrowers are willing to pay on a risk-minimized and immutable protocol. Riskier protocols will have to offer a lower interest rate to attract borrowers. The v2 packs many more interesting innovations. To get up to speed, I recommend checking out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://x.com/bjnpck/status/1772227278606389496&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bojan’s thread of threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tapioca--cdp-x-money-market-convergence&#34;&gt;Tapioca – CDP x Money Market Convergence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapioca was launched just a few weeks ago and is still being progressively released, as some protocol components still need to be made live. In today’s highlight, I’d like to focus on two main items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of the CDP and Money Market model with Tapioca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The innovative token lock model harnessed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in. For more context about Tapioca, as often, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.tapioca.xyz/tapioca&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;convergence-of-cdp-and-money-market&#34;&gt;Convergence of CDP and Money Market
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDP protocols face a challenge: they must deliver competitive yield on the stablecoin they output to drive demand. Liquity v2 will redirect most of the fees collected, thanks to the interest rate, to BOLD stakers, Maker has the DSR / sDAI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, another way to ensure stablecoin minters can access competitive yields is to build a money market on top of the stablecoin: that’s precisely what Tapioca is doing. Indeed, Tapioca is essentially a double protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the CDP—branded “Big Bang,” where users can mint USDO against selected collateral: gas tokens and LSDs. The collateral selection is purposely restrictive, as tokens accepted here directly affect USDO backing. Borrowers pay an interest rate and, depending on USDO’s peg situation, potentially an initiation fee of up to 1% (if underpeg). It enables users to loop-leverage their ETH / LSD exposure or simply harness their ETH / LSD as collateral to borrow some USDO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is the money market — branded “Singularity,” which provides isolated markets where users can supply various types of collateral to borrow USDO, supplied by borrowers on the CDP side. This creates a native yield for USDO holders that is decorrelated from the CDP side, as well as offering an elegant approach to handle all types of collateral:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship resistant majors ⇒ CDP collateral =backing USDO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivatives / more risky tokens ⇒ Singularity = yield to USDO holders without compromising USDO’s backing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual structure allows Tapioca to host various collateral, with appropriate risk-mitigation measures for each. Since singularity harnesses isolated markets, the risk for each collateral onboarded there is isolated, and it can be further managed with its parametrization (LTV, interest rate, and liquidation bonus) and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twaml-an-innovative-token-locking-model&#34;&gt;twAML: an innovative token-locking model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After following and commenting on the DEX evolutions, starting with veCRV and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/crv-vs-velo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the improvements we observed with Velodrome (veNFT)&lt;/a&gt;, I anticipated seeing token lock models harnessed on lending protocols too. It has been, but only in a primitive manner, with gauge-based emissions &amp;amp; governance token locking to allocate them, such as seen on Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca finally delivers with an exciting approach harnessing a new type of token locking (twAML), both for their governance token TAP and for the suppliers of the money market, to secure the supply side and thus drive more borrowing demand. Hence, after Velodrome improved the veCRV model and delivered the first credible improvement over veCRV, we might see its third iteration come to fruition. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td colspan=&#34;4&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Locking Model Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depends on twAML – the average lock duration of other lockers: if equal/above, then one veTKN per TKN&lt;/em&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, linear over time (ex, after 2 years of lock, only 0.5 veTKN per TKN)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;same as veCRV&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Decay&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weekly rebase added to veNFT&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fees from pool voted on&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential bribes&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Interest Accrued &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquidation Profit Shares&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDO Creation Fees&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Mint Fee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main innovation lies in the flexibility and additional game theory layer this model implements. Instead of a linear veTKN to TKN correspondence, depending on the time locked and maxing at four years, like with veCRV and veAERO, twAML looks at other lockers&amp;rsquo; average lock time (magnitude weighted). In practice, achieving a 1:1 TKN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;veTKN correspondence no longer requires a four-year lock but simply to lock for as much / longer than the existing locks. Thus, the lock time will rapidly increase during the first epoch, ramping up from the 4-week maximum initially set up until it finds an equilibrium point and potentially starts to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/lending-protocol-renaissance/4-twTAP.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;4-twTAP&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released for the first time with dynamic adjusting, the twAML was met with excessive degeneracy and quickly ramped up over four years. Thus, the team has returned to work and switched the adjustment to epoch-based. The new iteration is expected in the coming weeks, another development worth monitoring for stablecoin and lock tokens enjoyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapioca is quite the beefy protocol, two years in the work. I’ve barely scratched the surface there, as there are many other components worthy of commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s natively omnichain harnessing Layer 0&amp;rsquo;s omnichain fungible token standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapioca, like Liquity, will be one of the few CDP protocols redirecting fees generated from stablecoin minting to its token holders through the twTAP model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewards for USDO lockers are distributed in oTAP, an option token connected to the twAML logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protocol is keen on accruing Protocol-Owned Liquidity, both for TAP and USDO, which will enable it to lower its liquidity maintenance costs and potentially turn it into a profitable endeavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cover more protocols, but this article is already beefy, so I’ll keep it there for today. There are many exciting developments for lending protocols worth discussing, such as the growth of isolated markets with protocols like Morpho or Silo. All of this and more leads me to believe that after years of Aave &amp;amp; Maker dominating the lending protocol landscape, we might see some challengers rising to a similar size, if not overtaking them in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be watching, and so should you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Gray for the cover image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/stablecoin-marauder-map/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/stablecoin-marauder-map-cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Maurauder&#39;s Map of Decentralized Stablecoins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild new stablecoins are constantly appearing, and with the multiplication of chains, layers, and viable stablecoin models the trend is not stopping anytime soon. &lt;strong&gt;Navigating the stablecoin landscape is turning into a critical skill for DeFi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized stablecoin models are easier to evaluate, decentralized stablecoins harness various complex mechanisms, making it harder to compare their data face to face. Yet, dozens of relevant new decentralized stablecoins are appearing yearly, and I don’t expect the trend to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, this article intends to provide a marauder map to help navigate the landscape of decentralized stablecoin designs. Before combing through the innovations for decentralized stablecoins, allow one more minute to the context: why do we care so much about (decentralized) stablecoins in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;size-matters&#34;&gt;Size matters
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins are cryptocurrency’s top product-market fit by a wide margin&lt;/strong&gt;. DeFi is cool, right? We love it on this blog. Yet size-wise, there are about 3 times more value locked in stablecoins than in DeFi protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the total TVL in DeFi is around $38B for $124B of stablecoins circulating, serviced mainly by centralized options: USDT makes 66% of the total, and USDC is another 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dive in! As we consider the various designs harnessed to deliver decentralized stablecoins, I’ll illustrate the mechanisms discussed using examples from live projects: picture this article as recipe book meets marauder map on the topic of decentralized stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-build-a-decentralized-stablecoin&#34;&gt;HOW TO BUILD A DECENTRALIZED STABLECOIN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a virtually infinite range of designs that can be harnessed to output decentralized stablecoins; however, they all rely on two essential core needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Price Stabilization&lt;/strong&gt; | Finding an effective way to stabilize the stablecoin price without too much compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoin Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; | The active management of the liquidity on the stablecoin to maximize its effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both themes address the same need: ensuring that the stablecoin can be traded at peg whatever the circumstances, they operate on different time frames. Stabilization mechanisms are built so that stablecoins tend to their peg over the mid/long time-frames. Liquidity strategies are here to ensure even sizable amounts of the stablecoin can be bought/sold as close as possible to the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are two prerequisites for a stablecoin design to be relevant and have a chance at gathering traction. Faults on those two dimensions jeopardize the whole design, so let’s look at the leading price stabilization mechanisms harnessed and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;price-stabilization-mechanisms&#34;&gt;PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISMS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with sizable demand, decentralized stablecoins can depeg - that is, divert from the peg, usually $1, either upwards or downwards. While similar, the two depegs stem from vastly different design challenges. Let’s start with the most common, the depeg when a $ stable is worth less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;underpegging-illustrated-with-gho&#34;&gt;Underpegging illustrated with GHO
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually happens when the stablecoin is mainly used for leverage and lacks significant direct use cases – &lt;strong&gt;a current prime example is Aave’s GHO, trading around $0.97&lt;/strong&gt;. GHO is one of the cheapest stablecoins to borrow (1.5% max APY), creating a lot of initial demand for it. Yet, there is not much to do with GHO directly apart from providing liquidity. Thus, many borrowers swap their GHO for something else, for instance, DAI, to harness the 5% yield from the DSR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the AaveDAO has been slow to take action to support GHO. Despite the stablecoin being live since mid-July, there are still very few incentives directed to growing GHO’s liquidity, and they are poorly allocated as most of them focus on stableswap pools where GHO is overweight because of its price. Since these pools are 80% composed of GHO, they provide little adequate liquidity at the current price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/gho-balancer-pool.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;gho-balancer-pool&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the only pressure for GHO to repeg comes from the existing borrowers who could consider repaying their debt with a ~3% discount if they could borrow and swap GHO around $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GHO will need attractive earning options directly available in GHO to approach the peg again, such as liquidity-providing options. Still, a GHO-based staking module with revenue sharing would fit the task nicely. Overall, we need more GHO-sinks: mechanisms resulting in GHO being minted and held as such for long periods. Right now, it seems like governance is pushing forward increased support for GHO’s liquidity incentives and a potential GHO PSM (Peg Stability Module): more on this design is below while we address Maker/DAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was launched a few weeks ago, most of GHO’s current challenges come from its young age, coupled with a lack of preparation for the launch on the DAO side. The DAO is improving in that regard, with many propositions pushed forward to address the situation, including establishing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a liquidity committee for GHO&lt;/a&gt; I should contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overpegging-illustrated-with-lusd&#34;&gt;Overpegging illustrated with LUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/liquity/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Liquity&lt;/a&gt; utilizes a unique mechanism called Redemptions to maintain its price stability. In Liquity, users deposit their ETH as collateral to borrow and mint stablecoins (LUSD). The key innovation lies in the redemption mechanism, which enables users to redeem LUSD for the underlying collateral (ETH) at a fixed ratio, even if the market price of ETH drops significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism incentivizes users to stabilize the price of LUSD by redeeming it when ETH prices are low, thereby reducing the circulating supply of LUSD and supporting its peg to the USD. It provides &lt;strong&gt;immediate and immutable access to LUSD’s collateral to LUSD holders&lt;/strong&gt; without the need for liquidity on a decentralized exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemptions provide an additional layer of guarantee to LUSD holders but add complexity on the borrowing side, pushing borrowers to monitor and adjust their LTV against other protocol users and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral redemptions provide the most direct access to the underlying backing of a stablecoin. Centralized stablecoins like USDC or USDT use a similar, although permissioned, mechanism to enable redeemability to USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD traded at a premium for most of its existence, even though the situation has improved recently. Indeed, several factors contributed to enhancing the liquidity and the peg pressure: the success of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chickenbonds.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chicken Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, advanced liquidity strategies on novel DEXes like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mav.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, or the accumulation of LUSD by DAOs and treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The why of the premium still needs to be pinpointed precisely. One of the likely main factors is that &lt;strong&gt;LUSD is servicing a unique niche&lt;/strong&gt;, the resilience-maximized stablecoin, where there is usually more demand (people wanting to hold LUSD) than offer (ETH holders borrowing LUSD and selling it). &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency#:~:text=LUSD%20is%20a%20stablecoin%20fully,also%20comes%20with%20scalability%20challenges.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This topic was covered in depth last year on Liquity’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While underpegging is usually more concerning, overpegging can have real consequences, too, as it can make effective borrowing costs less predictable for the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUSD’s overpeg stems from mostly psychological mechanisms: the worst case of sustained overpegging was observed during movements of market panic, especially when a prominent centralized stablecoin is perceived at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, thanks to its resilience, LUSD is seen as a &lt;strong&gt;safe haven stablecoin&lt;/strong&gt;. A remarkable feat, but it comes with a price: crowds rush to LUSD when other stablecoins are at fault, such as when USDC depegged 10% following the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank. LUSD saw an incredible trading volume that day, with sizeable purchases above $1.03, $1.04, and $1.05 as the market panicked. Amid the panic, some users are willing to pay a high price to fly to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dai-and-the-psm-solving-overpegging-for-a-price&#34;&gt;DAI and the PSM: solving overpegging, for a price
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its early days, before the Mutli Collateral Dai update, DAI had similar challenges to LUSD: it tended to overpeg. With the update, Maker introduced the Peg Stability Module (PSM) to manage the price stability of its stablecoin DAI. The PSM acts as a buffer between the market and the DAI ecosystem. It allows users to swap stable assets like USDC for DAI at a fixed exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the exchange rate in response to market dynamics, MakerDAO can influence the supply of DAI in the market and keep its price close to the USD peg. It helped MakerDAO resolve the DAI problem over pegging, observed before the PSM. Still, it came with a cost: an accumulation of USDC and other centralized stablecoins as DAI’s collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fraxs-amo-algorithmic-market-operations-scale-liquidity-and-risk-to-infinity&#34;&gt;FRAX&amp;rsquo;s AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations): scale liquidity and risk to infinity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRAX is a decentralized stablecoin that utilizes Algorithmic Market Operations to maintain its peg. FRAX employs an adaptive mechanism that adjusts its collateralization ratio based on market conditions. When the FRAX price trades above its peg, the system mints new FRAX and buys back collateral, increasing the stability of the peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the FRAX price falls below the peg, it reduces the collateralization ratio to encourage users to mint FRAX, which helps restore the peg. AMOs come with additional risks, mainly depending on the usage of the assets minted without collateral: the riskier their exposure, the bigger the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal risks of such a design manifest when an issue with one of the services harnessed (usually money markets or DEX) arises. Say 10M FRAX are minted by the AMO and deposited into a money market to be borrowed by users. Now, the money market suffers an issue with one of its collateral and gets drained: there are now 10M more FRAX in open circulation with 0 collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigating this requires very active management of the AMOs - by humans, through a multisig, which is not ideal from a security perspective, as AMOs can mint FRAX at will with no backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crvusd-pegkeeper-a-better-psm&#34;&gt;crvUSD pegKeeper: a better PSM?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the peg-stability of crvUSD, Curve explored a path similar to the PSM, but slightly improved. Indeed, here, the need for users’ input is removed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker PSM, it’s still user-driven: when overpeg, users supply USDC as collateral to Maker PSM and mint DAI, helping to push its price back. If DAI was to underpeg, users could similarly buy DAI (below $1) to redeem it for 1 USDC, helping to restore its price to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crvUSD works similarly at a high level (if crvUSD&amp;gt;$1 =&amp;gt; mint, if crvusd&amp;lt;$1 =&amp;gt; burn) but does not require any input: the system stabilizes itself thanks to its pegKeepers contract. These special contracts can mint non-collateralized crvUSD under certain conditions and for specific use cases only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 pegKeepers, each plugged into a different pool of crvUSD paired against a redeemable centralized stablecoin: USDC. USDT, USDP &amp;amp; TUSD. When crvUSD is overpeg, they can mint crvUSD to trade into the associated pool, helping to push crvUSD price back to $1. When crvUSD is underpeg, the pegKeeper can repurchase crvUSD on their associated pool (using centralized stable balances accumulated during overpeg) and burn it to push crvUSD’s price back to peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, pegKeepers accumulate a crvUSD debt to the protocol when the stablecoin is overpegged, to be ideally resorbed once crvUSD is underpeg. The key here lies in the balance, ensuring that the spread between the supply of crvUSD (incl. Pegkeeper debt) and the borrowed supply does not grow too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/pegkeeper.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;pegkeeper&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pegKeepers still pose a decent threat to the protocol, just like the FRAX’s AMO or Maker’s PSM, the risk seems more mitigated there. Yet, crvUSD is still quite a young stablecoin, and only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-management&#34;&gt;LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management, even just for a stablecoin, could be a good topic for a thesis. It’s one of the most misunderstood topics across the space. I wanted you, dear reader, to be aware of its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;liquidity-management-as-a-non-topic&#34;&gt;Liquidity management as a non-topic
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read this blog, you’ve likely already internalized that &lt;strong&gt;liquidity strategies are the heart of the storm of the stablecoin wars.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet, many teams have yet to attain this realization. They picture it as something of low criticality that the DAO will handle later, which is incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DAOs are not the best structure to manage liquidity, they tend to harness suboptimal solutions, overpay, and simply need more velocity to match the fast pace of the liquidity games. No surprise here; we’ve already established ages ago that &lt;strong&gt;DAOs/governance are a good fit for strategical (long-term) orientations but inapt at mid/short term (tactics) management,&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to the example of MakerDAO (where, despite the absurdity of it, MKR holders are still voting on the vault’s interest rate, a purely operational parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution would be for the DAO to &lt;strong&gt;appoint a liquidity committee&lt;/strong&gt; - a small team of liquidity specialists provided with a budget they can mobilize autonomously. The committee could be hired for a set term, while the DAO retains the right not to renew the committee or even revoke it similarly to other service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to look at the main stablecoin projects run by DAOs and see which one has a committee yet. As far as I know, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;only Aave is finally considering it for GHO&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the increased agility and operational capacity provided by the committee, it also enables the DAO to be more structured and forward-planning in its liquidity approach, allowing it to explore partnerships and collaboration with more relevant actors, such as supporting an innovative DEX from day one at launch, instead of the many months required to explain the relevancy of the innovation to the DAO’s stakeholders and have a budget being voted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;competence-is-scarce&#34;&gt;Competence is scarce
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard truth about liquidity management is that competence is extremely scarce. This could explain why the topic needs to be better understood and rarely prioritized at the project&amp;rsquo;s design stage or later in the governance discussions. An apt liquidity manager must have an accurate understanding of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base liquidity structure model, x*y=k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom liquidity structures like stableswap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic concentrated liquidity, UNIv3 style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap liquidity management layer (Bunni, Merkl, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CL liquidity manager model (Gamma, Arrakis, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veCRV tokenomics &amp;amp; ecosystem // veBAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote marketplaces and bribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced concentrated liquidity, Maverick style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick incentives model (Boosted Pool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick tokenomics (veMAV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEX Aggregator landscape and pathing logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scope of tools, services, and protocols used for liquidity management is increasing exponentially, and very few actors are following closely&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s frequent to observe absurd spreads between the liquidity spending of two similar projects, with sometimes spreads of several orders of magnitude of difference in terms of $ invested / results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-attract-piles-of-ethlsds-onchain&#34;&gt;How to attract piles of ETH&amp;amp;LSDs onchain?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we focused on stablecoins harnessing the CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) model, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, where users must deposit collateral to contract debt directly against the protocol (every borrower on a CDP protocol mints their “own” debt). It’s an elegant design that enables the protocol to implement various devices to absorb the volatility of the collateral, thus maximizing the price inertia of the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-limits-of-cdp-based-stablecoin&#34;&gt;The limits of CDP-based stablecoin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet, CDP-based stablecoins come with one main downside: the over-collateralization requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to dampen the volatility of collateral such as ETH without any margin of error. For instance, on Liquity, the minimum collateralization ratio tolerated is 110%, yet the average ratio observed on the protocol is 226.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcollateralization is the central limit of the CDP model, and is hard to overcome. Indeed, lowering the collateralization requirement could attract more borrowers, increasing the risk scope of the stablecoin outputted. Thus, scaling a CDP-based stablecoin is a tough job. There are other relevant ideas to attract more borrowers, such as diversifying the collateral offering, as shown below. But here again, it comes with increased risks on the stablecoin, as seen with DAI, which observed a sizeable collateral degradation over the last years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, many projects are exploring approaches that could result in a stablecoin with fewer compromises than DAI while achieving a similar scale. Let’s consider a few directions currently explored to scale decentralized stablecoin further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;expand-the-collateral--chain-offering-liquity-forks&#34;&gt;Expand the collateral &amp;amp; chain offering: Liquity forks
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023 is the year of the Liquity fork: many protocols were launched this year, harnessing a model more or less similar to Liquity, with some twists. These include Gravita, Prisma, Lybra, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;gravita&#34;&gt;Gravita
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gravita&lt;/a&gt;, probably the closest to the base Liquity model. Here, the focus is put on making the protocol more attractive to borrowers, with several welcome additions, including the possibility of borrowing using liquid staked ETH like stETH or rETH as collateral or the protocol being made available on L2 like Arbitrum. Of course, it’s a game of balance here, as the rule specified above still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice note&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#note-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conditions enforced on the borrowers dictate the guarantees provided to stablecoin holders&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;prisma-finance&#34;&gt;Prisma Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://prismafinance.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Prisma Finance&lt;/a&gt; is also exploring a similar approach, another Liquity fork enabling the usage of ETH-LSD as collateral, built by a team close to the Curve/Llama ecosystem. Components of the veTokenomics are also envisioned on the fee-sharing/governance token PRISMA, but they still need to be made live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lybra-finance&#34;&gt;Lybra Finance
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://lybra.finance/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lybra&lt;/a&gt;, experimented with a lock/escrow model on their governance token LBR. While it seems to have initially worked nicely to attract a sizeable amount of capital, the challenge with such tactics is to sustain them over time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;dyad&#34;&gt;DYAD
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dyadstable.xyz/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DYAD&lt;/a&gt;. This one is technically not a Liquity-fork per se, but more of a Liquity-inspired protocol, especially regarding the price stabilization mechanism of their stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge they are trying to solve is onboarding new collateral on a live CDP protocol without expanding the risk scope of the base protocol more than it needs to. To do so, DYAD introduces a &amp;ldquo;Social Licensing Layer,&amp;rdquo; essentially the governance layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it looks like none of the governance we&amp;rsquo;re used to: here, there is no governance token, so that it won&amp;rsquo;t be your usual plutocracy. Instead, governance power lies directly within the dNFT needed to use the protocol:  each dNFT gets to control a single &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; for each proposed collateral type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can change the position of this switch at any time from off to on or on to off and back again, as often as they want. A given collateral can comprise part of DYAD&amp;rsquo;s collateral basket if it maintains a 2/3 supermajority of &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; switches. The only way to increase your governance power is to control more dNFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYAD also gets bonus points for preserving immutability as much as possible. While the protocol can be changed since it can onboard new collateral, the whole governance layer is immutable. DYAD is not fully live yet, only dNFTs are, but I&amp;rsquo;m eager to see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping with the majors here: LSDfi was all the rage a few months ago, and we’ve seen many protocols providing options to leverage ETH-LSD launching lately. While this sub-market is likely already crowded, there’s room for a CDP-based model delivering a stablecoin slightly less resilient than LUSD but with additional features. The question is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-gentle-with-your-borrowers-llamacrvusd&#34;&gt;Be gentle with your borrowers: LLAMA/crvUSD
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to create a sink for ETH/ETH-LSD: make the conditions more attractive to borrowers / soften the liquidation penalties. Indeed, one of the main innovations behind crvUSD lies with the liquidation model that differs vastly from other services providing leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLAMA (Lending Liquidating AMM Algorithm) replaces the usual liquidations with “soft liquidations”, where underwater borrowers are rebalanced across “bands,” each representing a different price segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides a sizeable protection against liquidations stemming from brutal but unsustained market movements. Instead of the sudden liquidations we’ve been used to, LLAMA&amp;rsquo;s soft liquidations are more gradual, as the collateral is progressively adjusted in proportion to its market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-it-rain-dai-saving-rate--variants&#34;&gt;Make it rain: Dai Saving Rate &amp;amp; variants
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why even bother improving your design when there are more direct paths forward? MakerDAO pioneered this idea of offering a “risk-free” yield to stablecoin holders to drive the demand: the DAI Saving Rate, currently at 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustaining it proves very costly for the DAO, which is increasingly pushed towards riskier but more lucrative collateral to keep afloat. A sizeable share of the collateral are now real-world assets (RWA) managed by custodians, some of which are slow or even fail to meet their yield or reporting obligations or simply sub-optimal (MakerDAO is currently earning 3% on its USDC while &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-raises-usdc-interest-rate-to-5/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;retail can score 5% with Circle&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, surprise, surprise: incentives work, at least at first. Thus, this brutal, low effort, and poorly efficient design over the long term is now spreading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirror.xyz/0xa486d3a7679D56D545dd5d357469Dd5ed4259340/1qSAAQtVdNCW_xn9cObEjwrQzFpwEshNrm0sjX0nkG8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Raft launched a similar concept at 6%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frax is also working on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-2xx-sfrax-governance-proposal/2585&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sFRAX / Frax Saving Rate targeting 5%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/maker-dsr-impact.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;maker-dsr-impact&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, time will tell for the impact of such design over the long run. The way I see it, these protocols are &lt;strong&gt;depleting most of their revenues to pay for acquisition on an ongoing basis&lt;/strong&gt; — they will lose most of the users acquired with DSR the minute they stop. They would have burned a massive amount of money to sustain the charade, money that could have been spent on strategic assets providing life-long incentives to the liquidity providers of their stablecoin, for instance. &lt;strong&gt;This design is a great tactic but one of the most short-sighted strategies I have ever seen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-shift-to-reserve-backed-stablecoin&#34;&gt;A shift to reserve-backed stablecoin?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shift is brewing! While CDP-based models, such as Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer, are flourishing, &lt;strong&gt;reserve-backed stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; are also getting increasingly considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as we highlighted above, there is an inherent tension in purely borrow–based / CDP stablecoins. To put it simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling a decentralized lending-based stablecoin requires attracting and retraining a sizeable amount of ETH / ETH-LSDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the more permissive the protocol is to borrowers, the less desirable the stablecoin its output will become.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of a CDP-based stablecoin depends entirely on its users&amp;rsquo; actions. Under the reserve model, the protocol directly manages the reserve and minting of stablecoins instead of individual positions. Thus, reserve-based models seem to offer a credible answer to CDP-based stable shortcomings, enabling the stablecoin supply to potentially scale more thanks to the native protocol reserve providing increased price inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s summarize this article by examining two prime examples of implementing a reserve-backed stablecoin model. I’ll keep it short and digestible and add resources for diving further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fx-leverage-with-no-fundind-costs--90-volatility-dampened-eth&#34;&gt;f(x): leverage with no fundind costs &amp;amp; 90% volatility dampened ETH
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;F(x) is a fascinating protocol freshly released! It’s a dual product, enabling stETH depositors to expose themselves to two types of assets in the proportion they desire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xETH: a “high-volatility leveraged ETH”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fETH: a “low-volatility floating stablecoin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to a CDP protocol, users deposit ETH (or stETH) to mint fETH or xETH. However, unlike Liquity/Maker/Other CDP, the user does not manage its position (a Trove). Instead, the protocol directly manages the stETH reserve. A redemption feature enables holders of fETH or xETH to reclaim the underlying stETH. However, how much they redeem depends on the system&amp;rsquo;s state, most notably its Net Asset Value: the overall value of stETH in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/stablecoin-marauder-map/protocolfx.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;protocolfx&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched just a few weeks ago, the protocol is still in its early stages with about 1300 ETH of TVL, and the liquidity on fETH is still being worked on. A third token, FXN, the governance token of the protocol, is also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition of both xETH and fETH is relevant to me and should be met with demand once the protocol is more mature. In my view, along with crvUSD, it’s one of the most exciting releases we got stablecoin-wise this year: I’m just waiting for the right time to experiment-ape into xETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquity-v2-protected-lsd-leveraging&#34;&gt;Liquity v2: protected LSD leveraging
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Liquity v2” (codename) is not live yet but has been &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zps__IMxtTs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;introduced by Robert Lauko at the last Stable Summit in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fETH, v2 will offer non-liquidatable leverage on ETH-LSD with no funding fee and even add downside protection. The novel, reserve-backed stablecoin the protocol will output is optimized for scaling. Its liquidity needs are also minimized since the protocol acts as a primary AMM for the stablecoin: users can mint and redeem the stablecoin for $1 of staked ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V2 is being built in public: if you’d like to learn more about it or even get involved, make sure to come by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/RCRp2CJR2S&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity management is the nerve of the stablecoin wars: observe &amp;amp; analyze the strategies deployed by the projects you monitor – their effectiveness is one of the main drivers of the success of the underlying protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉️ TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Follow the event surrounding GHO’s liquidity management on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://governance.aave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 01:13:50 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/maverick-liquidity-shaping/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Staying Ahead of the Curve: the shift from Liquidity Mining to Liquidity Shaping" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since Maverick is out, and a few days since the MAV token joined the fray. Yet, most of DeFi is still scratching its head regarding how Maverick delivers 2-3x the capital efficiency of its top competitor, Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the time was right for a deep dive into the innovations brought by the model and the new paradigm it fosters regarding liquidity management: &lt;strong&gt;liquidity shaping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovations-on-dex-more-like-tools-for-lp-to-express-themselves&#34;&gt;Innovations on DEX? More like tools for LP to express themselves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a decentralized exchange can innovate at two levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure&lt;/strong&gt;: the options offered to liquidity providers to design the supply activity that best matches their thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And/or &lt;strong&gt;the incentivization model&lt;/strong&gt;: the tools and modalities enabling DAOs &amp;amp; projects to incentivize customized or not liquidity structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most new DEX being released recycle an existing infrastructure and focus on innovating on only one dimension - usually the incentivization model - as seen recently with the wave of Solidly/Velodrome forks - &lt;strong&gt;[ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?](&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2023/solidly-velodrome-template.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a few critical moments in the industry when a new DEX was released and provided &lt;strong&gt;critical innovation on both fronts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Uniswap V1/V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; established a solid infrastructure for &lt;code&gt;x*y=k&lt;/code&gt; pools &amp;amp; basic incentivization model: 30 bps fees auto compounded &amp;amp; the possibility of having Liquidity Mining programs on the staked LP tokens (ERC20).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curve&lt;/strong&gt; provided an innovative and efficient liquidity model for pegged assets (stableswap) while pioneering a ve/gauge-based model for liquidity provider incentivization introducing a revenue capture at the token level (admin fee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/uniswap-v3/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UniswapV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; delivered the tools to manage a more advanced liquidity structure harnessing concentrated liquidity efficiently and providing more flexibility fee-wise (1, 5, 30, 100 bps fees, not auto-compounded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally came &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/maverick-v2/ethereum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which goes even further than UniswapV3 in the customization of the liquidity structure it provides, offers streamlined position management (native rebalancing) and an unprecedented level of control regarding incentivization options, marking the birth of a new paradigm: liquidity shaping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each core innovations &lt;strong&gt;enable more expressivity for LPs: they get access to increasingly refined and customized tools enabling even the most intricate thesis to find a proper medium to be expressed onchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, before diving into the depth of liquidity shaping, some pointers on Maverick are necessary. Indeed, to fully understand the impact of liquidity shaping on Maverick, you first need to master its liquidity structures and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-liquidity-structures&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S LIQUIDITY STRUCTURES
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of Maverick&amp;rsquo;s critical innovations is its liquidity structures, enabling the exchange to reach an unprecedented level of capital efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick offers four options to LP that could be regrouped into two categories for simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static mode is similar to a UNIv3 liquidity providing across a custom range, with &lt;strong&gt;immensely more flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And three dynamic modes offer &lt;strong&gt;various flavors of rebalancing to LP&lt;/strong&gt; to optimize further their earning: left (follows price to the left), right (follows price to the right), and both (follows price both ways).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-mavericks-static-mode-is-a-game-changer&#34;&gt;Why Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Static Mode is a game changer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many still have to understand how much of an improvement Maverick&amp;rsquo;s static mode is over UNIv3, so let us focus on it for a minute. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick table recapping the main difference to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Uniswap v3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Maverick Static Pools&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supply liquidity in an arbitrary custom range, even potentially only with one token&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Support an uneven liquidity distribution within that range&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports customized fees and width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 fees tiers, 1 width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Near-infinite fee/width tiers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports the creation of ERC-20-wrapped LP tokens to ease LP onboarding &amp;amp; incentivization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ (Boosted Pools)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the distribution of rewards (Liquidity Mining)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports natively the weighted &amp;amp; customized distribution of rewards to LP (Liquidity Shaping)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like UniswapV3, Maverick supports supplying liquidity in &lt;strong&gt;an arbitrary custom range,&lt;/strong&gt; even potentially only with one token, for instance, an LP on ETH/USDC from $2000 to $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the current price is below $2000 (at the time of writing: $1900), the LP will be supplied purely with ETH and progressively rebalances to USDC as the price moves upwards, ending entirely in USDC at $2400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-univ3.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about LPs that have an even more refined thesis? What about the LP that sees ETH in that range for a week but mainly in the $2150-2250 area? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice for him to be able to express this thesis through the liquidity structure he chooses? It is precisely what Maverick enables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;eth-lp-mav.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot above, you see a distribution from $2000 to $2400 on the ETH/USDC pair; however, &lt;strong&gt;unlike Uniswap, which necessarily distributes liquidity evenly across the range, Maverick enables LPs to choose&lt;/strong&gt;. To better fit our LP thesis, most of the liquidity is concentrated over the three ticks covering the $2150-2250 price zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maximizing-the-expressivity-offered-to-lps&#34;&gt;Maximizing the expressivity offered to LPs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expressivity offered to LP on Maverick is virtually infinite. I expect to see some interesting use cases emerge soon, especially for the protocols that will harness Maverick from the get-go (&amp;ldquo;Maverick-native&amp;rdquo; protocols). For instance, y&lt;strong&gt;ou could envision Maverick as a price stabilization mechanism for a stablecoin or a pegged asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the stablecoin project controls some liquidity, it could supply it in very expressive ways in times of need to constraint the price range. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;buy wall&amp;rdquo; liquidity structure on LUSD: the whole liquidity of this LP is supplied on a single tick, the first one where LUSD is worth below 1.00 USDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-buy-wall.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a current price &amp;gt;1.00 USDC, this LP is supplied 100% in USDC and acts like a buying reserve: if the price of LUSD falls, the LP will rebalance. Such positions are promising, as they can exert buy/sell pressure helping to better constrain peg assets within narrower ranges, which massively reduces the cost of their liquidity incentivization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-the-dynamic-modes&#34;&gt;What about the dynamic modes?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick dynamic modes offer a convenient and easy solution for LPs who maximize their exposure to market prices to maximize the volume processed. All three modes essentially harness the same structure but give different options to LP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price just one way (left or right) - there are tons of pairs where it makes a lot of sense, like wstETH/ETH (wstETH being &amp;ldquo;up-only&amp;rdquo; against ETH thanks to the staking yield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the price both ways, a good match for LP looking to maximize adequate liquidity and fees collected at the expense of increased IL risk on the principal. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly suited for stable and pegged asset pairs, but not only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;mav-both.gif&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to understand here is that &lt;strong&gt;Maverick delivers native rebalancing to its LP&lt;/strong&gt;, and here again, it goes above and beyond what preceded in terms of customization options. &amp;ldquo;Native&amp;rdquo; is the keyword here, meaning the rebalancing can be &lt;strong&gt;done cleverly and gas-efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. While this is not new by itself, here again, the devil lies in the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Curve, LPs have no options: their liquidity is concentrated, but all LPs of a given pair are under the same regime. It eases the management, but kills the expressivity. With Uniswap, LPs can dynamically rebalance their position using third-party tools like Arrakis; it comes with sizable trust assumptions, potential fees, and hefty gas costs. It allows more expressivity but requires more active management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are some limits to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s liquidity rebalancing, based on a TWAP and with some delays to avoid manipulations, it remains a crucial tool to help LPs maximize the time effectively spent in range / in the current price tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mavericks-incentivization-model-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;MAVERICK&amp;rsquo;S INCENTIVIZATION MODEL: LIQUIDITY SHAPING
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the first fundamental innovation brought by Maverick - the unprecedented expressivity offered to LP in the design and management of their position - we can now explore Maverick&amp;rsquo;s second leg: its novel incentivization model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story here is both short and long. &lt;strong&gt;In short, Maverick provides the same level of customization at the incentivization layer as at the pool creation level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads us to a longer story, with examples to be more explicit. Replicating most existing liquidity structures and incentivization models on Maverick is possible. But what&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting are the new ones previously never tried because they were not technically feasible before Maverick: it&amp;rsquo;s time to explore and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-contract-triggered-buysell-walls&#34;&gt;Dynamic contract-triggered buy/sell walls
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the example from earlier about the stablecoin project posting liquidity as a buying wall to constrain the price? &lt;strong&gt;The project does not even needs its liquidity to do it&lt;/strong&gt;, as the same process can be replicated with a boosted pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project creates a boosted pool where all the liquidity is distributed on one tick below the price like above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project supplies incentives to the boosted pool for the duration of its choice &amp;amp; apes will do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can be automated and triggered entirely through smart contracts, meaning another contract could dynamically manage the incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-cvxcrvcrv&#34;&gt;The case of cvxCRV/CRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s study another checkmate case, the one of cvxCRV. Indeed, the cvxCRV/CRV Curve pool is the absolute worst offender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;a regular structure, absolutely sub-optimal for an asset trading in a constrained range like cvxCRV&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It harnesses a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; liquidity mining model where all LPs are paid equally&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to cvxCRV deposits, which make 75% of the pool, earning 75% of the rewards - while being close to useless liquidity-wise (as there are already too much cvxCRV in that pool).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-can-be-done-better&#34;&gt;So what can be done better?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the concentration could be finetuned much more at the liquidity structure level. cvxCRV is a &amp;ldquo;one-way asset&amp;rdquo;: you can wrap CRV to cvxCRV 1:1 through the Convex contracts, but converting cvxCRV to CRV is done on a DEX at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; This means cvxCRV has a price ceiling against CRV: in no world, cvxCRV could be worth &amp;gt;1 CRV, and the current price is around 0.95 CRV per cvxCRV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; The ideal structure for such a pool could be &lt;strong&gt;a concentration going from 1cvxCRV = 0.9 CRV to 1 cvxCRV = 0.99 CRV, offering vastly superior liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the incentivization layer, massive gains are to be made with a switch. Instead of paying all LPs equally while the pool is massively unbalanced, why not focus on those who bring the most value to the pool, aka the CRV component?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;d go with two joint pools to best cover that pair incentivize-wise: &lt;strong&gt;first, a static LP over ten bins&lt;/strong&gt; centered around the current price - it provides room for the price to express itself with sufficient liquidity &amp;amp; this structure is already &amp;gt;100x more efficient than the existing Curve V2 pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;==&amp;gt; For the nail in the coffin, we can &lt;strong&gt;add a one-tick left-right pool one top to maximize liquidity efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of this example help you understand that if you take this pool to Maverick, the compounded effect of the superior liquidity structure with a vastly more efficient incentivization model leads to results from a different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;curve-cvxcrv-crv.png&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently $54M TVL in Curve cvxCRV/CRV pool for a daily volume of around $300k daily (0.5% utilization). With a base incentive of 12% CRV, ~&lt;strong&gt;$6M of CRV tokens are expanded yearly to maintain this liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Maverick, a ~$500K  properly structured pool&lt;/strong&gt; ($250k static broad range + $250k left-right) &lt;strong&gt;would be sufficient to consistently process the $300k daily volume&lt;/strong&gt; with better prices than on Curve. Assuming the same incentivization intensity, &lt;strong&gt;it would cost $60k a year to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proto-liquidity-shaping-with-bunni&#34;&gt;Proto Liquidity Shaping with Bunni?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that, at this point, you get a better sense of why liquidity shaping is genuinely revolutionary, as it will allow another order-of-magnitude leap regarding the efficiency of both the liquidity structures and the incentivization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are earlier, less complete iterations on such a concept, provided by the liquidity manager built on top of UniswapV3 that allows incentivization on a customized range, for instance, rewards for LUSD/USDC LP, but only for the LUSD = 0.999 USDC to LUSD = 1.01 USDC range. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bunni.pro/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bunni&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of such services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those could be described as &amp;ldquo;proto liquidity shaping,&amp;rdquo; as they enable to force a specific price range but cannot apply different weights to each tick in that range: they are limited by the Uniswap V3 pool model that offers less flexibility than Maverick. In the end, both are quite complimentary as Bunni can be used to force a wide range, which can be further refined with a uneven static Maverick pool &amp;amp; finally maintained uber liquid at current price with a left-right on Maverick too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mav-token&#34;&gt;MAV TOKEN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clear perspectives on both the novel pool structure and incentivization model and their consequences, we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to add the last piece of a puzzle, one you&amp;rsquo;re likely more familiar with, but here too, there are key differences: the MAV token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released just a few weeks ago, the MAV token has been airdropped to early liquidity providers and protocol users. The initial airdrop is just &lt;strong&gt;the first of many&lt;/strong&gt;, and more are planned, for LPs, but also protocols harnessing Maverick or building on top of it. For more details on the intended distribution, check this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;As readers of this blog, I imagine you are extensively familiar with the veCRV model and its implications. If not, you&amp;rsquo;ve got some reading to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2021/crv-wars.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vemav--liquidity-directing-voting-vote-directed-liquidity-shaping&#34;&gt;veMAV &amp;amp; Liquidity Directing Voting (vote-directed liquidity shaping)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/liquidity-shaping-maverick/vemav.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;vemav&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the MAV token is sequential, currently in phase 1, where users can claim their drop, LP MAV, or lock it to obtain veMAV. &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 will introduce Maverick&amp;rsquo;s Liquidity Directing Voting and mark the true beginning of the MAV races.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is, of course, the expressivity enabled by Maverick that will also impact the tokenomics: unlike on veCRV or veBAL, where projects allocate liquidity to a whole pool, here, with Maverick, &lt;strong&gt;protocols will be able to target their voting power to a specific part of the AMM distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more information on veMAV here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/introducing-maverick-protocols-voting-escrow-model-c29a60120339&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introducing Maverick Protocol&amp;rsquo;s Voting-Escrow Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maverick--vemav-x-chain-strategy&#34;&gt;Maverick &amp;amp; veMAV X-chain strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical thing to note with the MAV token is that it implements &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/layerzero-omnichain-contracts/oft&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Layer Zero&amp;rsquo;s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard&lt;/a&gt;, greatly facilitating cross-chain operations. It enables MAV to exist natively on every chain and should ease the operational overhard for the team to launch the gauge system on a new network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem much at first glance, but it could make a massive difference. Indeed, Curve and Balancer have been slow to export their full gauge model to networks other than the mainnet they initially operate on. &lt;strong&gt;I expect Maverick to move much more quickly&lt;/strong&gt;, and the early empirical data validate it. In ~3 months of existence, Maverick has already launched two chains apart from mainnet: zkSync and BSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;another-main-difference-with-vecrv&#34;&gt;Another main difference with veCRV
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;veMAV implements several other changes compared to a base veCRV model, and I invite you to identify them all. Here are some other ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The veMAV per MAV weighting is not linear here, even if it still favors max lockers (4 years); the min lock of 1 week gives one veMAV/MAV, while max locking gives 5veMAV/MAV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no linear decay&lt;/strong&gt; like on veCRV - which is a significant UX improvement. It could also have very positive consequences for veMAV liquid wrappers, making it easier to keep close to the peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet there are still incentives to stay committed. Indeed, The veMAV/MAV ratio is computed with the formula &lt;code&gt;1.5^(lock end - contract launch)&lt;/code&gt;. With the lock end as the main parameter, veMAV lockers who want to maximize their power must extend their lock frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding wrappers, several existing projects have already expressed their intention of building on top of Maverick or veMAV, including Paladin, SpiralDAO, and StakeDAO. The MAV wars will be vicious, so read the fine print before locking your MAV somewhere else than in the veMAV contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forward-outlook--parting-words&#34;&gt;Forward outlook &amp;amp; parting words
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maverick is currently live on mainnet, zkSync, and BSC. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to remark on how much it dominates the volume on zkSync, even with a fraction of its competitor TVL:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mainnet, most of the success has been found with ETH-LSDs pairs (wstETH, swETH, etc.) and stablecoins. Maverick&amp;rsquo;s efficient liquidity structure is highly competitive with Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On volatile tokens, LPs are a bit shy still, just like it took a few months for people to get used to the novelty brought in by Uniswap V3. Interestingly, LPs are experimenting more on zkSync, especially on pairs such as ETH/USDC, thanks to the lowered gas costs, leading to an overall capital efficiency even more significant than on mainnet, here are the stats for today (July 06 2023):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniswap V3 - mainnet: 0.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - mainnet: 0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maverick - zkSync: 0.93&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started-with-maverick-as-a-user&#34;&gt;Getting started with Maverick as a user
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a learning curve for Maverick, as understanding how to structure liquidity properly can be intimidating because of all the options provided. Yet more options mean more expressivity and, thus, more efficiency and returns when adequately harnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make the most of Maverick as a user and discover the protocol in an environment with low fees, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend supplying your first LPs on zkSync&lt;/strong&gt; - as it will enable you to modify them at a low cost if needed. Like most new DeFi products, the best way to master it is to use it and see it behaves in various market conditions, so get at it: you might also be double-dipping on airdrops so that it can be quite a rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to check out the Boosted Pools, which - in addition to their incentives - have a pre-defined liquidity configuration, making them more accessible to LPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;liquidity-managers-its-time-to-wake-up&#34;&gt;Liquidity Managers, it&amp;rsquo;s time to wake up!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the project side, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute necessity for liquidity managers to understand and master Maverick&lt;/strong&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s by far the venue delivering the most liquidity efficiency. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help them in the process, since it has become a specialty of mine. Feel free to reach out if you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss how your project could harness liquidity shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Announcement: TokenBrice 🤝 Maverick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the next few months of the DEX wars will unfold; with Maverick already consistently in the top 5 of Ethereum DEXes by volume processed, I think it&amp;rsquo;s no stretch to envision it breaking into the top 3 by the end of year latest as the veMAV gauges will be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you better understand the paradigm shift that lies with the transition from liquidity mining / basic ve(3,3) to Maverick&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse implementing vote-directed liquidity shaping. Feel free to follow the events live, monitoring onchain data like as OGs do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post ve(3,3), the logical next step after veCRV?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solidly/Velodrome forks have been popping up like mushrooms, especially across the popular layer 2 like Arbitrum or zkSync. Solidly is now the top #3 forked protocol in DeFi and one of the rare cases where the forks (such as Velodrome) are the market leaders. At first glance, it could seem like just another fork hype train, like when we had the Uni/Sushi fork season, Olympus fork season, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, it’s overblown: an absurd amount of such DEXes are launching weekly, and 95% of them won’t be relevant six months from now. However, like with most of such hype trains, there is deep down, below the fluff, an actual fundamental innovation in how decentralized exchanges are designed that is worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article will dive deep into the Solidly and Velodrome models to understand why they became a standard fork template. With that said, we’ll be in an excellent position to ponder the next steps for these DEXes and what this market might look like in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get right to it!&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;⚔ CRV Wars: understanding the race to accumulate power to influence Curve Finance protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-ve33-dexes&#34;&gt;Introduction to ve(3,3) DEXes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into how Solidly built on top and tried to improve the veCRV model, let’s take a step back to consider the scope first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amm-structure-vs-incentivization-layer&#34;&gt;AMM Structure VS Incentivization Layer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to grasp the ve(3,3) DEXes story, we need to distinguish between two layers that are equally important for a decentralized exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The liquidity structure layer&lt;/strong&gt;: the various AMM models used to sustain liquidity, such as UNIv2’s x*y=k or Curve’s stableswap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;: fees + all other incentives directed to the liquidity provider, including token emissions (such as in the CRV model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the end of the day, 1 – the liquidity structure – is the heart of the game, the second layer – incentives – is crucial in attracting and sustaining sufficient liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curve innovated on both. While the models we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss today harnessed it, they &lt;strong&gt;focus entirely on improving the incentivization layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed at the current stage, most of ve(3,3) DEXes harnessing the Solidly or Velodrome model only offer two well-known liquidity structure types: x*y=k &amp;amp; stableswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;notice info&#34; &gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first notice-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;icon-notice baseline&#34;&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href=&#34;#info-notice&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the DEXes, those two liquidity models are called correlated/volatile or stable/volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about what was so interesting about Andre’s Cronje original Solidly and what insights we can draw from its failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;andre-cronjes-solidly-innovations&#34;&gt;Andre Cronje’s Solidly Innovations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in early 2022 on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cronje’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, the crucial part of Solidly’s vision was a significant improvement in the utility for lockers. On Curve, lockers are committed for four years with non-transferable vote-escrowed tokens. While it’s great for the long-term incentives alignment of all the participants of the Curve ecosystem, it also creates a sizable barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus came ve(3,3), with at its core &lt;strong&gt;the veNFT&lt;/strong&gt;. While veCRV are illiquid, veSOLID positions are represented by the veNFT, enabling their transfer or OTC sale/purchase. It helps make locking less scary. To further incentivize it, Cronje introduced “&lt;strong&gt;anti-dilutive rebases&lt;/strong&gt;”, a concept drawn from Ampleforth/Olympus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is simple: since the Curve/Solidly DEX model emits tokens weekly to liquidity providers, vetokens holders are constantly diluted. They must keep increasing their position even to maintain their current vote share. To compensate for this, veSOLID holders receive a weekly rebase proportional to the weekly emissions under the Solidly model. This allows them to maintain their voting share even if no new tokens are locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these changes, Solidly inherited most of the Curve model, including &lt;strong&gt;the LP boost&lt;/strong&gt; feature, enabling vetokens holders to earn boosted yields on their liquidity position. This feature has real consequences since it pretty much “calls for a Convex.” Indeed, the logical conclusion of such a feature is one/a few actors seizing significant amounts of vetokens and providing their LP boost to depositors for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence/absence of this feature is the critical difference between the Solidly and Velodrome models, so we’ll touch back on it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there one last critical twist to the voter incentives model. On Curve, LP get half of the trading fees collected + CRV emissions, while voters have no exposure to the fees of the pool they are voting on. It can lead to situation where voters are voting for pools just for the bribes, even if the pool provides no volume to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Solidly, the LPs are only rewarded with SOLID emission, and the LP fees are redirected to the voters of the pool. Thus, as a veSOLID holder, to optimize your earnings, you are incentivized to consider the volume on the pool you are voting on, and not just the bribes. This leads to a better alignment of the incentives of the main participants of the protocol (swapper, liquidity provider, veHolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly also innovated on the launch strategy, with &lt;strong&gt;an airdrop targeted at protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on their onchain activity on Fantom, where Solidly was. Together, all those innovations and the hype led to a massive amount of liquidity quickly attracted to the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Solidly’s initial implementation had a few key weaknesses, including an aggressively steep decline in emissions and fully permissionless gauge creation that allowed any pools to receive SOLID rewards. It was gamable, so it was gamed. Soon, tokens were created for the sole purpose of farming SOLID, and the price quickly spiraled, along with the TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/solidly-tvl.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;cover-image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TVL disappeared as quickly as it came, and Solidly became a part of history for most. But those who followed the events closely knew that Solidly’s failure did not come from a weakness in the ve(3,3) model but more of &lt;strong&gt;an overlooked detail of its implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that while Solidly was no more, ve(3,3) would likely resurface. And it did, a few months later, on another chain made by another team: enter Velodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;velodromes-refinements-to-the-solidly-model&#34;&gt;Velodrome’s refinements to the Solidly model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiscan.info/protocols/velodrome-v2/optimism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Velodrome&lt;/a&gt; harnessed the Solidly model and fixed the issue with emissions by implementing a &lt;strong&gt;whitelist for gauges&lt;/strong&gt;, helping to avoid the situation where rewards are allocated to made-up tokens, as seen on Solidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodrome went far beyond a mere fork, though, and implemented further improvements; among them were a more sustainable emissions model and &lt;strong&gt;removing the LP boost feature&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning there is no preferential treatment for veVELO holders in terms of yield. Velodrome also streamlines the experience for first-time LPs who might be confused with the yield range you see on DEXes with LP boost implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical features, a large part of Velodrome’s success is due to the &lt;strong&gt;team’s execution and care for the business development strategies&lt;/strong&gt;, an essential part of the ve(3,3) model. Built on Optimism, Velodrome found its PMF as the chain liquidity layer. Thanks to its model, sustaining liquidity on Velodrome is much more cost-effective for projects than, say, on Uniswap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Solidly, &lt;strong&gt;Velodrome airdropped several protocols with a veVELO NFT,&lt;/strong&gt; no strings attached, which helped immensely to attract the initial voting and bribing activity. The protocol found a good fit, mostly with other protocols emitting stablecoins or ETH liquid stake derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/defiwars-velodrome.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost a year, and the activity has sustained, thanks to careful and progressive adjustments of the &lt;strong&gt;OP incentives allocated on the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/tour-de-op-updates-631268181baa&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tour de OP&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are used to incentivize two behaviors essential to sustain the flywheel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bribes from protocols, incentivized by OP bribes matching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking of veVELO, incentivized by an OP lock bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bribe matching is further increased for projects which lock veVELO or deploy sizeable amounts of protocol-owned liquidity to the exchange, helping further amplify the reinforcing effect: those who want to build liquidity sustained over the long term on Velodrome have been given solid reasons to buy VELO, lock and vote, bribe, and supply POL, &lt;strong&gt;ideally all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to Velodrome topping the protocols TVL charts on Optimism and processing about 30% of the total volume of the chain vs 50% for Uniswap, which has roughly ¼ of Velodrome’s TVL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2023/solidly-velodrome-template/optimism-volume.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;optimism-DEX-volume&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why such a spread between the both? Simple: Uniswap&amp;rsquo;s Volume/TVL ratio is ~9x above Velodrome right now because the liquidity on Uniswap is much more concentrated and thus more efficient. But it’s about to change as Velodrome V2 is arriving soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-velodrome-v2&#34;&gt;Introducing Velodrome V2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Uniswap had a headstart with concentrated liquidity, it will change rapidly. The v3 license &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/governance/liscense-modifications&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;expired on April 1st 2023&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the model is now much easier to re-implement. Many DEXes, including Solidly/Velodrome forks, intend to harness this. Still, to keep this article focused, we’ll only cover what is announced for Velodrome V2, expected in the next few weeks/months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Velodrome V2 will not just mark &lt;strong&gt;the introduction of UNI-v3 style of LP on the DEX&lt;/strong&gt; but also significant UX/UI improvements, a relayer to ease the management of veNFT, artwork for the veNFT, and much more. Check the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-road-ah-43488531bb0e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;V2 announcement article&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you understand the benefits of the Solidly and Velodrome models. While I mention the myriad of forks in the introduction, I’ve stayed on course with this article. I guess this calls for a follow-up where I comb through their main forks and the modifications they implement into the template: stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Business Development&lt;/strong&gt; | ve(3,3), just like Curve, are protocols for protocols. The team&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and ability to efficiently prioritize and executive on BD is a sizable success factor of the DEX over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the launch/airdrop/top racers rooster&lt;/strong&gt; | Even if BD is done well, a given ve(3,3) DEX is only as good as its top racers. Yes, you want them bribing, voting, and driving awareness, but not only. The quality of the liquidity driven to the DEX also matters (volume/TVL ratio).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LP Boost and its consequences&lt;/strong&gt; | If a ve(3,3) implements LP boost, it calls for Convex-like protocols. The success of the ve(3,3) will be impacted by how much and how well its Convex-likes do. To follow the key stats on the various wrappers and main veTokens holders, check - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ve(3,3) + Liquidity Concentration&lt;/strong&gt; | While ve(3,3) is a significant innovation for the incentives layer of the DEX, it currently harnesses sub-par liquidity structures. Properly matching the ve(3,3) incentives model with an efficient UNIv3-style liquidity structure will help further improve the effectiveness of the flywheel.&lt;/li&gt;
