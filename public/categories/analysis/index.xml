        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2021/technofeudalism-sovereign-individual/francis-bacon.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Sovereign Individual in the age of technofeudalism" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember when we used to talk of a &amp;ldquo;post-covid world&amp;rdquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s funny to see how the expression quickly stopped being used as people realized the social order of the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; world would be as nonsensical and wasteful as the previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the phrase had the merit to stress the role of the pandemic which brought so much stress on our social structures that it resulted in twenty years of &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; packed into one. I think that today already if we&amp;rsquo;re attentive and careful, we can envision the next steps of our societal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-post-covid-worlds&#34;&gt;The two post-covid worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I for one welcomed the &amp;ldquo;post-Covid&amp;rdquo; world with open arms, as it finally made apparent fundamental shifts that previously were hard to notice. It can be scary and worrisome, but it has one merit: the current situation is exerting &lt;strong&gt;too much pressure on the status quo for it to sustain itself&lt;/strong&gt; — it will eventually normalize one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious end is the extrapolation of the current one: states becoming &lt;strong&gt;increasingly greedy in terms of surveillance and control&lt;/strong&gt;, despite a lack of provable results coming from these strategies. As the situation worsens, they tend to tighten their grip even more to maintain a fleeting appearance of order. The reality is that the facts do not matter anymore — only the perception of them is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis has been documented since the middle of the past century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What&amp;rsquo;s left are citizens who have essentially less liberty than serfs from the Middle Ages, since they are &lt;strong&gt;oppressed by a remote and inaccessible technostructure&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a lord you can visit and plead to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end is the &lt;strong&gt;sovereign individual&lt;/strong&gt;, as described by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg more than twenty years ago.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Such individuals understood the decreasing power and importance of states and developed a form of statelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;treat nation-states like mere service providers&lt;/strong&gt; (health care, education, justice, etc.) and put them in competition with one another. While they are still citizens of one or several countries, they are not tied to them and can move at the moment&amp;rsquo;s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality will allow for a weird but unavoidable cohabitation of the two trends. That&amp;rsquo;s the gist of the thesis I want to explore today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This issue is not political.&lt;/strong&gt; Blue, red, who cares? We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a topic of higher significance than who gets to star the political muppet show of your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nation-states-sliding-into-irrelevance&#34;&gt;Nation-States sliding into irrelevance
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thesis is built upon a previous one: the progressive erosion of power and influence of nation states. It won&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight, it&amp;rsquo;s more of an iterative proccess, just like how our previous power structures fadded into irrelevance, such as the Church: they are still around, but their influence is order of magnitude lower than it used to be a couple of centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several concomitant phenomena are leading nation-states to obsolescence&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First the most obvious: &lt;strong&gt;states are running dry&lt;/strong&gt;! Indeed, the power of states is directly indexed on their wealth. Yet most states are increasingly unable to properly collect the taxes they are due — which are their main source of sustenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States are &lt;strong&gt;unable to have coherent analysis, draw long-term plans, and follow through on them&lt;/strong&gt;, and I think the occurrence of Covid dissipated the few doubts left amongst the skeptics. The reasons here are various including short mandates, our political life turning into a low-tier reality TV, or the place lobbying took.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;States&amp;rsquo; justice is a mockery&lt;/strong&gt;, as some wealthy citizens are outside its reach while those with less status suffer its abuses (police brutality, systemic racism, etc.). Think about whistleblowers if you have any doubt on this: &lt;strong&gt;modern states preserve themselves at the expense of anything else&lt;/strong&gt;, including the life and basic human rights of their citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;no accountability nor check and balances&lt;/strong&gt; for our modern states: the growth loop of the structure is now broken — which is why I am convinced of their upcoming demise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally and most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;states were unable to understand, compute and adapt to the digital reality&lt;/strong&gt; — it requires a form of horizontal thinking that cannot cohabit with their top-down power distribution. We saw the dire consequences of this with the development of the Internet, and we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing it once again with decentralized ledger technologies (~blockchains).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technofeudalism-fills-the-void&#34;&gt;Technofeudalism fills the void
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citizens no longer have root access to the system that rules them&lt;/strong&gt;, their administrative privilege has been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The void left by the states is filled by a more chaotic and insidious structure sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;technofeudalism&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. One of the merits of the states was their relative transparency: you have a government made of public people, supposedly in charge and responsible. The head is identified and (supposedly) held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What grew in its absence is on the other hand a &lt;strong&gt;headless structure&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s made of a myriad of corporations, sometimes promoting shared interests — such as reduced taxation or more lax working laws — but also frequently at odds with one another about specific topics. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a disparate group unable to align on anything but an ever more methodical exploitation of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;our governments got &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo;: they have been captured by private interests.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to lobbying, the citizen&amp;rsquo;s administrative privileges have been removed — they no longer have root access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;will of the people&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;public opinion&amp;rdquo; does not matter anymore as it became &lt;strong&gt;a mere metric to monitor&lt;/strong&gt; with no real weight in the game. It&amp;rsquo;s kept at a certain threshold to preserver the illusion of democracy. Sometimes, the threshold is reached and protests arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s critical is what happens after: when citizens finally dare to ask for anything of significance, in the best cases, they get swamped by conventional thinking or in the worst case face brutal police repression, just like lords would send their footmen to silence a riot without a care about the demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-citizen-and-the-serf&#34;&gt;The citizen and the serf
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find comparisons that can shed light on the status of today&amp;rsquo;s average citizen, one has to go far back in time to the serfs of the Middle Ages. Indeed we find several shared features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute &lt;strong&gt;lack of autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;, as both depend on a third party (state or corporation) for basic sustenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannot determine oneself&lt;/strong&gt;: while it&amp;rsquo;s obvious for serfs, it&amp;rsquo;s as powerful but much more insidious for modern-day citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low to no influence over the power structures&lt;/strong&gt;: a serf can plead to his lord — on the other hand, think about what does a citizen need to do nowadays to simply be heard (and ignored)? The grinding despair of our contemporary world led some of our peers to immolate themselves to shine a light on their cause — think about the level of anguish one must reach to walk this path&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the modern iteration of feudalism has a potent brand new leg that made it possible: the &amp;ldquo;technostructure&amp;rdquo;. Modern-day serfs are living in an increasingly digital world. As soon as they venture into this realm they are in private property — &lt;strong&gt;they renounce ownership over their data and sovereignty over their assets&lt;/strong&gt; (your Facebook pictures do not belong to you). Very few citizens are aware of this, even less are technical-savvy enough to resist it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize my perspective, here are the main fundamental changes that are taking place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The states are less and less meaningful and influential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are increasingly replaced by private entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This replacement actualizes a &lt;strong&gt;de-facto enslavement of the majority of the population&lt;/strong&gt;, unable to self-determine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minority — the sovereign individuals — can extract themselves from the influence of their states, thanks to their wealth, technological savviness or other expertises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-become-more-sovereign&#34;&gt;How to become more sovereign?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to withdraw oneself from the influence of states and private corporations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the real battle is now being waged around the question of who will become sovereign. At the time the book was written, sovereignty was mainly acquired by playing with the world of the past. The situation has changed now: there are now more paths to &amp;ldquo;self-sovereignty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) has completely changed the situation: it is a parallel financial universe built on a radically different set of &lt;strong&gt;pragmatic values&lt;/strong&gt;: transparency, resistance to censorship, composability and open-source. Thus, decentralized finance is in a way &lt;strong&gt;the first &amp;ldquo;digital realm&amp;rdquo; accessible without giving up ownership of its goods or data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the values of our political system are promises that must be actively kept, DeFi&amp;rsquo;s values are applied at the code level: they are &lt;strong&gt;the result of the normal functioning of the system and cannot be violated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFi thus allows individuals to possess and exchange goods without the need for an intermediary - it was a form of missing piece to the safeguarding of sovereignty. Thanks to DeFi, everyone can access elite financial services that are more resilient than those of the conventional world, made possible by a mix of private companies and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy Debord cornered and analyses the concept — he called it the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote more extensively about this thesis about two years ago: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/naas.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Demise of Nation States: Introducing the Nation as a Service (NaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tokenbrice.xyz/content/posts/2018/demise-ns.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Why is technocentrism killing blockchains?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/why-is-technocentrism-killing-blockchains/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 11:39:41 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/why-is-technocentrism-killing-blockchains/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/technocentrism/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Why is technocentrism killing blockchains?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its very early days, the blockchain industry was a world for geeks. It really made sense at first: I think it was a conjunction of two main factors. First, technical profiles were already deeply involved in promoting the values (autonomy, privacy, trustless cooperation) that blockchains can deliver. Moreover, at the humble beginnings, the roadblocks were technical ones involving “hard science” fields: mathematics, cryptography, game theory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the blockchains developed (Bitcoin is 10 years old!), the people involved did not get any more diverse. &lt;strong&gt;Right now everybody is so focused on the tech that the whole industry has a tunnel vision.&lt;/strong&gt; Go to meet-up and see it for yourself: it’s only tech talk. Every time you go to one, you’re left scratching your head wondering if we even need such a complex solution to a problem you’re not even sure exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;that just like any major government institutions, “the blockchain industry” (if that’s even a thing) is already suffering from groupthink and lack of diversity.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;15-35 years old, tech-focused, guy&lt;/code&gt; description matches 95% of the profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a high-level design perspective, we know it&amp;rsquo;s simply inefficient at best, if not profoundly detrimental: think about the decisions our &lt;code&gt;45-75 years old, male with elite education, rich, white&lt;/code&gt; politicians come up with. Diversity is not just a shiny cool thing to add to show you&amp;rsquo;re progressive: it&amp;rsquo;s actually the &lt;strong&gt;biggest success driver of success for any given group, even before education or expertise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re direly missing outsiders, people who will look at the systems being designed and ask the “naive” yet hard and insightful questions. I intend to demonstrate that to you with two very simple examples — I’ll explain the concepts I’m referring so you won’t need to be a tech lad or a blockchain-expert to follow my though process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proof-of-stakethe-humans-are-rational-beings-assumption&#34;&gt;Proof of Stake — the “humans are rational beings” assumption
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ️ Blockchains need mechanisms for their different participants to reach a consensus. The most famous one is called Proof of Work and involve mining: people dedicating computational power to solve a mathematical challenge in order to verify transactions, and being rewarded for doing so. Proof of Stake (PoS) is another take to solve this problem: instead of the computing power, this time people lock “stakes” (coins of the given currency) in order to validate a transaction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;strong&gt;we’re making with Proof of Stake the very same mistake economics — as an academic field — has been making from day one: assuming that we are all rational beings who behave logically, always trying to maximize our own best interest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, in the case of proof of stake, the whole system holds onto the premise that people don’t want to lose money: so if they start to misbehave (trying to game the system), they will have their “stake” slashed, potentially all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room that is rarely accounted for, as you probably understand already, is that &lt;strong&gt;people are sometimes willing to lose money because they act on other motives&lt;/strong&gt;: love, hate, rage… I can picture dozens of scenarios where a group of people would be willing to burn millions if not billions of dollars just to destroy a chain, but one will be enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s say a PoS protocol becomes increasingly popular, to the point where major banks are worried. Three of them realize that by banding together, and with a little disinformation/scare campaign, they can crash the price 30–40%, and then expand barely a fraction of their annual income to progressively take control of the chain. The coins they buy to destroy the chain are accounted as a cost. They’re not motivated by profit: they are motivated by fear, which is potentially the strongest human driver.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ️ There are ways to protect a chain against such an attack and projects accounting for this, my point is more about the issue of making the assumption that humans are rational while designing this consensus mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;layer-2getting-lost-in-the-tech-losing-sight-of-realusage&#34;&gt;Layer 2 — Getting lost in the tech, losing sight of real usage
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve heard about what we call layer-2 solutions? They are essentially networks built on top of the base network (Bitcoin or Ethereum) to allow faster and fee-less transactions. The most prominent developments include Lightning network, Plasma, Casper and or other state chains. We’ll focus on Bitcoin’s Lightning network as its mains flaws are shared by most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is simple: &lt;strong&gt;some layer 2 solutions somehow managed to provide a worse user experience than the base layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are the restrictions of the Lightning Network, that will never be lifted because they are due to protocol-level decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A channel must be open to receive/send money (aka you must be “online” to send/receive).&lt;br&gt;
 — You don’t have to, on the base layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A channel must be provided with some currency to be opened. &lt;strong&gt;It cannot allow the transit of more currency than what’s in it&lt;/strong&gt;. Say you open a channel with 1 BTC, someone sends you 10 BTC — doesn’t matter, you won’t be able to get more than 1 BTC out of it. &lt;br&gt;
— The base layer knows no limitations to the amounts you can send (as long as you can face the transaction cost) and receive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the transactions are settled off-chain (except the state update — the settlement when you close a channel), which means they are low-fee and fast, but you also lose the security and accountability provided by on-chain settlements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from a very high level perspective, &lt;strong&gt;the layer 2 tradoff is as follows: you loose most (if not all) benefits provided by blockchains + you have to face additional significant limitations but your transactions are faster and cost less.&lt;/strong&gt; Why such a need for speed? An Ethereum transaction currently takes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;~20 second&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where it gets funny: this whole thing has been in development for more than 3 years. So far, there are no real usages or use cases provided by layer-2 solutions that you can’t do better with the appropriate base layer solution. There will never be. Yet we have hundreds of technical papers discussing its potential implementation and crowds getting hyped at the idea of the Lightning Network making small, incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go a meetup talking layer-2 you’ll meet a crowd of semi-enthusiastic nerds discussing the highly technical details of the different implementations. You can ask them my very question: how do you expect this thing to ever be used if the UX is worse than layer 1? They’ll answer you 100% on the technical side, and miss the whole point completely — &lt;strong&gt;breaking through the tunnel vision requires diversity, from within and at an early stage of the development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-leave-blockchains-to-thegeeks&#34;&gt;Don’t leave blockchains to the geeks!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are more than just cool technology. &lt;strong&gt;They are protocols to implement societal-wide change.&lt;/strong&gt; Mass adoption will disrupt the organization of the whole world, so we need people from all backgrounds and perspectives to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;psychologists&lt;/strong&gt; to understand, at the individual level, the current worries people have with blockchains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;sociologists&lt;/strong&gt; to help us figure out how, at the macro-level, we can answer and articulate these concerns to initiate of change of habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;literary profiles&lt;/strong&gt; to help us craft a narrative of change and tell an inclusive and compelling story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;magicians&lt;/strong&gt; to figure out how we can captivate audiences with that story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;artists&lt;/strong&gt; to give a body to the story of the Etherial world — one people can identify and resonate with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;philosophers&lt;/strong&gt; to consider the fundamental consequences of these changes and anticipate their impacts on how we see the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;waiters, taxi drivers, and stewards&lt;/strong&gt; to keep a direct channel with every layer of our society, reminding us of its beautiful diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;social workers&lt;/strong&gt; to help us design systems adapted to the realities of everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need &lt;strong&gt;teachers&lt;/strong&gt; to sensitize students as to why privacy, autonomy and decentralization are necessary to be self-sovereign and truly exercise our free will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hell, we even need &lt;strong&gt;public servants&lt;/strong&gt; to understand how to jump from the protocol to the actual real-life implementation, with all its frustrations and the nitty-gritty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the world of tomorrow, let’s make sure it lives by its standards: &lt;strong&gt;the people of tomorrow are diverse and inclusive, so why can’t we be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to give involved in blockchains while not having a technical background? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TokenBrice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll do everything I can to help you find your spot because you are a NECESSARY addition. Don’t leave the design of the base protocols of tomorrow to the nerds — they’ll do an awful job at it solely by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;⚠️ My opinions are solely my own — I’m expressing myself outside any professional quality or relationship. And yes, I mostly fit the blockchain mono-profile of a 15–35yo privileged white dude, except for my education not being science-focused, which is yet another proof of my whole point: we need diversity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deep Work: the ultimate state of focus?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/deep-work-the-ultimate-state-of-focus/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/deep-work-the-ultimate-state-of-focus/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Deep Work: the ultimate state of focus?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;, a book published by Cal Newport in 2016 was highly impactful. While Cal’s writing did not bring anything new to the table, it put the spotlight on an idea that was rarely mentioned outside the psychology circles: the “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;” (also known as “being in the zone”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Deep Work Hypothesis:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare, and at the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. … the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2NXMePw&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;p.14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers took a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/focus-and-deep-work-your-secret-weapons-to-becoming-a-10x-developer-8e203a6ad291&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;keen interest for the concept&lt;/a&gt;, yet what Cal Newport suggests &lt;strong&gt;could apply to any profession&lt;/strong&gt;. He explores the idea of “committing to depth”: if you manage to achieve a state of deep concentration while you work, you can achieve phenomenal results &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; take away pride, accomplishment, and satisfaction from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why his ideas gained attention not only from productivity-buffs but also for people who lost touch with the meaning of their jobs and were looking to reclaim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His book touches on other themes related to deep work and its impacts. He addresses the vanity of social media, and the benefits of boredom as well. He also talks about how to **focus **— not a work-related focus but what you decide to focus on as a person — &lt;strong&gt;defines your life and what you make of it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Deep Work — Cal Newport&#34;
	
	
&gt;

    &gt;Deep Work — Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, his book is full of interesting insights. If you find value in this article which overlays its key finding and how to put them into practice, I invite you &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to read the full book.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deliberate-practice&#34;&gt;Deliberate practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach a state of deep focus and concentration, he advocates for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29#Deliberate_practice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;, a concept pioneered by psychologist K.Anders Ericsson. One of his key findings is that the expert’s performance in a given skill has less to do with innate talent and is more likely &lt;strong&gt;tied to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;how the expert deliberately practices being good at it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice%28PsychologicalReview%29.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably heard about Gladwell 10, 000-Hour rule? He considers it to be the key to success in any field. The theory is appealing considering it gives a clear path to expertise: dedicate the time for it! The rule quickly gained traction in popular culture, &lt;strong&gt;despite&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/expert-rule-10000-hours-not-true-2017-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;being debunked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as Ericsson’s research proved, repetition by itself is not enough to become good at a given skill. He lays out the two pillars of deliberate practice, which helps to develop expertise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on a defined perimeter&lt;/strong&gt;: the path to expertise starts by breaking down the skills required to become one. From here, the wannabe-expert can focus on improving those skillsets during his training or day-to-day activities. It works even better when it’s paired with immediate feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous and challenging practice&lt;/strong&gt;: the practice must be frequent (ideally daily) and always challenging. The practice is “deliberate”: the expert practices with the intention of mastering the given skill. This one ties back to grit and perseverance. Focusing on the challenges we struggle with helps us learn faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impacts-on-motivation-andoutcomes&#34;&gt;Impacts on motivation and outcomes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep work, and deliberate practice impact more than merely our state of concentration, the outcome of our work, and the pace at which we achieve it. &lt;strong&gt;Deep states of focus bring more satisfaction from what we do,&lt;/strong&gt; and a sense of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increased satisfaction we pull from our work helps us to stay motivated, making it easy to keep dedicating hours to the practice… Essentially, when deliberate practice is adequately set in motion, it creates &lt;strong&gt;a virtuous circle&lt;/strong&gt; of practice, learning, satisfaction, and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deep-work-inpractice&#34;&gt;Deep work in practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the basics on the theory. You can read Cal Newport’ book, or Ericsson’s paper to research it further. Now let’s see how to implement it in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-yourself-for-deepwork&#34;&gt;Setting yourself for deep work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your job and habits, this part can be the easiest as well as the hardest. Basically, to be able to achieve a deep state of concentration you need to set yourself up for success. In practical terms, it means creating a distraction-free work environment. I can&amp;rsquo;t give you the magic formula of focus, but I can share my personal practices; what follows is my focus setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set my phone in airplane mode, out of sight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I close my communication apps (such as Slack, or Thunderbird)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All apps unrelated to my current task are closed. I usually only have my editor (Typora), and Firefox opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I categorically refuse all notifications in my browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have 4–10 tabs maximum opened, all related to my current task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I work in a shared environment, I put my headphones on. It helps me to get in my zone and reduces the physical interruptions from coworkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I put on repetitive electronic music, with little to no lyrics, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lihaERrt2v0&amp;amp;list=PLKgkTIfBISr3qf4hvzmdbwIRd8giXtX0i&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your setup will probably be different, but you can see a pattern here: reducing interruptions and cutting yourself out from the world to enter your bubble of focus and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-it-work-foryou&#34;&gt;Making it work for you
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re all set, it’s time to work and stay focused. You can use different techniques, but there is one particularly useful to get used to working in a highly focused environment: the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to understand, and supported by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zapier.com/blog/best-pomodoro-apps/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many apps&lt;/a&gt; available on all kinds of environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/pomodoro.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide on the task you will tackle. It must be unambiguous and well defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work for 25 minutes (a pomodoro), undistracted, on this one thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a short 5-minute break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 1–3, up to 4 times and then take a longer break (20 min).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to be able to break up your task in 25 min batches. Some tasks will require several pomodoros, and that’s OK as long as you’re able to break them into smaller consistent tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-goals-into-small-achievable-tasks&#34;&gt;Breaking goals into small, achievable tasks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complex task, such as &lt;code&gt;make a landing page for my project&lt;/code&gt; is not an executable goal. I need to break it down into smaller steps to realize it using the pomodoro technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and analyze landing pages of similar projects, and summarize my main findings. (1–3 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft the content for my landing page (3–4 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft the layout of my landing page (1–2 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a relevant theme/template to use (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the hosting and the theme (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the content on my new landing page (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the template (1 pomodoro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polishing and review (1–3 pomodoros)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking your tasks into smaller chunks help you on so many levels. &lt;strong&gt;First, it streamlines the execution. Then it helps to avoid procrastinating.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, it makes it much easier to determine how long with the implementation of the given task takes. I cannot estimate &lt;code&gt;make a landing page,&lt;/code&gt; but once broke down into eight smaller steps I know I&amp;rsquo;ll take me between 10 and 16 pomodoros (~6.5h maximum, excluding breaks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-and-be-willing-tolearn&#34;&gt;Learning, and be willing to learn
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve figured it what your deep work environment looks like, and you’ve got the gist of the pomodoro or other productivity techniques, you’ll be able to work much more efficiently. It also works very well for studying and learning new skills. You can also dedicate some time to read on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;how to learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, it comes down to curiosity. Remember the “challenging practice” I mentioned earlier? Attacking new problems and stepping out of what you already know is the best way to grow. You will also need to be, or become a self-learner. It means being able to fix your issues by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that hard if you know how to search answers for any given problems. It takes minutes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bynd.com/news-ideas/google-advanced-search-comprehensive-list-google-search-operators&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to learn about and master Google search operators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/deep-work/search-operators.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It benefits all kind of profiles, as you will become much more efficient in your online searches. It helps you to avoid asking for help when it’s not necessary. Save your requests for situations where you’ve covered the widely accessible basics and are still without answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-the-depths-ofwork&#34;&gt;Exploring the depths of work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path to focus is hard. You’ll probably need a few weeks to be able to properly chain a few pomodoros together and start to make the focus time longer, up to 50–60 minutes. You’ll see and feel the benefits of these techniques pretty quickly. It will get more comfortable and easier to achieve a state of flow, and you’ll have breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck on your path to productivity and most importantly: don&amp;rsquo;t forget to enjoy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The attention economy: from engagement to dollars</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-attention-economy-from-engagement-to-dollars/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 15:00:20 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-attention-economy-from-engagement-to-dollars/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/attention-economy/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The attention economy: from engagement to dollars" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention economy is the idea that we’re switching to or already exploring a new economic paradigm where the individuals’ attention is the limiting factor. Goods and content became more accessible and cheaper to produce, but they are now facing a demand wall: attention is a scarce resource — a person has only so much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our mental capabilities are limited and therefore so is the receptiveness of information.&lt;/strong&gt; With the multiplication and the diversification of content (books, videos, blog posts, social media, etc.), we observe a paradigm shift. &lt;strong&gt;The limiting factor switched&lt;/strong&gt;: we’re running out of captivated eyeballs for all the content that gets produced daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/attention-economy/60s.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention became the new scarce limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is very dense, as it recoups pretty much the whole digital marketing industry. We will start with some considerations on attention itself before exploring the impact of the attention economy on the format and content of the media we consume. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the other side of the mirror and see how marketing professionals are addressing this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attention-the-unit-of-the-neweconomy&#34;&gt;Attention, the unit of the new economy?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention is a complex phenomenon. We all have a basic understanding of it when we crave for it or get it. However, we often fail to realize how the attention dynamics drive us in our behavior online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mechanics-of-attention&#34;&gt;The mechanics of attention
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention is &lt;strong&gt;a resource that can lead us to action&lt;/strong&gt;. Once we have it, we can also pass it to someone else, and put her/him under the spotlight. To understand how attention works in our modern world, considering its relationship with money is vital. We tend to think that money can buy attention yet we fail to recognize that this feat cannot be achieved consistently. &lt;strong&gt;Money cannot reliably buy attention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money came with a paradigm of value: with its price units, it made it easy to put a price on everything. &lt;strong&gt;Attention is a wholly different beast. It does not come in precise, indistinguishable units&lt;/strong&gt;. The listeners’ identity matter, and so do their level of attention since there’s no absolute. Therefore, within the attention economy, exchanges are more complex than their streamlined monetary counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just like wealth, attention can build up. Every time you draw attention to you, you somehow build or deplete a stock. If you provide something of interest to your audience, it will grow with each session. With that in mind, we can consider attention like &lt;strong&gt;a kind of enduring wealth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-roots-of-the-attention-economy&#34;&gt;The roots of the Attention Economy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public has just recently started to be aware of the attention economy, it’s been theorized a while ago already. To dive deeper into the nature of attention, I recommend to read the transcript of this fascinating conference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Attention Economy and the Net (1997)&lt;/a&gt;. While Michael H. Goldhaber did not coined the term “attention economy,” his conference helps to understand better where it’s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He draws a metaphor of the switch from the monetary economy to the attention economy using the last major transition as a referral point: the end of the feudal period and the transition to the capitalist economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of the feudal period, the pomp and display of the nobility reached a level never before attained; the most gorgeous armor, the most magnificent tournaments of knights, the most elaborate ceremonies between rival nobles, the most brilliant marriages, the greatest interest in noble lineage. But by then it had lost all real function or importance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So today, when the stock market goes up and up, when money wealth itself seems a source of fame more than ever, when being number one on Forbes 400 list seems the height of perfection, when every basketball superstar wants a contract that is at least a million more than the last record one, we seem to be more dazzled by money than ever, just as we seem to be more intrigued by material goods than ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But these interests are superficial and faddish. They are signs of decadence not of a glorious future for the money economy. Even in themselves they speak to the growing desire for attention, the need for it as well. Money is now little more numbers, one number among many, and as a source of lasting attention it can fade in an instant. The attention economy is already here, and more completely so every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-face-of-the-attention-economy-a-brief-history-of-onlinemedia&#34;&gt;The face of the attention economy: a brief history of online media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention economy manifests itself everywhere on the internet nowadays. However, some trends or activity make its realities more palpable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk consider content farms for a minute. Content farms are low-efforts website made to maximize the audience using a different kind of strategies. Filled with ads, their goal is to develop their audience as much as possible to increase their advertising income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the strategy was simple: Google was still somehow easy to game. Publications such as Demand Media amassed a large audience with low-value pieces of content optimized for a specific topic. Back then, the actual time spent on the site after a search was not a profoundly impacting factor of a given website ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Two famous updates to Google&amp;rsquo;s ranking algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2011, Google released an update to its ranking algorithm that impacted content farms: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-panda&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt;. Its goal was to reduce the prominence of content farms in the search results. It penalized websites based on different triggers such as thin, low quality and duplicate content, or the overall space occupied by ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-content-farms-to-clickbaits&#34;&gt;From content farms to clickbaits
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content farms were deeply impacted, as their traffic plummeted. Soon, the activity became unprofitable. However, in the wake of content farms disappearance, the development of social media offered new opportunities for content tricksters. &lt;strong&gt;Content farms imploded, and clickbait and linkbait content quickly took their spot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of gaming Google, these new media were able to &lt;strong&gt;lure millions of people to junk content using social media&lt;/strong&gt;, and particularly Facebook. They used catchy cover images and mastered the art of producing nonsensical yet attractive headlines. The headlines play on emotions to induce a click:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A school girl gave her lunch to a homeless man. What he did next will leave you in tears!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15 hilarious tweets of stupid people that makes you think ‘Do these people even exist?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supermodels apply these three simple tricks to look young. Click to know what they are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashuta Bhattarai provides a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/zerone-magazine/you-wont-believe-how-these-9-shocking-clickbaits-work-number-8-is-a-killer-4cb2ceded8b6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;well-written and highly ironic overview&lt;/a&gt; of the main techniques used to drive clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Listicles&lt;/a&gt; (article listing tops) became a recurrent pattern of low-effort yet high-impact articles. While the exhaustive formula of virality is not solved yet, we have a good idea of the different elements that make it. &lt;strong&gt;Emotions, be them positive or negative play are good drivers of shares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about t&lt;strong&gt;he impacts the attention economy has on the format of the content published&lt;/strong&gt;, you can read &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.frankrose.com/the-attention-economy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;This affects all form of content: blog posts of course, but even videos and pictures. Allow to dive into one weird, disturbing and yet very telling example to show what the end-results can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-weird-world-of-kidsyoutube&#34;&gt;The weird world of Kids’ Youtube
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content optimized to maximize the attention-grabbing and virality potential are plenty and diverse. So far, we talked about articles, yet as seen in the infographics at the beginning of the article, the volume of video content posted and shared is ever increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

A weird, potentially computer-generated kid video on Youtube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is currently plagued with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;weird kids videos that depict graphical, shocking and stressful content.&lt;/a&gt; Because of the suggestions and the autoplay, kids using YouTube can stumble upon one of such starting their visit from a innocent cartoon video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some YouTubers produce disturbing knock-off videos based on characters kids love, such as Peppa Pig. Then, &lt;strong&gt;they game the algorithm with stuffed titles and descriptions to emerge&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal is ultimately to handle channels with a large following and views so that they can, once again, maximize ads revenues. &lt;strong&gt;Attention drives monetization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;attention-economy-and-gamification&#34;&gt;Attention Economy and Gamification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different forms of incentives are tested to have highly engaged users that frequent check back their feeds**, the biggest one being gamification. It is the import of gaming reward mechanisms on non-game mediums, such as apps**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/dark-patterns-submission-by-design-6f61b04e1c92&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;They fall into Dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, a design trend we discussed in another article. They are used to nudge users to do or accept things they wouldn’t have if the information were presented to them. By adding points, achievements, unique rewards, power-ups and random reward schedule, apps and websites developers can ease the adoption of their service and increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the content we consume gets more and more engaging, we become more demanding&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and less attentive&lt;/strong&gt;. We need stories and compelling content to stay engaged. We crave bite-sized videos and short articles. At the same time, the gamification of apps is becoming a standard. It is now expected, and maybe soon necessary to create apps people understand and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-other-side-of-themirror&#34;&gt;The other side of the mirror
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the marketing world, the attention economy is qualified as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.trendone.com/en/trend-universe/mega-trends/mega-trend-detail/attention-economy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a “mega-trend”&lt;/a&gt;; a shift that manifests itself with many different macro-trends. Since &lt;strong&gt;paying for attention is no longer sufficient not reliable,&lt;/strong&gt; different trends are shaping the future of advertising and digital marketing to acknowledge this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;medium-agnostic-trends&#34;&gt;Medium-agnostic trends
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising as a service:&lt;/strong&gt; the value proposition by itself is not cutting it anymore. To increase their reach, brands aim to convince potential customers with deeds rather than words. This includes surprises, entertainment and unexpected help at the right time — in real and digital places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native Advertising:&lt;/strong&gt; regular advertisements don’t get as many eyeballs as they used to be. To reach a wider audience, the frontiers between media and advertisement are blurred. Native advertisements match the look, feel and function of the media format in which they appear. They are often found in social media feeds or as recommended content on web pages. Deception sells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storytelling:&lt;/strong&gt; brands are telling stories, and making them more compelling than ever. Using data, stories can be fine-tuned to match an audience expectation (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cio.com/article/3207670/big-data/how-netflix-built-a-house-of-cards-with-big-data.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;House of Cards&lt;/a&gt;). Stories are turning into games, and becoming increasingly more personalized and interactive. Some stories are pure myths, like Apple&amp;rsquo;s focus on privacy, yet they are widely spread and believed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;/I know iPhones are sexy, but please look into&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46396/is-it-possible-to-hide-my-devices-udid-from-ios-apps/46398#46398&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Advertising ID policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;if you believe Apple really care about your privacy./&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;expanding-the-marketing-world&#34;&gt;Expanding the marketing world
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influencer Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; audience can be kickstarted by renting someone else’s. The influencer marketing offers quickly diversified and increased over the last years. There are now thousands of influencers and “micro-influencers” (niche specific) ready to place products in their content and co-create with brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proximity Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to a dramatic increase in the precision of location-tracking devices over the last years, a new form of marketing is emerging. Beacons, relying on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi are increasingly used to deliver the messages about local deals to passerby. Apple paved the way establishing the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.beaconstac.com/2018/02/how-to-run-a-powerful-proximity-marketing-campaign-on-ios/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IBeacon&lt;/a&gt; protocol and Samsung quickly followed suit. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.computerworld.com/article/3321932/social-media/google-maps-is-the-new-social-network.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Google Maps is also turning into a social network&lt;/a&gt; / advertising platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensation Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; brands are now able to harness the power of sensations and emotions better than ever before. New forms of advertising are used, such as stunts. Thanks to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;guerilla marketing&lt;/a&gt;, new spaces are also exploited like building facades or streetlights. Finally, with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_branding&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sensory branding&lt;/a&gt;, our senses are being used to promote new messages. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.shopify.com/retail/the-science-of-smell-how-retailers-can-use-scent-marketing-to-make-more-sales&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Scent marketing&lt;/a&gt; is highly effective at modulating our experiences and attract bystanders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For marketers, the attention economy is the underpinning of novel approaches to finding more intrusive and effective forms of advertising and explore new channels&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems like the plethora of content that is causing the attention shortage is not going anywhere and will keep increasing. Where does this leave us with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-problem-with-the-internet-businessmodel&#34;&gt;A problem with the Internet business model?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges of the attention economy lie with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;dominance of the advertising model&lt;/a&gt;. Advertisement is now considered as the only way to offer free services and content at scale. It doesn’t have to be this way. It was a deliberate choice, promoted by a few actors including the GAFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisements show no signs of slow down, and millions of content pieces are published every day. The demographics are simply not there to support this much content. However, marketers and content producers are surprisingly optimistic. Indeed, bots might save us: their eyeballs multiply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dark patterns: submission by design?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/dark-patterns-submission-by-design/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 09:02:04 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/dark-patterns-submission-by-design/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Dark patterns: submission by design?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever scrolled through Facebook for hours despite having other things to do? Or went through a sign up process, clicking “Next”, “Ok”, “Get Started” buttons without reading anything else? Or maybe you’ve been using an app every day for years without knowing anything about its privacy policy? Don’t worry, there is a whole science created to make sure you don’t feel bad or even question this, it bears a name and it’s discussed publicly: dark patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark design practices are very diverse in nature, but they all share a common attribute: &lt;strong&gt;nudging the users to accept, do, or share something they wouldn’t have if the information were presented to them in a non-ambiguous fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s essentially deception and dishonesty by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From deceptive wordings (such as “Don’t opt out” check-boxes) to shiny, colorful buttons opposed to boring legalese grayscale text on white background, the artifices are plenty. They involve an understanding of human psychology, such as harnessing FOMO to pressure us into making an impulsive decision or playing with timing and time pressure (the e-commerce’s beloved “Limited offer”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-kind-ofmagic&#34;&gt;A kind of magic?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magicians use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdirection_%28magic%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt; to draw their audience attention in order to screen from detection certain details for which secrecy is required. They attract the attention to one thing to distract it from another. Dark design patterns are used to achieve the same effect. Except that this time the goal of the trick is not to entertain you, but to harvest your data, manipulate your thinking processes or your votes, make you an app-addict, or just to make you buy things you do not need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magicians face their audience when they perform the deception; they have no trouble sleeping at night. They use their art to enchant. &lt;strong&gt;If they used it to steal, it would no longer be called magic but pickpocketing.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of what allowed dark design patterns to spread is the disconnection with the audience: &lt;strong&gt;such practices are developed by UX designers who don’t have to look at their audience in the eyes&lt;/strong&gt;. They merely see the conversion metrics grow and keep the grin to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-dark-patterntypology&#34;&gt;A dark pattern typology
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are nothing new. The UX designer Harry Brignull coined it eight years ago already and registered the website &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt; to call out the practice as unethical and help users recognize it as such. What’s new is the scale it reached, as we can now find dark patterns used in pretty much every major website or app. Harry Brignull even established a typology of dark patterns, all who are documented by countless examples. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-app-darkpatterns&#34;&gt;In-app dark patterns
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmshaming:&lt;/strong&gt; guilting the user into opting into something. The decline option is usually worded so that the user is shamed into compliance: who wants to click a &lt;code&gt;I am a bad person&lt;/code&gt; action link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/adblocker-guilt-trip.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden costs&lt;/strong&gt;: hiding additional costs (such as delivery) until the very last step of the purchase process. By then, the user has committed quite time to the process, and probably already inputted his credit card info. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt; might give him the nudge he needs to finish his purchase despite the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick questions&lt;/strong&gt;: framing questions to mislead the users. While reading quickly, the user might think he’s opting-out while he’s actually opting-in. It works even better when used in series alternating opt-in and opt-out like on the example below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/trick-q.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;service-level-darkpatterns&#34;&gt;Service-level dark patterns
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playbook is quite extensive yet not exhaustive; you can check out the other ones &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the software and the apps themselves, dark patterns are found all thorough products and services, from the sign up to the account deletion process. Privacy policies and terms and conditions are the dark patterns magnets. Different methods are used to make them easy to accept, hard if not impossible to truly understand and even harder (if even possible) to refuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy-intrusive options enabled by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscuring the more privacy-friendly settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threats of loss of functionality or deletion of the user account if specific settings are not chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop-ups compelling users to make certain choices, while essential information is omitted or downplayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inability to use the app or register if the privacy policy is refused (“take it or leave it” approach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dark-patterns-beyond-theapps&#34;&gt;Dark patterns, beyond the apps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dark patterns thrived and prospered on the Internet, they’re not bound to the digital world. Many subscriptions service adopt a “signing up is easy, canceling is hard” model. Once again, different tricks are used to make it as hard as possible for the user to unsubscribe, such as the threat of a high cancellation fee or making the unsubscribe process tedious. Some services even force the user to send a letter or call a given number while he registered by filling a form online. Those who work up the courage to call might face absurd business hours or agents that simply hang up on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gym clubs are among the worst when it comes to canceling subscriptions. On boards and forums online, you can find countless stories of people going through the hassle of the cancellation process. This story from a redditor is particularly insightful: it took him &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://np.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/9duble/i_successfully_canceled_an_la_fitness_membership/e5k7o9b/?st=jltqrwml&amp;amp;sh=040d8d01&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;4 hours and 26 phone calls to cancel his gym membership&lt;/a&gt;, and the use of several different phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-did-we-getthere&#34;&gt;How did we get there?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the frustration and even anger they generate, one might wonder how dark patterns can be so prevalent? After all, stories like the one told above are detrimental to the brand. The deceived user will not fail to share his disappointment with his friends and online once he freed himself from the trickery. Well, the short answer is that superficially, dark patterns work. If you A/B test an honest, non-deceptive form versus a dark pattern filled one, the second one will certainly land more conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
A basic form of A/B Testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When only the perimeter of their implementation (sign up form, purchase process…) is considered, dark patterns inevitably land more results than an honest approach. The harmful consequences they can unleash are delayed and at the brand level. They only come later on when people are denouncing their practices online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-whats-the-actual-hidden-cost-of-dark-patterns&#34;&gt;So, what’s the actual hidden cost of dark patterns?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of a simple risk/benefit analysis at the scale of the brand, dark patterns behind widespread are now one of the main contributing factors of massive issues, at a societal level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users are being hooked to apps&lt;/strong&gt;: the dark patterns are engineered to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;encourage users to form addictive habits&lt;/a&gt; to the apps they interact with. These apps use diverse techniques such as abusive notifications (“We haven’t seen you in a while!”), or feeds implementing a variable schedule of rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal data are collected at an unprecedented pace and scale&lt;/strong&gt;, and privacy is getting harder and harder to achieve. Free apps and social network harvest data and share them with a vast network of data brokers who profit from trading people’s personal information. In 2015, data brokering was already a $200 billion industry. This activity is lawful, but the users are mostly unaware of it or its extent thanks to misleading interfaces — this pattern bears the name of Facebook’s founder: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Privacy Zuckering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data collected makes it possible to target ads and communication so precisely that we reach a point where &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;free will is put back into question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of dark design and other privacy-intrusive practices are already there, and their effect will be felt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-reclaim-our-digitallives&#34;&gt;How to reclaim our digital lives?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals concerned about privacy are forced to work at well, an individual level so far. They look into the software they use and prefer open-source whenever it’s possible. They double check every piece of hardware they get and quite often have to disable several features (Wifi, Bluetooth…) to not compromise their privacy. To learn more about how to protect your privacy online, you can check the resources from the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, at a societal level the answers are lackluster if not inexistent. The laws are still very lax, and many of the patterns described before are still lawful. There were many talks about GDPR this year, but despite being more restrictive than previous regulations, it has &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/policy/data/exemptions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many exemptions&lt;/a&gt; and is overall insufficient to protect individual consumers against privacy-intrusive companies like Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we left with? In situations where privacy is an absolute necessity, some tools are available, yet they have a steep learning curve as they do not share the friendly UX of their privacy-intrusive counterpart. Individuals who are unfamiliar with such solutions have no other option than going analog if they are not willing to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ssd.eff.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;train themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-tech-fight-techsabuses&#34;&gt;Can tech fight tech’s abuses?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the laws won’t suffice to ensure individuals’ protection, some people are looking for solutions to trigger an ethical revolution in the tech space itself. It means that we’ll need not only new tools but a complete overall of the internet business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding privacy and traceability of the data we share, the decentralized ledgers such as blockchain-based systems might provide a credible solution. They offer interesting features to regain control over our digital lives, such as censorship and attack resistance, or fault tolerance. Different projects are emerging to solve the several problems we currently face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical advertising and privacy protection: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brave.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable and decentralized identity management: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.civic.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uport.me/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uPort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial privacy: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.getmonero.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/dark-patterns/bat.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such systems are still under development and far from mainstream adoptions. In the meanwhile, the way we design digital interfaces needs to change: can there be such a thing as bright design? We can at least see how it would look like: transparent, honest, and empowering the users instead of deceiving them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Edge of the Static Web</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-edge-of-the-static-web/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-edge-of-the-static-web/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This article is the second of a series which examines the technical reasons behind the renewed interest for static websites, from both a content writer and a developer perspective. It also provides you with useful tools and services to build a static website. If you want to learn more about the macro perspective behind the shift toward the static web, feel free to read:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/&#34; &gt;Static web - back to the roots?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-websites-serve-their-purpose-better&#34;&gt;Static websites serve their purpose better
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s leave the tech aside for a second and take a step back. What&amp;rsquo;s the first goal of a website? Let me gonna risk the &amp;ldquo;to be seen and read&amp;rdquo; answer. So then how can speed and performance be so much overlooked? It&amp;rsquo;s a direct factor in the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider for instance the New York Times, which is far from the worst in terms of development practices. Let&amp;rsquo;s load the same page (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/section/health&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Health Section&lt;/a&gt;) in two different &amp;ldquo;versions&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full one, including all trackers, ads, and unnecessary scripts. Rendered using Chrome, private browsing with no extensions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cleaned one, using Firefox and several extensions to remove most advertisements, tracking and other unnecessary scripts.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tests were realized on my laptop with a connection speed of ~7 Mbps upload/download.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the eloquent results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FULL/BLOATED VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAREBONE/SUFFICIENT VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBSERVED Δ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAGE WEIGHT (MB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;4.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;79% lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB OF REQUESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;295&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;91.5% lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOAD TIME (S)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;2.07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;60 % lower&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results we observe are consistent with our experimentations. &lt;strong&gt;Static websites are about 10 times lighter than their dynamic counterpart.&lt;/strong&gt; So how comes dynamic became the standard, especially during the 2005-2015 period where the connection speeds were still limited?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-the-dynamic-heresy&#34;&gt;From the Dynamic Heresy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think about this from today&amp;rsquo;s perspective, the whole thing is absurd - the very existence of WordPress is essentially senseless, considering its primary usage. Instead of looking at the issue from the perspective of static websites being relevant, it&amp;rsquo;s much clearer with the tables shifted: &lt;strong&gt;dynamic websites are unnecessary in 95% of their current usage scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are specific situations where having a dynamic website is a necessity - any case you want to render a user input for instance, like a forum or a board. &lt;strong&gt;However, the default behavior should be to build a static website&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if your content is static (= rarely changed once published, like most websites), why choose a dynamic engine? All your users see the same pages every time. So, using a dynamic engine &lt;strong&gt;means that it forces a computation on both the server and user side every time a page is rendered&lt;/strong&gt;: it is incredibly wasteful and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a static website is built once on deployment and then simply served to all its viewers. It dramatically reduces the resource and network usage both for the server and the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did we get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;rsquo;s a tricky question but &lt;strong&gt;mostly a matter of convenience.&lt;/strong&gt; Back in 2005 and until recently, dynamic websites were all the rage. New frameworks were popping up everywhere, and clients wanted to offer an incredible experience on their website, often at the expense of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when a developer was tasked with building a new website, he would look at the available building blocks and find shiny dynamic rendering engines. Going static back them was almost like reinventing the wheel with each development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-the-static-serenity&#34;&gt;To the Static Serenity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;organic-performance&#34;&gt;Organic Performance
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall speed and resource usage of a website have a tremendous impact on its organic performance. It was true 10 years ago, but it is even more now with the rise of mobile — &lt;strong&gt;poor performance destroys the average time on page, therefore annihilating the CTR&lt;/strong&gt; (Click-Through-Ratio)… That is if the page manages to rank in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in SEO for the last few years, and I already so considerable shifts in the industry. When I started, we could grab the first spot with a well-written and researched content piece on a long-trend keyword, using a bare WordPress and requiring little to no backlinks. Nowadays the competition is intense: every detail counts, and none can be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A website performance is like a K-factor affecting all potential interactions users can have with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms like WordPress emerged to allow people to create websites without having to worry about this. Paradoxically, after years of development, such frameworks are now so bloated that they require an intense and complex optimization process — they are no longer accessible to non-tech profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;most static website generators are able to build websites complying with SEO best practices, out of the box&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes sitemap.xml/robots.txt generation, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, Schema.org (rich previews), taxonomies, href lang/multilingual markup and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we reached the current weird situation where despite WordPress&amp;rsquo; relative simplicity, the most straightforward option to build a blog that will be read is actually to create a static website, even for non-developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-websites---resources-and-services&#34;&gt;Static Websites - Resources and Services
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the data, you might be considering a switch to static? Welcome aboard! The next section introduces resources that will help you build a blazing fast and optimized static website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of Jekyll in 2008, the framework adopted by GitHub, static websites are gaining traction. New frameworks and services have been developed to facilitate the conception of a static website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-websites-engines&#34;&gt;Static Websites Engines
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Logo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Framework&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/jekyll.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Jekyll Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ruby&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Available as a Gem or integrated with GitHub Pages. Jekyll is fast and efficient but offers minimal features out of the box. Many plugins are offering additional functionalities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/gatsby.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Gatsby Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Along with Jekyll, Gatsby is the most popular static website framework. It offers very good performance and a large range of plugin as well as integrations with many third-party services.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/hugo.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hugo Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Go&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hugo puts forward its impressive performance, especially while building large websites. It offers anything you need to build a website compliant with SEO best practices out of the box.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/hexo.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hexo Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hexo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NodeJS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another fast static website generator with a built-in package manager to install plugins and themes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/pelican.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Pelican Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Python&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pelican is another interesting alternative for pythonistas however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as many much third-party resources available (themes, plugins…) as the previous ones.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static websites are also a perfect fit for documentation or e-books. Some frameworks were explicitly developed for the purpose, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.gitbook.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitBook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docusaurus.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Docusaurus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/gitbook-screen.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;GitBook Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Preview of a website built with GitBook&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to explore all potential options, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check this excellent, exhaustive database&lt;/a&gt; maintained by netlify (more about them below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-management-system&#34;&gt;Content Management System
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your website is up and running, you might want to implement a content management system so that your editor can easily submit new pieces of content. If you are a developer building a blog for yourself, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need a CMS. However, they are convenient for those who make sites maintained my non-technical profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/forestry-screen.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;forestry CMS&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Preview of the editor interface on Foresty&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-git-repository-the-base-cms&#34;&gt;A Git repository, the base CMS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Github (or Gitlab) repo as your CMS comes with many advantages over a traditional CMS, including among others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version control,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User and permission management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branches (staging, pre-prod, prod)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the full files&amp;rsquo; history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can seem intimidating if you have non-technical profiles interacting with your website, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be: &lt;strong&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the Git CLI to push a commit,&lt;/strong&gt; they can do all of it from Github&amp;rsquo;s website. We cover in depths the writing/editing flow of static websites in 🔴 -&amp;gt; StaticWebsite_MKT.md /WN/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alternative-cms&#34;&gt;Alternative CMS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a git repo is too limited for your needs, you can consider one of the following alternatives. They are all built on top of a repo, so using a git repo as CMS should be your first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Logo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/netlify.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Netlify Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.netlifycms.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Netlify CMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A CMS built for static website generator able to integrate with the most common frameworks. Netlify is a pretty exhaustive suite of services for static websites including tools for CD/CI, user management (CMS), forms and images management.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/forestry.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Forestry Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forestry.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A compelling alternative to Netlify that focuses on the UX of the editor. Forestry is a great choice if you are looking for a visual CMS to facilitate the contributions of non-tech profiles to a static website. Forestry also includes other tools, as Netlify does.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/vapid.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Vapid Logo&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vapid.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a third alternative that focuses on simplicity. Vapid is a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; CMS, made &amp;ldquo;for people who build websites for other people&amp;rdquo;. Vapid is easy to customize and maintain, as it only uses HTML tags to function.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-integration--deployment&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration &amp;amp; Deployment
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and Forestry offer a continuous deployment service integrated with their CMS. They are usually the two most suitable options if you are building a website that will be maintained by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are simply looking for a CI/CD solution and don&amp;rsquo;t need the CMS you can either use Netlify without its CMS component or consider the usual CI/CDs services that all offer resources facilitating the support for static websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Logo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Resource&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

        <title>Static web - back to the roots?</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 09:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/static-web-back-to-the-roots/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This article goes back to the early years of the web to understand why dynamic websites are so prevalent today. Then, we consider what static websites bring in terms of performance, editing speed, and organic results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the web was static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early days Internet was a place for tinkerers. Despite the frequent comparisons between MySpace and Facebook, the two services are fundamentally different. They are also a &lt;strong&gt;good representation of the &amp;ldquo;Internet Paradigm&amp;rdquo; of their respective time of fame&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are social networks, yet creating a page on MySpace required a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. The service was launched in 2003 after all. On the other hand, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s easy to use interface contributed to its success and helped it reach 2+ billion users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the MySpace/Facebook antagonism lies on the most critical point of tension on the internet - &lt;strong&gt;how to interact with the content we edit?&lt;/strong&gt; There are mostly two ways to look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)&lt;/strong&gt; — As the name suggests, in this paradigm the goal is to have an editor as close as the final rendering. WordPress was one of the most visible early proponent of WYSIWYG, but others joined. The Medium editor (featured below), built using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;, is now regarded as one of the best WYSIWYG experience available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency First&lt;/strong&gt; — WYSIWYG editors are easy to get started with but tend to be either clunky or limited. Ultimately, introducing some form of syntax adds complexity, but it also allows more control over the final rendering of the content. Moreover, since the formatting is enforced with syntax (HTML, CSS, Markdown…), it&amp;rsquo;s no longer dependent on the editor used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/mediumeditor.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Medium Editor&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dawn-of-wordpress&#34;&gt;The Dawn of WordPress
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WordPress quickly took over the web: it currently holds about 60% of the CMS market share. WordPress is so commonplace that we can even look at it from a venture point encompassing the whole web: &lt;strong&gt;about a third of all websites use WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success does not mean relevance. Indeed, power users are leaving WordPress in drove for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing&lt;/strong&gt;: The WP Editor, even the new Guttenberg, is a pain. It&amp;rsquo;s slow, clunky, and comes with a convoluted block logic. Using it to format and edit content results in a pure waste of time considering the alternative options. Besides, it does not support any &amp;ldquo;smart feature&amp;rdquo; by default such as footnotes or tables of content. They require an absurdly complex workflow or yet another plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of its success, WordPress is a prime target for hackers. Any large WP-based website will have to implement additional measures (plugins?) to handle different types of attacks. Moreover, WordPress supports all version of PHP ranging from 5.2.4 (released 12 years ago) to 7.2. Cross this with all the potential plugins and themes, and you get an endless list of attack vectors. Here is an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kinsta.com/blog/is-wordpress-secure/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;overview of the most common ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Out of the box, WordPress performance is atrocious. With some plugins (cache, CDN…) and other settings you can speed it up - but is it your job? &lt;strong&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t the point of a web framework to minimize the optimization effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugin Bloat&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of all the plugins WordPress requires, it ends up slowing down the website and hindering security. &lt;strong&gt;A fresh WP install needs 5-10 plugins to be usable and 10-15 to be &amp;ldquo;optimized&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-it-static&#34;&gt;Make It Static!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when WordPress was released in 2003, the competition was unconvincing. However, this was 15 years ago. In the meanwhile, we saw exciting &lt;strong&gt;tools and frameworks emerge both to format written content and to host and render it for the end-user.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s the development of both, hand in hand, that paved the way for the static web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with editing, focusing on Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rise-of-markdown&#34;&gt;The Rise of Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While WordPress was getting fatter and fatter, alternatives developed both to host website and format content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the content, new lightweight markup languages like Markdown offer a credible alternative even for a non-technical profile. Markdown&amp;rsquo;s promise is simple: take an hour to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;master the cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; to cut down formatting time to virtually 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Markdown is reasonably straightforward, quick to master yet incredibly potent. A writer using a markdown editor and some shortcuts can write and format its content at the same time. On top of that, Markdown offers many exporting options (HTML, PDF, LaTex, Doc…) and ensures that your formatting stays consistent whatever the end format is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it might seem, but it&amp;rsquo;s not given: with markdown you can handle text-related features (footnotes, tagging, linking to a section, table of contents, diagrams and charts) at the document-level instead of having to interact with yet another layer. &lt;strong&gt;It dramatically improves the maintainability and portability of your content.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/jamstack.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;JAMStack&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-control-is-not-just-about-code-writers-love-it-too&#34;&gt;Version control is not just about code: writers love it too!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version control and git-based development rapidly developed in the software world for solid reasons. It makes the whole development process more reliable and safe. Furthermore, the user permission management system, the branch logic and the access to the full file history as well as the ability to compare files between to versions are incredibly useful to avoid breaking changes or fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the developers got all these fancy new tools, us writers were still editing our articles in Word to copy paste it in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor and then start our formatting struggle. Why not share the goodies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as paradoxical as it can seem, a Github repo makes for a very compelling CMS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy User/Access Management&lt;/strong&gt;. The branch logic fits the editing process. For instance, if there is a need to keep a tight grip over the content published, the merging power on the master branch can be granted only to the chief editor to ensure consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branch Logic&lt;/strong&gt;: while using a repo as a CMS, branches can serve various purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to use one branch as a staging environment so that the writers can see the final rendering of their content on their machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File History&lt;/strong&gt;: with GitHub repos, you can access the whole history of a file and easily compare two versions. It is handy, especially if your blog has a lot of different contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No setup&lt;/strong&gt;: the repository can be opened in a click. From here, another click with a service like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/deploy-button/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; is enough to have a blog up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-the-lack-of-performance-lies-exclusion&#34;&gt;Beyond the lack of performance lies exclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we stayed very pragmatic as we addressed static websites&amp;rsquo; benefits in terms of performance or increased efficiency. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and consider the big picture for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average website size is now well over 3 MB&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (as 2017). &lt;strong&gt;More the size itself, the macro-level issue lies in the trend&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is the evolution of the average website page since 2011 for reference&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2019/staticweb/pagebloat.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Web performance page bloat&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a reference for comparison on blog.call.tech, our homepage weights 10 KB and an average page (image included) weights about 400 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I need to download a full and bloated 3+ MB page to get simple textual information that might be just a few bits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are sitting here, probably on a modern laptop/smartphone with a decent connection. What about those who live in countries where the Internet service is poor? Most of the Internet is made of text; it should be lightweight. Why do I need to download a full and bloated 3+ MB page to get simple textual information that might be just a few bits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mind-the-people-using-your-websites&#34;&gt;Mind the people using your websites
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a first world problem; in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s a terrible third world problem. &lt;strong&gt;Poorly designed websites result in the exclusion of regular people from services they could benefit from.&lt;/strong&gt; Moreover, the unnecessary data usage bloats the network creating congestions, higher demands and eventually pushing the price of the service up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us go as far as stating this: &lt;strong&gt;publishing an unnecessary dynamic website in 2019 is an abuse of a common good.&lt;/strong&gt; The Internet network is a shared resource, why don&amp;rsquo;t we try to avoid another tragedy of the commons using nothing more than common sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;slow-websites-are-lonely&#34;&gt;Slow websites are lonely
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let us merely ask a question to those who design those websites 12-times more massive than they should be: why so much hate? In perfect conditions, &lt;strong&gt;the average Internet user with his 7.2 MB/s average connection will need more than 3 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact? Neil Patel, a well-known figure in the SEO community, produced a very comprehensive info-graphics covering this topic.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He estimates that &lt;strong&gt;40% (53% on mobile) of users abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.&lt;/strong&gt; So crossing the two numbers, you get the following absurdity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News, media and other sites are loosing up to 40% of their potential traffic because of their poor performance stemming from their baseless choice of a dynamic rendering engine. This figure does not include the organic traffic lost because of a lack of SEO-compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s skim the fat. Do we need this many scripts? How could having a dynamic engine continuously regenerating the same static content have become the standard of the Internet? Is this really this hard to implement proper handling of images (resizing, compression, load order) in 2019?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could having a dynamic engine continuously regenerating the same static content have become the standard of the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started-with-the-static-web&#34;&gt;Getting started with the static web
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are convinced that static websites will become commonplace shortly. In the meantime, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to beat a bloated dynamic website at the SEO-game using a static one: now it the time to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo was a fit for our tech blog as it helped us streamline the content editing process while achieving impressive organic results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the offer of static website generators and other related services greatly expanded since the release of Jekyll in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/blockchains-meet-telecommunications-opportunity-risk-or-a-necessity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/blockchain-telco/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Blockchains meet Telecommunications: Opportunity, Risk, or A Necessity?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the telecom industry benefit from blockchains and decentralized ledger technologies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies are set to revolutionize many industries. While the technical component themselves are nothing new, the blockchain mixes them up in a previously unexplored layout that enables &lt;strong&gt;many new use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, blockchains are a new kind of live and self-updating databases exploring new models of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into blockchains applied to the telco industry, let’s address some of the most critical dimensions of blockchains. We’ll then be able to consider the potential &lt;strong&gt;use cases blockchains enable for the telecommunication industry&lt;/strong&gt; with live examples of existing projects whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-3-minutes-intro-to-blockchains&#34;&gt;A 3 minutes intro to blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-blockchains&#34;&gt;What are blockchains?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains (and others distributed ledger technologies known as DLT) allow nurturing different relationships between service/data providers and their users. The main innovation carried by blockchains lie in their &lt;strong&gt;distributed nature&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through game-theory mechanics and cryptographic seals, blockchains offer a credible solution to the challenge of &lt;strong&gt;maintaining a database without having a central authority&lt;/strong&gt; (such as an institution) warranting its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a &lt;strong&gt;network of peers&lt;/strong&gt; review the transactions and the ones that are validated are added to the chain. Checking mechanisms can vary depending on the needs and use cases solved by the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining is the most well known of such mechanism, and currently used by the most prominent project such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blockchains are irreversible. Once a change is validated and reviewed by the peers maintaining the network, it cannot be altered. Each new “blocks” added after makes it even less likely to be modified. Each transaction added to the chain is &lt;strong&gt;time-stamped&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cryptographically sealed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all transactions are public and &lt;strong&gt;auditable&lt;/strong&gt; — anyone can check at any time which block is validated, when, by whom, and what transactions it contains (emitting address, receiving address and amount transferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the peer-validation mechanism, the cryptographic seal, and the transparency offered by the blockchain’s publicity makes them &lt;strong&gt;“trustless”&lt;/strong&gt;: their users don’t need to trust a central body to proceed the transaction, as it doesn’t exist. Besides, since the book is public, anybody can verify that there is no foul play.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Potential benefits of blockchain (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=10f56b96-b249-4621-949c-f25514fc127a&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-blockchains-have-tooffer&#34;&gt;What do blockchains have to offer?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockchain was initially developed to offer an alternative to centralized monetary systems, with projects such as Bitcoin or Litecoin which got a lot of press. However, the &lt;strong&gt;decentralized, transparent and auditable ledgers&lt;/strong&gt; offered by blockchains-based system allow for many innovative use cases in diverse industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;the missing technological block enabling the switch&lt;/strong&gt; between systems with several levels of intermediation, each level requiring trust and creating a potential for abuses and manipulations to more direct and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By autonomous, we’re not picturing the artificial intelligence-fueled self-deciding robot fantasy but quite the opposite: peer-driven systems with enough checks and balances built-in so that they won’t require external forces (such as laws) to maintain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain-based technologies are still at a very &lt;strong&gt;early stage of development&lt;/strong&gt; and not yet able to achieve this vision. However, they are not to dismiss altogether until further advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limitations of our current AI systems, we’ve found many use-cases them for them. They still fail dramatically at complex task involving several interlaced processes, but perform quite well with a very narrow and well-defined scope: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40042581&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;beating the world’s Go champion,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.asmag.com/showpost/24046.aspx&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;traffic monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;trivia games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its early stage, blockchains-based systems are bound for similar implementations. They will &lt;strong&gt;take over well-defined scope&lt;/strong&gt; within industries, starting with positions where there is a significant need for traceability and transparency and the current share taken by intermediaries is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-in-practice-usecases&#34;&gt;Blockchains in practice: use cases
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust is the cornerstone of the business. Blockchains enable &lt;strong&gt;trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution&lt;/strong&gt;. It will streamline relationships between partners and reduce frictions between the various stakeholders involved in a given system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decentralized dimension of blockchain-based systems, if maintained, could foster a new kind of trust that is no longer based on the reputations of the actor but instead rely on the &lt;strong&gt;credibility gathered by the systems themselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;so-what-are-blockchains-goodfor&#34;&gt;So, what are blockchains good for?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could ease and empower identity verification processes, allowing users to control easily and precisely which data piece is shared, when and with whom. &lt;br&gt;
It could also facilitate cross-industries interconnections between different systems, reduce abuses both on the user-side (identity-theft) and on the businesses sides (fraud).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment processing&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain-based systems can power payment networks with novel and exciting characteristics. Transactions can be validated in a near instantaneous fashion (&amp;lt;10s) while processing fees are so low than micro-transactions can be considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription management&lt;/strong&gt;: blockchain could finally fulfill the promise of a subscription as easy as it to terminate it. Standards are currently drafted (such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/948&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ERC-948&lt;/a&gt;) to allow services providers to offer subscriptions that would be blockchain-based. &lt;br&gt;
Such subscriptions would be easy to manage from the user side. They also provide a predictable revenue stream to the service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data tracking and validation&lt;/strong&gt;: thanks to blockchain the cryptographic seal and data verification process, it could help to facilitate the validation of data, be it from sensors or other devices. The verification mechanisms can guarantee the data is coming from an authenticated and well-functioning device. &lt;br&gt;
This will prevent detrimental decisions based on corrupted data. The data will be time-stamped and easily auditable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/strong&gt;: the IoT requires sound authentication and data sharing processes to develop. Just like the identity management use case, blockchain could facilitate and provide a backbone for the authentication of machines and their data exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These five high-level use cases for blockchains can unfold in many different industries, triggering new developments are a power redistribution. For the rest of the article, we’ll limit ourselves to the telco industry and consider the main activities that could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-use-cases-for-the-telcoindustry&#34;&gt;Blockchains use cases for the telco industry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications of blockchains based technologies presented in the previous sections to the telecom industry are plenty. Some are quite obvious, as they provide an alternative to already existing solutions. Others require more abstraction to be considered since they involved several use cases nested with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;devices-identification&#34;&gt;Devices Identification
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of SIM cards currently permits the identification of devices on cellular networks. While the technology has its merits (especially cost-efficiency), it might not be the most adapted for 5G and device-to-device networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;public-key cryptography&lt;/a&gt; logic, implemented in blockchain systems might offer a credible alternative to solve the challenges posed by the &lt;strong&gt;dynamic authentication of potentially billions of (autonomous) devices&lt;/strong&gt; on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication on existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin relies on &lt;strong&gt;a pair of keys&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public key is the public ID of the recipient&lt;/strong&gt;. For bitcoin, it is used to receive payment. It works like an email address: anybody that knows it can send money to it, but only the owner of the related private key can generate a transaction from this address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The private key is used to verify ownership of the address.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing with the email comparison, the private key would be the password of the email address. It is required to send emails (initiate transactions) from that address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to eSIM, embedded SIM card, a virtual SIM standard, is already happening: the latest generation of Apple devices are supporting the standard. Since the SIM card is no longer physical, strong security standards are necessary to prevent abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a blockchain-based authentication protocol could ensure the &lt;strong&gt;safe authentication&lt;/strong&gt; while also allowing for greater &lt;strong&gt;flexibility and interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identity-as-a-service-and-data-management&#34;&gt;Identity as a Service and Data Management
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchains are particularly apt to enable tighter control of users over their data. In the wake of Cambridge Analytica, and other data over-sharing and data breaches related scandal (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;), consumers are realizing how exposed their data can be and &lt;strong&gt;the lack of control their have over it&lt;/strong&gt;, once they hand it to a service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom industry actors and particularly mobile service providers could play a role to prevent further scandals and breaches from happening. They could provide consummers with the next generation of data management services (Identity as a Service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced projects, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.civic.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uport.me/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uPort&lt;/a&gt; are looking to reshape the way we share data online. Their users create a blockchain-backed identity and populate it with the pieces of information they are willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such identity can be represented by the address of a smart contract or a traditional public key. Since other smart contracts can control smart contracts, they can be programmed to support various methods of key recovery logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mobile-data-reselling&#34;&gt;Mobile data reselling
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since telecommunication networks are built on top of legacy implementations, some usage situations can get almost nonsensical. For instance, if a French (with a French mobile/data plan) travels with his phone to the US and browse the web, all his traffic will be routed through France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interconnection cost for the service provided, as well as the margin taken by the operator dramatically increase the price he has to pay. He could purchase data from a local instead. Using a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic data reselling network&lt;/strong&gt;, he can get the data bandwith he needs from a nearby American with some spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be able to browse in a much more cost-effective fashion. Thanks to the transactional capabilities of blockchain based systems, they are excellent candidates to power a worldwide data reselling network.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;DENT&lt;/a&gt; which connects to over 400 mobile operators in 130 countries. They aim to accelerate the decrease of roaming fees, to bring them as close as possible to the operational costs. DENT or other similar projects are looking to make use of the spare capacity available on the network and data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-sourcing-and-decentralizing-the-telecommunication-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Open-sourcing and decentralizing the telecommunication infrastructure
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of supplementing the current telco infrastructure, some projects are more ambitious. Their goal is to build a &lt;strong&gt;brand new and decentralized infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of such projects believe that a decentralized network would be more apt to sustain the growing data needs while offering more security guarantees to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://qlcchain.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;QLCChain project&lt;/a&gt; dubs itself as “decentralized network as a service”. They set to construct an open-source telecom infrastructure on the blockchain. The network is powered by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardware&lt;/strong&gt; (BaseStation),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; enabling the transaction of network services and the execution of smart contracts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as well as &lt;strong&gt;a token (QLC)&lt;/strong&gt; to structure the exchanges of value within the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is currently testing the network, looking to open it to the public by the end of the year. Here is a high-level overview of their network infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-telco-related-blockchain-usecases&#34;&gt;Other telco-related blockchain use cases
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology develops, new use cases are enabled. We presented four credible and interesting ones that can turn into massively used services in a relatively near future. There are however many other use cases that could be envisioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing intermediaries involved in services such as &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name Service&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NAT&lt;/a&gt;), or even fully decentralize them. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://peername.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Several solutions are already implemented&lt;/a&gt; to replace traditional DNS on the web and provide a name service to resolve public keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring &lt;strong&gt;credit reselling&lt;/strong&gt; of internet-level communication networks, particularly for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.callr.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;VoIP resellers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, creating a protocol to resell minutes of voice communication over the VoIP network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transparency provided by blockchains, as well as their resistance to attacks and alteration makes them a perfect fit for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/07/blockchain-for-fraud-prevention-industry-use-cases/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fraud prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits-for-industryactors&#34;&gt;Benefits for industry actors
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As blockchain-based technologies mature, they will enable &lt;strong&gt;new revenue streams and partnership opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; for existing telecommunication service and network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of blockchain based networks and services will dramatically &lt;strong&gt;change the balance of power and profit between existing intermediaries.&lt;/strong&gt; New partnerships will be formed, some legacy intermediaries might become obsolete and replaced by cheaper, faster and more effective alternative. Skipping such intermediaries will streamline operations and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the financial dimension of the telecommunication operations, blockchains enable many opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Near real-time settlements&lt;/strong&gt; offered by digital payment systems will simplify accounting procedures and reduce operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new validation mechanisms provided by blockchain will streamline accountability even further. Instead of relying on disparate systems to find and collate different financial views, a blockchain ledger will provide &lt;strong&gt;one unified view covering almost all transactions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain is still at an early development stage. The main challenge right now is to correctly identify relevant and realistic upcoming opportunities to direct developments and investments purposely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further the impact of blockchain and telcos, check out the paper published by Deloitte’s Blockchain Institute: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/za_TMT_Blockchain_TelCo.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;governments-vs-lex-cryptographica&#34;&gt;Governments VS. Lex Cryptographica
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal framework surrounding such system is currently lax, if not wholly lacking. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;most of&lt;/strong&gt; existing &lt;strong&gt;regulations focused on the financial use cases of blockchains&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Initial Coin Offering (~IPO for tokens). While this is perceived as a risk by most legacy industries actors, others see it as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since control mechanisms are built into blockchain-based systems, there might be no need for laws once they systems are mature enough. Such systems could &lt;strong&gt;implement their own regulatory frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;. The Harvard University Press published a fascinating read addressing the topic earlier this year. What follows is a quote taken from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Blockchain technology facilitates the emergence of new self-contained and autonomous systems of rules that create order without law and implement what can be thought of as private regulatory frameworks, which we refer to as *lex cryptographica*.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is stability a necessity for cryptocurrencies mainstream adoption?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Is stability a necessity for cryptocurrencies mainstream adoption?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you talk about cryptocurrencies with people unfamiliar with it, the question of volatility is among the first to pop up. Quite often, it’s a low effort way to dismiss the whole world of cryptocurrencies and recent progress made with decentralization. Volatility does not affect all cryptocurrencies: some of them are made to be stable (price wise) — we call them the “stablecoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that point, let’s state some necessary facts to understand this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies are much more than just the Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more than 1500 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap, which is only the tip of the iceberg: in reality, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies circulating. The sheer amount of tokens can be scary, but it’s positive in the long run. It means that for every problem cryptocurrencies can solve you have dozens of different teams exploring as many different approaches — no stone is left unturned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever the initial vision of Satoshi was, &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin is unfit to become a mainstream currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Its technical limitation such as its low transaction speed or the issues with mining (energy consumption, centralization, etc.) makes it inapt for this use case. However, its persistence (Bitcoin is almost 10 years old!) as well as its reliability makes it a good “store of value”, just like gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, there are many projects with the ambition to become tomorrow’s mainstream currency. &lt;strong&gt;They answer the fundamental issue raised when considering Bitcoin as a currency: its volatility.&lt;/strong&gt; Those projects are called &lt;strong&gt;stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; and they will be the topic of this piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of volatility highlights a vital characteristic of a currency: price stability is a necessity to have a currency people feel confident using. Indeed, creating a new currency requires a thorough understanding of both technical mechanisms as well as social dynamics. In order &lt;strong&gt;to become a currency, a good must be recognized as such by its users and gain their trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-fiat-goingsouth&#34;&gt;Are fiat going south?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a strong correlation between the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the “weakness” of the national currency (called fiat currencies) in a given country. It’s hard to measure the adoption of cryptocurrency, but we can easily get figures on how many people are interested in buying some using Google Trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghanaian currency (the Cedi — GHS) went from roughly a dollar in 2008 to around 20 cents nowadays. Meanwhile, the Nigerian currency (the Naira — NGN) lost about half of its worth (measured against the dollar).&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;TradingEconomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devaluation happened fast enough for people living in these countries to see the impact of it. It could explain the strong interest we observe for cryptocurrencies in Ghana and Nigeria. However, the issue with the determining how much a given currency is worth is more complex than simply measuring it against the dollar. If we use the dollar as our reference point, we must question its stability: &lt;strong&gt;is the dollar itself even stable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice about it, the “yes” seems like the go-to answer. The dollar hasn’t changed over these last 50 years — a $1 bill emitted in 1968 would still be recognized as such today. However, what about its worth? It is changing all the time. Is one 1968 dollar still worth $1 then? The answer is simply no — it would give access to a purchasing power corresponding to roughly 7 present days dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the spread is of course inflation. The topic is sophisticated enough to have theses written about it, so we’ll leave it to others. Now that we have some context let’s get back to stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-a-stablecoin&#34;&gt;What’s a stablecoin?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the stablecoin is pretty simple, the challenge lies in the execution. &lt;strong&gt;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that trades at a fixed price against a good (such as gold) or a common currency (most often the dollar).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stablecoin’s worth is not stable; it is merely its value that is pegged to a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable asset. Creating a reliable stablecoin is already a real challenge, so creating a fixed-worth currency is a wild dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the question of having a stable value is interesting to consider. How would it look like? That one unit of the given currency is always worth one unit? That’s DOGE’s specialty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/stablecoins/doge.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to more serious matters: the stability of currency could be defined as the fact that one unit of it always grant access to the same value. This definition would be consistent with the definition of a currency proposed in a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better-3b8e66cd2e77&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the link between the currency and the actual value it gives access to is elegant, in theory. However, in the real world, it’s close to impossible to measure the buying power of a given currency exactly. It is why we’ll consider stability defined as a currency keeping a constant price in regards to other goods or currencies which have a &lt;strong&gt;relatively&lt;/strong&gt; stable value. Before we get to the different stablecoin projects there are, let’s examine their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-stablecoins-goodfor&#34;&gt;What are stablecoins good for?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have live and available stablecoins such as the USDT. They are mostly used by crypto exchanges and traders because they offer a way to avoid returning to fiat currencies and having to abide by all the legal framework that comes with it. Moreover, since their price is fixed against the dollar they are somewhat of a safe haven for traders: with them, they can get out of the market without really doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, stablecoins are mostly a traders’ gimmick used to get in and out of the market without bringing their money back into their bank account. Hence, &lt;strong&gt;in the short-term, they are mostly a speculative tool&lt;/strong&gt;. However, they can provide a real utility in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cryptocurrencies have high volatility compared to fiat currencies, they are not really used as currency. Almost nobody is choosing to get their pay in cryptocurrencies, or using them to buy their groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a stable cryptocurrency well integrated with the rest of the ecosystem would provide a credible solution to address these needs. At first, stablecoins would be the gateway between the fiat and the crypto world. In the long run, they could become the “fiat of cryptos” themselves: &lt;strong&gt;they would become cryptocurrencies which are stable enough to become a preferred payment method&lt;/strong&gt;. It would provide a broader and more reliable access to the services offered by other (non-stable) cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-stabilize-a-cryptocurrency-liveexamples&#34;&gt;How to stabilize a cryptocurrency: live examples
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fulfill their promise of stable exchange rate against a given fiat, stablecoins must offer a &lt;strong&gt;collateral&lt;/strong&gt;. As a result, several types of stablecoins emerged depending on the collateral mechanism they used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fiat-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Fiat collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most direct and simple approach to make a stablecoin, but also the most centralized. In brief, there is a central entity minting the stablecoin who owns a reserve of dollar corresponding to the volume put in circulation. This dollar reserve offers guarantees regarding the solvability of the coin and allow to exchange the stablecoin back to a dollar at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, this approach comes with several issues. First, it’s &lt;strong&gt;completely centralized&lt;/strong&gt; since a single entity is emitting the stablecoin and backing it. There are no other choices but to trust it. Besides the approach is &lt;strong&gt;economically inefficient&lt;/strong&gt;, especially at scale, as it requires to “freeze” an amount of money equal to the number of stablecoins in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USDT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is used by the USDT, the most widespread stablecoin. Despite its adoption, &lt;strong&gt;the USDT is widely denounced&lt;/strong&gt; for its lack of transparency — there is no reliable method allowing its users to verify than Tether (the institution emitting USDT) actually possesses in its reserve a stock of dollar corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation: around 2,8 billion currently. However, the ties between Tether and Bitfinex (the 4th cryptocurrency exchange regarding the trading volume) raise questions regarding the potential for market manipulation it allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TrueUSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in answer to the lack of transparency of the USDT, TrueUSD uses the same mechanism while offering more guarantees. Rather than owning the token themselves, TrustToken (the institution emitting TrueUSD) works with a network of banks and financial institutions which keep the funds in escrow for them. One of them, Cohen&amp;amp;Company, publishes an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.trusttoken.com/trueusd-attestation-reports-86f693b90a4?gi=749091358366&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;independent audit&lt;/a&gt; twice a month to confirm that the financial partners of TrustToken do hold in escrow a number of dollars corresponding to the volume of TUSD in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guarantees offered seem more reliable than for the USDT, yet the problem is similar: this system requires its user to trust TrustToken and its partners, and particularly Cohen&amp;amp;Company to be honest. It works until it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crypto-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Crypto collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fiat collateralized stablecoins are fulfilling (so far) their promise of stability, they are doing a disservice to cryptocurrencies as a whole whose aim is to provide a decentralized alternative to the legacy financial and monetary networks. To answer this concern, another type of stablecoins emerged. They use other cryptocurrencies as collateral and a network of smart contracts to peg their exchange price to the underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this type of stablecoins is facing issues too, the main one being the volatility of cryptocurrencies used as collateral. To address them, they necessitate &lt;strong&gt;a collateral superior to the value of the stablecoins emitted&lt;/strong&gt;, which hinders their potential large scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MakerDAO — Dai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai is another stablecoin pegged to the dollar (1 Dai = $1). It has some interesting features, the main one being that it is fully decentralized. Indeed, the institution emitting the Dai is MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. It’s an &lt;strong&gt;organization which governing rules are automated and enforced through publicly auditable smart contracts&lt;/strong&gt;, making them transparent and unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dai works in pair with MKR, the governance token. Owners of MKR can vote to decide on the mechanisms used to stabilized the Dai. The system is quite complex and could deserve several articles by itself. Dai was launched on December 17th 2017 after three years of development. Since its launch, its price was in the same range of stability than fiat collateralized stablecoins (+/- ~10 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;un-collateralized-stablecoins&#34;&gt;Un-collateralized stablecoins
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stablecoins are the most promising in the long run as the address the main concerns raised by the two previous types: they propose a decentralized solution which could be used at scale. These projects are still in the development phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them use algorithms which reduce or increase the amount of the given stablecoin in circulation to stabilize their price. If the price goes over the dollar, the circulating supply increases; if it goes below, the supply decreases. The two most prominent projects in this category are Basis and Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis wants to create an “algorithmic central bank” that would stabilize its price. Their system uses three different types of token which makes it quite complex. The goal is to reproduce a simplified version of the federal reserve system with the addition of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Carbon is trying to execute an approached theorized in 2014 already by Robert Sams called the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;seigniorage shares&lt;/a&gt;. The solution is mostly theory for now and has yet to see a working implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins-a-gift-or-a-curse-for-cryptocurrencies&#34;&gt;Stablecoins: a gift or a curse for cryptocurrencies?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are a recent yet fascinating innovation. There are many projects currently in development (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stablecoinindex.com/projects/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;non-exhaustive list&lt;/a&gt;) using diverse approaches. The typology proposed above is simplified: some projects mix several types of collateral while others use radically different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, stablecoins are speculative &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tools&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; more than anything else, but they can become one of the critical elements of the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the long run. Looking at the volume, the USDT is currently obliterating its competition, which creates a systematic risk for the whole cryptocurrencies market. If USDT was to fail, it could lead to widespread panic. Thus &lt;strong&gt;speculation pushed the market towards a highly centralized tool lacking any real transparency: a gentle irony for the future of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Respecting Users Privacy - The oddity that must become a standard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, respecting your users’ privacy should be easy, right? After the revelations made by Snowden about the NSA practices and all other that followed, web hosting providers and other services changed their practices, right? That’s what we thought — and the illusion didn’t last for long. Today we take you on a little data tour: who’s collecting them, how, and for what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-thecontext&#34;&gt;SETTING UP THE CONTEXT
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might know it; else we recommend you to read the manifesto — we recently launched a publication, EcoCrypto, that respects its users and their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding their attention, that’s our issue. However, when it comes to respecting our users’ privacy, it’s much bigger than us: we must double check each third party service we use to ensure they’re not abusing our (and your) trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we published the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ecocrypto.fr/manifeste/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, we realized &lt;strong&gt;how little people knew about the systematized data harvest that happens online&lt;/strong&gt;. We decided to write an article to provide a comprehensive overview of the main tracking solution currently enforced pretty much everywhere on the web. At the end of the article, we propose two sets of recommendations. The first one is for everyone: the very basics on how to protect your privacy online. The second one is specific to webmasters: how to respect your users’ privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-trackermania&#34;&gt;THE TRACKER MANIA
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each additional tracker is one more guest at the feast held on our privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: what’s a tracker? Essentially, it’s a small script one can place on his/her website — it allows the different services used to collect data on the visitors, therefore enabling new services for the webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tracker is like a snitch for a third party — &lt;strong&gt;each additional tracker is one more guest at the feast held on our privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-small-dozen-of-trackers-theminimum&#34;&gt;A SMALL DOZEN OF TRACKERS, THE MINIMUM?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To stay true to the original article (written in French for a French public), we kept French websites as examples. The situation is similar all around the globe, even worse in some countries .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any media website is using at the very least a dozen trackers. No need to trust us, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;check by yourself using Ghostery&lt;/a&gt;: it lets easily you visualized all the trackers present on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little tracker-tour of a selection of the most visited websites in France:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leMonde.fr \[France’s #2 (audience) daily national newspaper\] — &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; different trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leFigaro.fr \[#1 Daily national newspaper\] —** 35**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediapart \[Online only publication\] — &lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;l’Express \[Weekly magazine\] — &lt;strong&gt;49&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tf1.fr \[#1 Private TV channel\] —** 35**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France2.fr \[#1 Public TV channel\] — &lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agence France Presse (AFP — French news agency) — &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the cleanest of the bunch, l’Humanité, still has &lt;strong&gt;10 different trackers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The measure was made on July the 18th, on the Homepage of every website. Remember to disable any adblocker or script blocker to see all the trackers on a given website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Elle.fr &lt;/p&gt;
\[Weekly women magazine\]
&lt;p&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;53 trackers&lt;/strong&gt;; Liberation.fr &lt;/p&gt;
\[Daily newspaper\]
&lt;p&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;40 trackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often, the people working on/for these websites don’t even know about the trackers. We reached out to French crypto publications to let them know about their privacy-intrusive practices. All said they were “surprised” to discover how extensive the net was. Some might say they were laughing at our face — you are the judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this little visit to the horror gallery we can conclude two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The owners/webmasters of 99% of internet websites are apparently not even thinking about respecting their user privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The users of these websites don’t know about the tracking and its consequences. Therefore, they don’t ask/push for practices that would be both cleaner and more respectful of their privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is any change coming up, it will come from the users: we need to be demanding and uncompromising. To do so, one must know what one is fighting against — let’s start a quick tour of some of the shadiest practices taking place in the online tracking world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-typology-of-thetrackers&#34;&gt;A TYPOLOGY OF THE TRACKERS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several different types of trackers, here’s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising trackers&lt;/strong&gt;: These trackers allow webmasters (and advertising services) to collect additional data when a user goes on a website — this data is then used to increase the effectiveness of the ads. The most common are Double Click and Facebook Ads. We’ll give more details on a subsection of the advertising trackers — the pixels — a little below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistics services trackers&lt;/strong&gt;: the most famous is Google Analytics, but there are many others. They’ll have their section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social networks trackers:&lt;/strong&gt; they allow for a direct integration of social media on a website, such as liking a Facebook page from a media website. It means that the user is identified (through his/her Facebook/Twitter/X profile). One last thing: no need to interact with the buttons to be recognized — that’s the whole beauty of the mechanism. Smile! You’re being spied on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;visitor-stats-and-an-extremely-detailedprofile&#34;&gt;VISITOR STATS… AND AN EXTREMELY DETAILED PROFILE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each webmaster has the same issue: he/she needs stats to know the most visited pages or articles, where his/her users are coming from, how many are they… To do so, the go-to is to implement Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition of Google Analytics is pretty straightforward: Google is an expert on data collection and processing, you’re probably not. Implement this little script and Google will do most of the work for you: collecting the data, processing it, or presenting it in comprehensive dashboards. It’s convenient, and most (if not all) websites now use it. The issue? All the data is going through Google, putting it another way: &lt;strong&gt;Google is now collecting data on 99% of any websites users, straight at the source (on the website).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If each website were a bar, the Google Analytics situation would be similar to having a Google Home with the mic always on at the very center of the room. It’s already annoying and problematic when it’s just a few bars/websites. However, now, since almost all websites use this mechanism, it became the web all-seeing eye / all-hearing ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who handled a website with Google Analytics implement knows what we’re talking about: the amount of data available on any user is staggering. It’s hard to give a precise number because each implementation of Google Analytics is different. Google itself boasts about its &lt;strong&gt;400 different “metrics and dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;” — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#mode=web&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here is the list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webmaster rejoice! We suggest an alternative at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-advertising-and-user-privacy-strictly-irreconcilable&#34;&gt;ONLINE ADVERTISING AND USER PRIVACY: STRICTLY IRRECONCILABLE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talked about advertising trackers, it was a rapid overview. Allow us to zoom in a little here. First, some basics about online advertising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s paid by action: cost per click, per thousand views, per specific action (register, download an app…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All actions are not equal — a click can come from someone completely outside your main target or on the contrary from the potentially perfect customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online advertising campaigns can be adjusted in real time and at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the basics are clearly stated, it’s easy to understand that there is a choice to be made between privacy and online advertising. To optimize the online ads, one must collect more and more data to improve his/her targeting and avoid unnecessary expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/privacy.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online media and social networks often get quite lyrical about their “fight to protect users’ privacy” — don’t let yourself be fooled. &lt;strong&gt;All the most visited websites are big users of online advertising services and use many trackers: in short, they have no respect for their users’ privacy. Even worse: they are making money out of its violation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spy-pixel&#34;&gt;THE SPY-PIXEL
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still unconvinced? You think that “ethical advertising” is a thing? Let us zoom on a specific kind of trackers: the advertising “Pixels,” such as the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, it’s a little script that works a bit like Google Analytics. The webmaster implements the pixel on his/her website and gain access to extra (advertising-related) statistics and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On of the main interest for webmasters is that all the data collected will be available straight in Facebook Ads — it makes it much easier to optimize the ads: it’s a mandatory tracker for anybody who is dedicating a significant budget to the platform. Thanks to the pixel, the website owner can make the connection between the ads on Facebook and actions undertook on his website: signups, purchases, downloads, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with the Facebook’s pixel is the same as Google Analytics: since the pixel is now everywhere, Facebook is collecting data right at the source on most of the most visited websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/pixel.png&#34;

An example of a retargeting scenario using Facebook (source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.lyfemarketing.com/spa-owners-facebook-customers/facebook-retargeting-example/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lyfe Marketing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the pixel allows a specific kind of advertising campaigns called “retargeting”: the term refers to any ad where the targeting is made using the previous behavior of the prospects. A typical retargeting flow using Facebook (Pixel and Ads service) looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You go to a given website, let’s say a lawnmower shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smile, someone’s is spying on you! Thanks to the pixel, you’re immediately recognized, your “Facebook ID” (unique identifier of your Facebook profile) is added to a retargeting list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You go on Facebook and discover incredible sales of lawnmower straight in your newsfeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-little-gifts-discovered-by-theway&#34;&gt;THE LITTLE GIFTS DISCOVERED BY THE WAY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into our recommendations, let us examine a concrete example that tells a lot about the challenge it became to respect the privacy of your website users online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of WordPress? It’s a framework (~engine) allowing you to create blogs and websites easily — this is what we use on EcoCrypto… for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A default WordPress installation uses a service called Gravatar: thanks to it, each user (=anybody who write articles or comment on one) can have his/her very own profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, users can go on gravatar.com, create their account and set their profile picture once — Tada! Your picture is now on every WordPress using Gravatar without having you to set it up again. Nice, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that the reality behind the gimmick is quite ugly. Gravatar uses the email to match its user with his/her profile picture. It means that &lt;strong&gt;by default, anyone commenting on a Wordpress sees his/her email getting a free round-trip to Gravatar’s servers.&lt;/strong&gt; With the round trip, Gravatar can build a list of the users of every WordPress installation — still looking for that sweet custom profile pic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many alternatives exist, and they can be set up in a few clicks, but since Gravatar is enabled on all installations, it’s still widely used. &lt;strong&gt;The default installation, combined with the widespread ignorance of the practice allows Auttomatic (Gravatar’s developers) to stuff itself with the emails of its users unknowingly collected over the years.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;To go further, here’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/44717/is-gravatar-a-privacy-risk&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;an interesting read on Gravatar’s privacy issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of scenario repeats itself over and over again when it comes to privacy. Everyone agrees with and supports the concept, yet only a few really look into it. On the business side, the “respecting your users’ privacy” theme is nothing else than a potential communication topic: it’s rarely enforced at the software level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-can-wedo&#34;&gt;SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tried to stay concise and not delve too much into the technical details — we’ve omitted many practices, this article is not exhaustive at all. Dozens, probably hundreds of different tricks and mechanisms exist to track and spy on users online. Some are much more insidious and harder to counter than others, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://panopticlick.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fingerprinting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What inspired this article is the surprisingly hard journey to set up a simple blog that respects its readers’ privacy. &lt;strong&gt;We’ve left this topic to the experts, and because of that we are reaching a situation where violating the privacy is now the norm — and those who want to respect it struggle.&lt;/strong&gt; All of this happening while Apple, Google, Facebook and others are painting themselves as “privacy champion” in front of the general audience, while they are the first to systemize the very end of the idea of privacy. We should fight back, or maybe we should have ten years ago already? It’s never too late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toolbox-the-bare-minimum-to-protect-yourprivacy&#34;&gt;TOOLBOX: THE BARE MINIMUM TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news (there is one!) is that protecting your privacy necessitates that you block all the ads — as well as the script that detects if you have an adblocker or not. Stealth has a bright side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is the bare minimum setup, you must go much further to be really covered, if ever possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-block-theads&#34;&gt;1. BLOCK THE ADS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chrome users, we recommend the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-adblocker/gabbbocakeomblphkmmnoamkioajlkfo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Adblocker&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Defender&lt;/a&gt; (anti ad-block defuser) combo: it’s easy to set up and works well. Firefox users can use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; for similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Whatever adblocker you chose, don’t forget to enable the EasyList corresponding to your country. Here’s a demo GIF for the French list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/adblock-fr.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try your setup by visiting any media website with the adblocker enabled; you’ll see a lot of free space! Insidious ads such as sponsored posts (“native advertising” as professionals call them) are not blocked — beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-list-and-block-thetrackers&#34;&gt;2. LIST AND BLOCK THE TRACKERS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads are only the start. Now we need to tackle the trackers. The good news is that there are very extensions to take care of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/user-privacy/privacy-badger.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger is developed by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/about&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the EFF — the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that has been defending civil liberties in the digital word for years — it’s not enough to blindly trust them, but it does provide reassurance. You don’t need any specific setting, but you might want to have a look at the trackers list (by clicking on the extension icon) and disable those you don’t need. At the beginning of the article, we mentioned &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ghostery.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ghostery&lt;/a&gt; — it also works quite well, and might be easier to use for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-use-https-everywhere&#34;&gt;3. USE HTTPS, EVERYWHERE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, the exchanges between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is now widespread, but its implementation on certain websites is quite messy: they’ll make you switch back and force between the secured and regular HTTP. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, another browser extension from the EFF solves the issue: it forces websites to use HTTPS whenever it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;additional-notes-on-privacytools&#34;&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTES ON PRIVACY TOOLS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be even safer, use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; Chrome. If you’re looking for sensitive stuff online, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;use TOR at least, it’s super easy to set up&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, if you want to be a little safer, look for more sensitive stuff, or leak critical information please check &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tails.boum.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TAILS — an operating system (Linux based) made for privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Before going to the dark side of the web, READ and document yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the article short-ish, we limited ourselves to three tools. &lt;strong&gt;To really cover your digital steps, you’ll have to go much further.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have easily listed a hundred of different &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tools&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; relevant for different situations — it would be pointless. You need to be able to pick the most suitable tools for your usage by yourself. To do so, there is no other way than lifting the hood to delve into the technical stuff. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy is not given nowadays; you must fight for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around the globe, nonprofits are doing their part with their means. The EFF edits a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ssd.eff.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Surveillance Self Defense guide&lt;/a&gt; which could be an excellent place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;respecting-users-privacy-as-a-webmaster&#34;&gt;RESPECTING USERS PRIVACY AS A WEBMASTER
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are handling a website, the most critical action you could start with is breaking free from Google Analytics. We have chosen &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://matomo.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Matomo&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source and &lt;strong&gt;self-hosted&lt;/strong&gt; analytics solution. The self-hosted part means that the data stays on our servers: it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your hosting provider, setting up Matomo might be more or less accessible. If your hosting provides supports &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.softaculous.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Softaculous&lt;/a&gt;, the installation will be done in a few clicks. Else, you might need to learn a thing or two on server management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other actions you can undertake will depend on the services and framework you use. Rather than a list of tools, let us suggest a methodology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party services minimization&lt;/strong&gt;: reduce to the very minimum the number of third-party services you use. Each new service is a potential risk both for your website &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/security&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and for your users’ privacy. Even a decent, honest service can go rogue in a flash, and it won’t warn you about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate any third-party service you do implement&lt;/strong&gt;: despite 1/, you’ll have to use some third-party services. Look into the developers of these services, their other products, the reviews. There might even be other people who audited their code and talked about it. Use open-source services whenever it’s possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget about online advertising&lt;/strong&gt; on the main services (Social media, Google…) — you can’t reach cost-efficiency on these services without violating your users’ privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help!&lt;/strong&gt; More and more people are getting “privacy-fluent” and would be &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;happy to help&lt;/a&gt; a well-intentioned webmaster to establish a decent setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/money-101-discarding-the-myth-of-bartering-to-understand-bitcoin-better/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Money 101 - Discarding the myth of bartering to understand Bitcoin better" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is a critical element of our modern societies: a slight change in its mechanisms can have a much broader impact than simply affecting the economy. Therefore, a better comprehension of these mechanisms will give you a better grasp on various topics ranging from Political Economy to cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a complex subject, even more lately if we consider all the &lt;strong&gt;convoluted systems and protocols&lt;/strong&gt; that were progressively built on top of it: monetary creation, central banks, inflation… With this piece, we’ll go back to the basics and eventually down to cryptocurrencies: What defines a currency? Why do we need them? What types of currencies do exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up for a quite an adventure in which we discard old but still prevalent tales and propose necessary new ones to make complex mechanisms crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-the-origins-ofmoney&#34;&gt;The Tale of the Origins of Money
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear about currencies, you often get a tale that is easy to understand and compelling; yet it’s just a tale. It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we were barterers, the my chicken for your corn kind of deal. Then, since bartering wasn’t efficient, we needed a more standardised mean of exchange: a good that could pass as a store of value. Precious metals were the perfect candidates — they became coins, a form of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, later on, those coins evolved once again and became paper money — still a currency, but the origin of their value shifted: while a coin gets its value from its very material (the precious metal it’s made of), the paper money needs an institution to emit it and guarantee its value one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the digital era, money evolved one more time. It’s now all “digital” — just bits, 0 and 1 located somewhere in a server and transiting almost instantly in the fiber network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take our time to methodically deconstruct the tale in order to dismiss it, we’ll learn quite a few things along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;money-is-not-a-store-ofvalue&#34;&gt;Money is not a store of value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is not a store of value, it’s a claim upon value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lets-burn-some-cash-to-understand-moneybetter&#34;&gt;Let’s burn some cash to understand money better
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s study together the example that made the distinction between the two very clear to me: let’s say I burn a $20 bill — will any value be destroyed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well… Simply no! What has been destroyed is my ability to claim the aforementioned value: I can’t exchange the ashes of my bill for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-itrain&#34;&gt;Make it rain!
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between a store of value and a claim upon value allows us to also understand &lt;strong&gt;the obsession with circulating currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, money is not wealth by itself: as long as the money is not claimed (spent for goods or services), it has no contribution whatsoever to the wealth of the given country.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our previous cash burning experiment to dig deeper: when I burnt my $20 bill, it had no impact on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the USA. Yet, if I start to burn millions of dollars, we might start to see &lt;strong&gt;secondary consequences&lt;/strong&gt; affecting the GDP: since there will be less money circulating, there might be less people using it to claim value (a beer, clothes…) and therefore an impact on the real economy of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those secondary consequences will &lt;strong&gt;only happen if the cash I burnt was meant to be spent&lt;/strong&gt; — if burning the bills prevented me from claiming the value they carried. Hence, if I’m a multi billionaire (so let’s assume: incapable of spending all of my money), I can burn millions of dollar without having any impact on the economy: those millions would have never flowed back into the economy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting a stop to the flow of money which would have changed hands without that stop is like preventing others to work to provide value; this value would have been exchanged for currency if the money was circulating freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;counterfeit-money-realvalue&#34;&gt;Counterfeit money, real value?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get over with the myth of money as a store of value, let’s consider a third and last scenario. Let’s say I print a very **well done stash of counterfeit money **— everybody take it for the real one. Now I give out those bills to normal American citizens, and for the sake of the simplicity of this example, the FED doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/print.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that scenario, the happy citizens who got free real-like yet counterfeit bills will start spending them for goods and services — they will claim what is rightfully theirs because of their ownership of the bills, hence increasing the GDP of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, all of this is a scam, no value was actually created: I only printed and handed out fake bills that people think legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money barely is the key to the gold chest. When money itself, its physical medium, still had value (such as gold or silver coins), the content of the chest was still tied to the amount written on the key. Now, we are in a system where keys are changing endlessly changing hands without ever returning to open the chest. &lt;strong&gt;Our trust in our currencies is so high that the amount written on the key is sufficient and even authoritative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bartering-and-its-inefficiency&#34;&gt;The myth of bartering and its inefficiency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the first tale about the origin of money presented in the beginning of this article: was bartering really as prevalent as the story make it seems?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place some context to answer this question. We’re talking about a world where money doesn’t exist yet; hell, the very notion of “property” is even clear yet. &lt;strong&gt;Of course there were exchanges, but the “exchange protocol” was very different that what we picture behind the idea of bartering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/swap.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premodern agricultural societies were largely self-sufficient: exchanges between the member of a given community followed informal systems based on relationships: the “economy” was powered by gifting and reciprocity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, rather than the &lt;code&gt;my goat for your corn&lt;/code&gt; kind of deal, it was more like &lt;code&gt;I will help you build this house because I know how to do it. Later on, you&#39;ll help me furnish this other house since you&#39;re a skilled woodworker. If you don&#39;t, it can put an end to 1/our relationship, 2/your very place in the community&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Considering the system depicted above was informal, the “if you don’t…” part didn’t need to be stated, it was understood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the premodern agricultural societies depicted above, barter also existed but wasn’t the main mean of exchange: it was useful to be able to exchange with people who didn’t share the kind of relationship we depicted — for exchanges between communities for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-distortion-of-the-historians-lens&#34;&gt;The distortion of the Historian’s lens
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be another reason to explain why the tale of the evolution from bartering to currency is still prevalent. &lt;strong&gt;To reconstruct the past, historians use remains found in modern times&lt;/strong&gt;. Coins stand the test of time. On the opposite, informal gift/counter-gift dynamics barely leave any traces behind them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;The Origin of Ancient Helixism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the example frequently chosen to illustrate the bartering system are doubtful. We’re talking about &lt;code&gt;goat vs corn&lt;/code&gt; deals, but is it realistic in the context of a premodern agricultural society? Since they were mostly auto sufficient, bartering was for goods that weren&amp;rsquo;t required for the community&amp;rsquo;s survival, since these were already produced within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;downplaying-the-role-ofbanks&#34;&gt;DOWNPLAYING THE ROLE OF BANKS
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tale of the origins of money, banks look like mere intermediary. They provide more or less practical systems allowing the money to flow: it used to be ledgers, and it’s still is but now we have a clunky web interface to write/edit stuff in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this skip &lt;strong&gt;the crucial role played by banks in our current monetary systems: monetary creation&lt;/strong&gt;. For the sake of the easy-of-comprehension of this article, I won’t dive into the depths of it in here, a quick presentation of it will have to suffice. This mechanism is called the fractional-reserve banking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;fractional-reserve&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short and (too) quick explanation — a central bank emit a monetary base allowing commercial banks to issue currency by themselves through loans. When Bob comes to Bank of America for a $10,000 loan, BA is not pulling money from its reserve to credit Bob’s account. No, what happens instead is this: the amount written in Bank of America’s ledger next to Bob’s name is increased by 10,000, and that’s pretty much it. The confidence is the banking system is preserved through mandatory reserve, corresponding to a fraction (~10%) of the loaned amount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Which leads us to our next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-myth-of-bits-a-digital-ledger-is-still-a-good-oldledger&#34;&gt;The myth of bits: a digital ledger is still a good old ledger
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we are clear on monetary creation — made by bank and nothing more that an input on a ledger — let’s tackle the last myth surrounding money, the one that states that money became 0 and 1, bits stored somewhere on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/1000xcut.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In real life, the nature of money hasn’t changed&lt;/strong&gt;: the good old bank ledger is still authoritative. Its authority comes from the fact that it doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it draws its authority from the whole &lt;strong&gt;political, societal and judiciary system that surround it&lt;/strong&gt;. The way we interact with the ledger (analog or digital) doesn’t reshuffle the decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With credit cards, ATMs, online banking and all the others “innovations”, it might seem like our monetary system evolved. In reality, we’re still very close to our first monetary systems and our modern currencies follow pretty much the same rules as the old ones. &lt;strong&gt;Innovations and changes happened mostly at the interface level: how we interact with the ledger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/money101/coins.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes happened at the monetary creation level, it used to be much simpler and a state matter but the rest didn’t budge much. Our modern currencies share more with the Gold Franc&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - pardon my Frenchness - that we imagine. Disruption has yet to happen on currencies, what we had so far is barely a parade of facelifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-sneak-peak-into-the-real-monetary-innovations&#34;&gt;A sneak peak into the real monetary innovations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We needed to lay out the groundwork in order to finally reach this point, the most interesting part: how does real monetary innovation looks like? The answer is not as simple as “Bitcoin”, it can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-the-ledgers-governance-mechanism&#34;&gt;Change the ledgers’ governance mechanism
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: the current trust placed in our ledgers is due to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reputation of the institutions who handle the monetary systems, be it central banks, private banks or other institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The political, legal and societal framework built around banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general public ignorance of the mechanisms governing currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s not much to hold the whole monetary system afloat; don’t worry, you’re not the only one. Critics have been numerous and early; in the 80s the cypherpunk movement were already looking into alternative currencies to break free from the fiat ones.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiat currencies are intrinsically useless objects that serves a medium of exchanges. They only have value because a government maintain and guarantee it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cypherpunk experimented with digital currencies and eventually lead us to the Bitcoin introduced by Satoshi. With Bitcoin, &lt;strong&gt;the trust in the monetary institutions is no longer required&lt;/strong&gt; (“trustless”). Indeed, in short the idea is as follows: instead of trusting the banks and other institutions to maintain the ledger, why not make that ledger public (=blockchain) and rely on our peers instead? This system also requires the use of cryptography and mechanisms to reach a consensus on the public ledger (so there is only one), but that will be covered in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alter-the-innate-propriety-ofmoney&#34;&gt;Alter the innate propriety of money
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about a currency that depreciates if not used? It would help to keep it circulating. The idea is not new, it was theorised in 1916 already by Silvio Gesell and is called demurrage.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a currency depreciating over time might seem scary at first as it contradict our intuitive comprehension of money (“&lt;em&gt;how can it be a store of value if its value shrink over time?”&lt;/em&gt;). We already have already established that this intuitive comprehension of money was far from the truth of the practical world. This kind of money has an evident interest for recessionary phases, as it promotes spending the money quickly and “punishes” hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;limit-what-kind-of-items-money-can-claim-be-claimedupon&#34;&gt;Limit what kind of items money can claim be claimed upon
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without even altering the innate proprieties of money, we can change what it can be exchanged for. Local currencies are a good example of this. If they are designed carefully, this kind of currencies can help revitalize the local economy and independent businesses. Local currencies are plentiful; the Brixton Pound (B£) is one of the most well known. The team behinds it does a pretty good job to explain their thought process.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this article will provide you with a better understanding of money but most importantly that it sparked an interest and it makes you want to learn more about it! The actual monetary innovation has yet to happen. The good news is &lt;strong&gt;now that we have cryptocurrencies, it’s much easier to create new ones&lt;/strong&gt; — pretty much anybody can do it and it’s an excellent news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that all the mechanisms we talked about and many more will be implemented and tested at scale. They already are: there are more than 1500 traded cryptocurrencies and easily another 10 thousands local, confidential or developed for learning purposes. You would like to mint your own coins too?

&lt;p&gt;Beyond what blockchain can offer, maybe here lies the most valuable contribution of Satoshi. &lt;strong&gt;By creating Bitcoin, he paved the way and reminded the whole world that minting money isn’t reserved to states&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s the business of regular people too: you, me, us, and even your computer illiterate grandma should have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all changes, it sounds scary but if you think twice about it, it makes so much sense: &lt;strong&gt;who better than the future users themselves could design the currency the most fitted to their needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 11:54:20 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-nation-as-a-service-and-its-fractional-citizenship-a-good-idea/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/naas/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Nation as a Service and its fractional citizenship- a good idea?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nationalists movements seem to be thriving, an equally interesting counter trend is shaping itself quietly. Despite nationalists’ wish to provide the services of the nation only to the purest of their kind, others countries are turning to the opposite direction: they are starting to provide services to non-citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia is one of the pioneers reshaping role of the nation and what being a “citizen” even means. Since the launch of the e-residency program, close than 30 000 world citizens applied. Yet e-Estonia is only beginning: the country is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/happy-3rd-birthday-to-our-global-e-resident-community-7143adc73994&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;aiming to reach 10 millions e-resident by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, for a country counting 1.35 million “physical” citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explore what a Nation as a Service entails, you’ll remark that all of its features already existing in regular nations. The NaaS simply take it so much farther than the nation itself become something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birth-of-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;The Birth of the Nation as a Service
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first introduced the concept in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/&#34; &gt;a very raw article&lt;/a&gt; that went from my head to Medium in 90 minutes. It started with a tale to introduce the concept that scared some readers and hurt the political sensibility of others. While passion could be nice, I wanted to offer a more formal take on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first introduced the concept, I depicted the “4 cornerstones of the Nation as a Service” as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of nation state, as we use to know it, becomes obsolete. Regular nations are decomposing or powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the void, “digital nations” emerge. They might be tied to real nations (like Estonia), entirely virtual, or even raise money (ICO?) to purchase a land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These digital nations will offer the same services offered by our current nations, on a narrower scope: they will focus mostly on business regulations. Then, the most advanced ones might expand their scope: finance, currency, healthcare, education…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, citizens won’t be tied to a nation by birth anymore. Citizens will compare the offers from different nations and choose their fit. They might have to pay for the service (Estionian e-residency is 100€ one time cost). Nations will compete with one another to attract citizens, and extreme concentration is possible (winner-takes-all market): there are no limits anymore to contain the amount of citizens a nation can have. We’ll observe the birth of “Citizenship portability” — changing nationality will be easier than changing of internet service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still stand by them, but allow me to dive deeper today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-formal-definition-of-the-nation-as-a-servicenaas&#34;&gt;A formal definition of the Nation as a Service (NaaS)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go straight to the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nation as a Service (NaaS) provides a digital fractional citizenship under a subscription model.&lt;/strong&gt; The definition might be short but it’s quite dense, let’s unfold it methodically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-is-digital-native&#34;&gt;The NaaS is digital-native
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of NaaS emerged over the last few years. The first full-fledged NaaS is e-Estonia which opened up its e-residency 3 years ago. Since these new nations were born in a digital world from start, we observe a drastic paradigm shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It translates into the incorporation of digital concepts in the very nature of the state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital first&lt;/strong&gt;: all public services are available online and remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data&lt;/strong&gt;: making public data accessible to all through APIs. This allow for the creation of third-party services for public infrastructure: the easiest example to grasp would be the app that gives the departure time of trains/metros/bus already available in most big cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data portability between public services&lt;/strong&gt;: there is no need to resubmit information to every public service anymore. One submission to the relevant service is enough since the access is shared to other public services that might need it (with the citizens’ consent of course).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts might be hard to envision in practice, so let me take you to Estonia thanks to Kaspar Korjus (the managing director of the e-residency program). He depicts what it means in the real world while he talks about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/what-is-a-nation-children-born-today-will-grow-up-with-a-radically-different-answer-b31f14403c3c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the birth of his son Ruufus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information &lt;/p&gt;
\[The name, sex, date of birth and parents of the children, registered by the doctor at the hospital\]
&lt;p&gt; is really useful straight away because various parts of government would need it to better serve us as new parents, such as by scheduling health checks, supporting with child care and allocating our parental leave allowance. This would generate added hassle for new parents in most countries, but in Estonia the information begins flowing automatically between departments and agencies along our secure, decentralised information network known as the ‘X-road’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that e-Estonia is a digital nation built on top of a regular one. Now imagine what kind of efficiency a digital nation from start could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-offers-fractional-citizenship&#34;&gt;The NaaS offers fractional citizenship
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citizenship offered by a NaaS is not a full-fledged citizenship. So far Estonian e-residents can open up an Estonian bank account and own a business, but they can’t settle in Estonia or vote. The choice was made for practical reasons: it’s much easier to start small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next years, we will see new features added to the service provided by NaaS. Since the idea of single citizenship status for all citizens is already shattered in pieces, the logic will be pushed even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be different tiers of citizens who have access to different services. The most bare bone tier being the only made only of the identity verification protocols while the most advanced one will eventually offer something similar to our current citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-naas-is-available-under-a-subscription-model&#34;&gt;The NaaS is available under a subscription model
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subscription model is the direct consequence of the fractional citizenship. Since the citizenship is now made of different parts citizens can choose to subscribe to or not, we can envision the establishment of a subscription model for the NaaS, with several different options ranging from a pure business citizenship to a full-fledged citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, in e-Estonia it’s a single 100€ fee to submit a candidacy. In the future, it might take the form a yearly/monthly subscription with different features. Here’s what I see, from the most basic to the most advanced one. The first two are already available in the Estonian e-residency in its current form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: provide a digital ID card allowing the holder to prove its identity to public or private services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: provide the ability to open a bank account and set up a business in the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;: allows the benefactor to vote and participate in local (city/region) elections and create NGOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political citizenship:&lt;/strong&gt; allows the benefactor to vote at national elections and other public consultations such as referendums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription to the &lt;strong&gt;national Healthcare service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription to the &lt;strong&gt;national pension plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the &lt;strong&gt;full-fledged citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All these different features will probably be gated behind conditions, such as being an e-citizen for X years, and an additional fee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;citizenship-portability&#34;&gt;Citizenship portability
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another direct consequence of all three characteristic of the NaaS depicted below is the notion of citizenship portability. Since citizenships become subscription based, what used to be an edge case — changing nationality — will become commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more and more fractional citizenships available under a subscription model, “prospects” might start to compare the offers essentially putting citizenships in competition with one another. Some might even stack or mix and match different citizenship offers. E-Nations will have to account for this new trend and provide services to facilitate the switch from one NaaS to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;CONCLUSION
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was written to be nothing more than an analysis giving you a framework to read the current shift happening on the very definition of a nation. I tried my best to avoid any judgement one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I think the ongoing shift I described in this article will have tremendous consequences, many of which are not yet envisioned. I still can’t really figure how to feel about this, I jump from curiosity to anger, or from fascination to despair. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to Crypto Bullshit: How to spot a shitcoin?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to invest in an ICO, or get your hands on some already traded coins? Awesome, welcome aboard! Before you jump in, let me give you some clues to spot shaky projects with examples taken from actual ones. These tips come from my experience (and failures) as well the discussion I had both with friends and the cryptocurrency community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-whitepaper-is-always-the-most-insightful-resource&#34;&gt;The Whitepaper is ALWAYS the most insightful resource
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitepapers (WP for the rest of this article) can be scary. While some manage to keep it short (~10 pages), others can reach the hundreds yet it’s the best place to gauge the seriousness of a project. &lt;strong&gt;It’s still the first thing I check once I’m seriously considering a coin&lt;/strong&gt;. So what should you be watching closely in a WP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-englishlanguage&#34;&gt;The English Language
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising? Not so much if you put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;how to trust an organization unable to put out a flawless WP with a decentralized cryptocurrency project?&lt;/strong&gt; It might seem small or even petty, but if you find a low-quality English or repeated typos in the WP, you better start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;big-promises-with-technical-vagueness&#34;&gt;Big Promises with technical vagueness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common, as most people won’t read the technical parts of the whitepaper. Even if you don’t fully get the technical details, the difference between a WP trying to cover its lies and a transparent one are quite apparent. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sficoin.co/white-paper/white-paper.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SFIcoin is the perfect example of this — DONT INVEST: SCAM&lt;/a&gt;, the full recipe is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big promises that don’t mean anything&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Next Global Paying System”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbacked claims&lt;/strong&gt;: their WP that details the vision, the roadmap, the use cases but doesn’t address AT all the tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, the SFICOIN is just going to be the first leading peer to peer cryptocurrency to manage the high-value instant payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We will be the first to X”&lt;/strong&gt;: massive red flag. There are no certainties in cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A WP made by marketers for marketers&lt;/strong&gt; lot of visuals, a lot of work on design but overall it’s empty of real meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok for a WP to get quite technical (here is Stellar’s — XLM), but it’s not OK to cover an absence of technical solution with jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;stellar-wp&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-darwin-awards-of-whitepapers&#34;&gt;The Darwin Awards of Whitepapers
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how does a terrible WP looks like? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://narbonne.io/Narbonne.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Check Narbonne’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been 7 months and I can’t find any worse. Out of the 22 pages, ~18 are spitting copy pasta about the future. Most of the paper is very generic, and so many things in it are so off. I had to pick one so here we go, the comparison between Narbonne, Ether&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;um and Wa&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;es. Yes, you read it right, they can’t even spell Ethereum and Waves properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things need to be debunked in this table, it’s actually a good exercise. Here are a few you do the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bookkeeping at the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;”: I’m not even sure what it means, but I think a project like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://request.network/#/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Request (REQ)&lt;/a&gt; covers this for Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Mobile Banking”: Hello &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://omisego.network/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OmiseGo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“AI, chatbot, voice control”: strictly no use for the project (an infrastructure for banks) but buzzwords so they had to be here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-does-a-proper-wp-looklike&#34;&gt;How does a proper WP look like?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WP is a &lt;strong&gt;technical document&lt;/strong&gt; usually presenting at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vision for the project / what problem the team is trying to crack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the technical solutions proposed to the problem and why they were chosen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The details of the technical implementation of the chosen solutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credible roadmap for the delivery,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical information about the token: token type, total amount, token mechanisms…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifications for the ICO, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hone your skills, there is nothing better than the OG! I invite you to read the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;original Bitcoin’s whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; written by Satoshi. You can also check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ethereum’s WP&lt;/a&gt; to remind you that &lt;strong&gt;the design doesn’t have to be fancy&lt;/strong&gt; (it’s a GitHub wiki) if the fundamentals are sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardano’s WPs: split between a “&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/philosophy/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;philosophical WP&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cardano.org/en/academic-papers/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;academic papers&lt;/a&gt;, I think the team does an outstanding job to make their project intelligible to those interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transactions-per-secondmyth&#34;&gt;The Transactions per second myth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the whitepapers covered, let me address another big chunk of today’s article: the myth of the transactions per second (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;transaction-per-second-a-convenient-lie&#34;&gt;Transaction per second: A convenient lie
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPS doesn’t mean anything at all.&lt;/strong&gt; So why is it so popular? Well, it’s a bit like the GHz for processors: it used to be the only thing advertised. It makes sense in a way, &lt;strong&gt;it gives the impression&lt;/strong&gt; that you have a standard allowing you to compare different processors that are actually not comparable: higher is always better right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. You can have a 32 bit 1 core processor operating at 3.5 GHz and a 64 bits 8 cores processor operating at 2 GHz. Guess which one delivers the most computing power? It’s the second one without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the same for the tokens, except it’s not only the power that matters here. Let me pull &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-decentralization-matters-a-12-min-overview-for-the-layman-6ec572d35af6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a quick reminder from my previous article if you missed it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the TPS is meaningless, it’s almost expected now. Newcomer investors will put significant trust in this very misleading indicator, and most projects advertise a given TPS. Good! It gives you a good sign of how honest they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-tps-to-cut-through-thecrap&#34;&gt;Using TPS to cut through the crap
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider coin A, advertising 1M TPS and coin B advertising 10 TPS. What about the features they support? What about decentralization? What about the team vision? Community support? Simply by looking at the number, I know now that Coin A is bullshit and coin B could be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/hitchhikerguide/nano.gif&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;nano&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current state of the art of tech allows for a maximum of ~10 000 TPS (already huge) without excessive centralization.&lt;/strong&gt; Any coin promising something higher than this is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making compromise on decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@CryptoPeterG/eos-centralization-problem-bd7a392eeed2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The prime example of this EOS&lt;/a&gt; and its 21 block producers that have tremendous power over the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lab scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: you can see some coins advertising crazy TPS, some will even show a test network supporting their claim. The thing to look for is the setup of the test network: usually, it’s just a few nodes. It’s easy to reach a high TPS on a three nodes &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets harder and harder as the nodes multiply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking on novel and previously untested technological solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nano.org/en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NANO&lt;/a&gt; uses a new kind of ledger called block-lattice and supports up to 7 000 TPS in ideal conditions. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.iota.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt; which uses another radically new solution (the Tangle) currently supports ~800 TPS, but it will scale with user adoption. Those two are the most radical “ledger innovations” there are and the most promising. They are the current state of the art: to me any project advertising TPS over this without an equally radically new technical solution is instantly suspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including &lt;strong&gt;off-chain scaling&lt;/strong&gt; solutions in their computation of TPS, which leads back to point one: excessive centralization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Including new mechanisms such as sharding&lt;/strong&gt; in their computation. Ethereum which has arguably one of the most robust dev community there is, is still 1 to 2 years away from a live implementation of sharding. How could a bunch of newcomers pull this in 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling this number out of their hat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A cryptocurrency development project often starts quite centralized. What matters is that the team have a plan to open up the network progressively. For instance, NEO is quite centralized for now, but now that the infrastructure is sound&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://neo.org/blog/details/4089&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;the team is making moves towards decentralizing more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we conclude, let us dive into the crazy world of ICOs, it’s such a wild west that it deserves another section by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;icos-red-flags-to-lookfor&#34;&gt;ICOs red flags to look for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;huge-discounts-for-earlybirds&#34;&gt;Huge discounts for early birds
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see an ICO offering huge discounts (&amp;gt;30%) on the first phases of the sale that’s usually a recipe for disaster. Indeed, it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the early birds get such a large discount, they have a &lt;strong&gt;strong incentive to dump at ICO price or even a little below&lt;/strong&gt; once the token hit the market: it’s guaranteed free money if they sell fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should the team need such a strong incentive to drive the sale? I see this pattern a lot for &lt;strong&gt;tokens with close to no utility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the two situations above don’t unfold, one is guaranteed: huge discounts push towards a concentration of the tokens in the hand of a few: it attracts whales. Massive discounts are a recipe for &lt;strong&gt;political centralization and governance problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-product-demo-orcode&#34;&gt;No product, demo or code
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big risk with ICOs is that you’re essentially investing on a promise or a vision. Yet some ask for money once they already have a working alpha while some others run straight to the ICO as soon as the WP is ready. The latter is much riskier. If there is an alpha or a demo version available, please do check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a dev, &lt;strong&gt;it’s always insightful to check the GitHub repository of the project.&lt;/strong&gt; GitHub makes it easy to see how active the repository is, even without looking at the code. This method is far from perfect are there are ways to make it look like a repo is active even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-team-doesntmatch&#34;&gt;The team doesn’t match
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are seriously considering investing in an ICO, I urge you to google the most prominent team members. Look at their LinkedIn, their Twitter, their previous companies, etc. If you find inactive profiles, it’s usually a pretty bad sign. You might also find skeletons in the closest, such as one team member who participated in another crypto project that turned out to be a failure or a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Banano, a NANO fork&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low quality or frequency social media presence is also a bright orange flag. These guys will have to market their project, acquire users and partners. If they can’t market themselves, it’s already a shaky start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also very common for ICO scams to advertise a prestigious advisor… that has nothing to do with the project&lt;/strong&gt;. Double check any high profile figure to make sure they are actually involved in the project. If you see Satoshi as advisor, RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;inappropriate-token-distribution&#34;&gt;Inappropriate token distribution
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The token distribution chart is usually present in every WP. If it’s not, it’s essentially like “give us your money, and we won’t tell you what we’ll do with it”… RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually looks like a pie chart. The most transparent projects have two: one for the distribution of the tokens, and one covering how the funds will be spent by team.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Storm token distribution is pretty good (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.stormtoken.com/token-structure-and-ceo-update-bd055860251e&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok, even good that the team reserves a share of the token for the development of the project. You have to watch the share allocated to the team: it can range from 10% to 30% for the reasonable projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme of the spectrum, you have coins like Ripple (XRP) for which the team owns ~60% of the total supply. It is a significant risk for token holders: first, it’s an enormous vector of centralization. Besides, it means that &lt;strong&gt;the team can heavily manipulate the price of its coin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A few months ago, facing a backlash against this very centralized distribution, the team put an escrow system in place using a smart contract.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ripple.com/dev-blog/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;55 billions tokens are now placed in escrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and released at the pace of 1 billion per month. It doesn’t change anything to the underlying centralization issue and makes me wonder which kind of team would need $500 million (current price of XRP ~ $0.5) each month for its development/partnership/other. Besides,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;since these tokens are now locked they are not counted in the circulating supply (~39B)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which might reassure investors but is purely misleading. The actual supply is 100B tokens. Personal view: the whole move feels like a marketing stunt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article to provide you with some clues to help you spot unreliable crypto projects. Overall, I hope that you understand by now that &lt;strong&gt;the more you read before investing, the lower the risk will be&lt;/strong&gt;. I advise you NOT TO INVEST IMPULSIVELY. Even if it’s the best project in the world, you can sleep on it, read some more and decide a couple of days later with a fresh outlook if you want in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, let me give you more tricks I use to get a quick idea of the seriousness of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google search &lt;code&gt;site:reddit.com &amp;quot;token name (+scam/shitcoin/issues...)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;: this method allows you to search Reddit for a specific token. If there is a massive red flag on the project, it&amp;rsquo;s usually documented somewhere on Reddit. &lt;em&gt;Additional note: Reddit is getting quite tribal now. The best place to find reliable information on a given token is certainly not the token subreddit. Don&amp;rsquo;t go to /r/Ripple/ if you want an objective perspective on XRP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t trust one single source, always cross them!&lt;/strong&gt; Greedy people are promoting shaky projects all around the internet, never blindly trust just one guy even if he seems to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several services exist to organize the community due diligence on ICOs. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://icocheck.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ICOCheck&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty reliable one, but do your own due diligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: &lt;strong&gt;I strongly recommend you to not invest in ICOs for at least the first year you’ve been invested in cryptos&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of them fail dramatically. You are much better off limiting yourself to the top 25/100/200 tokens depending on the risk you’re willing to take. Even among those, there are many doubtful projects: beware and happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

A 12 min overview for the layman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the general public is hearing more and more about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and cryptocurrencies, the philosophical and political underlying of decentralization are still kept mostly within the community. &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is bringing a paradigm shift that deserves more coverage than price action in my book&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I realized that I didn’t really understood decentralization. I got the high-level concept, but I failed to connect all the dots and &lt;strong&gt;understand the social and political ramifications of it.&lt;/strong&gt; Since then, I’ve done my homework and now it’s time to give back my humble understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

The Simpsons: Season 16, Episode 19 — Thank God it’s Doomsday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is not an easy change to apprehend. Imagine yourself in the internet early days, let’s say 1995. Could you have thought about all the potential use cases for this new tech and how they were going to unfold? Back then, you even had prominent actors from the tech industry &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;predicting the uselessness or failure of the internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Metcalfe, in InfoWorld, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waring Partridge, in Wired, 1995:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to laugh at them now, but ask yourself this question: Aren’t you doing exactly the same thing with decentralized services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first audience for this article are people who read two articles from mainstream medias before concluding that decentralization is stupid. &lt;strong&gt;Let me be the third and the charm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medias are here to promote emotional content that makes you react, so you get your dopamine shot and come back. They are not here to help you learn and grow. They caused their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one am simply a 26 years old French dude with a knack for writing and time on his hand. &lt;strong&gt;I have nothing to sell to you, but simply one goal: help people to realize what’s happening, so they can be part of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested the draft on people aged anything from 20y old to 60+. &lt;strong&gt;It’s foolproof, as long as your willing to lend me 12 minutes of your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll gain a framework allowing you to see decentralization for what it is: the premise of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is hard, scary and confusing. It destroys your previous references and leaves you in a world where you have to re-think everything again. It’s a lot of work to adapt, but the earlier your start, the easiest it is, just like it happened for Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share this piece with your decentralization-sceptic and decentralization-enthusiast friends alike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization-is-multidimensional-spectrum&#34;&gt;Decentralization is multidimensional spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious to some, but it’s an important fact: &lt;strong&gt;Decentralization is a spectrum, not a state&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes from the most centralized systems possible, such as our current fiat monetary systems (&lt;strong&gt;“Central”&lt;/strong&gt; Banks decide pretty much everything) to the most decentralized systems, such as the English language (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here is an interesting infographic giving you an overview of the centralization of major industries:&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Lillian Wei, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-governance-how-decentralized-do-we-need-to-be-799a7988ce84&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you get the spectrum of decentralization, the second thing to understand is the &lt;strong&gt;different dimensions of decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is than in absolute, they aren’t any typology of the different dimensions of decentralization. To make things easier, I’m gonna use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgStgMyR9sY&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the one proposed by Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder of Ethereum, one of the leading decentralization projects) that features three main dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-architectural-dimension&#34;&gt;1. The Architectural Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This dimension is easy to grasp because about the physical things&lt;/strong&gt;: the devices, the servers, the stuff! The architectural dimension address &lt;strong&gt;the base units of the network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize architectural decentralization, you’ll need to multiply the devices powering your &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/network&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;network&lt;/a&gt;, and spread them around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Visualizer: Tangle.glumb.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know how architecturally decentralized a system is, you can ask these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many underlying devices are powering the network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they geographically spread or concentrated in one area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-political-dimension&#34;&gt;2. The Political Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics is about power. This dimension address the &lt;strong&gt;decision making process of the system&lt;/strong&gt;. The most politically centralized protocol is one where a sole decision maker makes all the shots. At the other end of the spectrum, you’ll have many actors and evenly distributed responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2018/decentralisation-layman/politics.jpeg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most politically decentralized systems, the spread between the least influential node and the most influential node is kept to a minimum. The perfectly politically decentralized network would offer the same influence to any node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good questions to determine how politically decentralized a system is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people/groups are involved in the decision making process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the power repartition looks like? What kind of criteria is used to weight each participant influence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they any recourse / appeal mechanisms built in the system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-the-logical-dimension&#34;&gt;3. The Logical Dimension
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logical dimension is by far the hardest of the three to understand. Don’t give up if you don’t get it from the first read! In Vitalik’s terms, it reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your system look like one thing single thing like a singleton or does it look more like an amorphous swarm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this dimension is about the differences between each nodes that compose the network. To maximize logical decentralization, you want them to diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let some fancy words scare you, it’s actually not so hard. Looking at examples really helped me understand this one, so here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A direct democracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture of a direct democracy is quite centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: there are a few places (parliament, chambers, police, military…) that are the nodes of the protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the architectural centralization, the decision power is spread in a direct democracy so &lt;strong&gt;the protocol is politically decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt; — aka it’s one main “body”. There is only one government enforcing one set of laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nation vs Federation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are architecturally centralized,&lt;/strong&gt; for the same reason than the direct democracy: there are only a few locations/institutions where the action happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both are also politically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: the president/assembly/other elected or not officials hold most of the power, without any public oversight. You can’t swap president two years in, you have to wait the full term, even if the president lie, collude with foreign powers, mishandle public money… Hi to the elephant in the room! The federation might be a little less politically centralized than the nation, but it’s quite similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logical dimension is where things get interesting. While &lt;strong&gt;a nation is one unique main “body”, aka logically centralized&lt;/strong&gt;, a federation is made of distinct “parts” that acknowledge and preserve their difference while working towards a common goal. Hence the federation is a good example of logically decentralized system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The English Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The architecture is very decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the English language as a protocol, a node would be any English speaking person. The good news is they are plenty, they are diverse, and spread all around the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The political dimension of it is also quite decentralized.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no single governing body deciding what English is and is not. Yes, there are official institutions publishing English Grammars for instance, but the grammar is not law: you can choose to follow it or not. The actual English, the one linguists study, is not the one depicted in a grammar, it’s the one spoken by all English speaking individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;it’s also very logically decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;. Two English speakers coming from different countries might speak an English that is very different from one another, because of the vocabulary, the emphasis, or even the sentence structure. You have many different kind of English spoken all around the globe: American English, UK English, my beloved Frenglish…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-three-dimensional-decentralization-spectrum&#34;&gt;Using the three dimensional decentralization spectrum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each dimension is mostly independent from one another. &lt;strong&gt;You can have a service at one end of the spectrum for one dimension, and the other end on another&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-study-web-hostingservices&#34;&gt;Case Study: Web Hosting Services
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web hosting services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) are the perfect example of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From an architectural perspective, they want their network to be as decentralized as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. As a hosting provider, AWS need to be reliable. To do so, they have many servers so that the redundancy builds resilience. Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;both for performance and security reasons, they have their servers spread all around the world&lt;/strong&gt;. It reduces latency and further increase resilience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Overview of the main AWS datacenters location. Source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, from a political perspective, Amazon has absolute control over the network. They can refuse to serve you, delete your content (if it’s illegal for instance) and the AWS user community no say on their decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Hence, on the political dimension, AWS is close the most centralized end of the spectrum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, on the logical dimension AWS is centralized, it’s a pretty monolithic company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-significant-hassle-than-can-be-worth-thetrouble&#34;&gt;A significant hassle than can be worth the trouble
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re clear on the decentralization spectrum, you might wonder why going through the hassle? Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;decentralized systems tend to be more complex and harder to manage that centralized ones&lt;/strong&gt;: they have many different components, a decision power spread between several parties and an accountability imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-decentralized-systems-efficient-for-computations&#34;&gt;Are decentralized systems efficient for computations?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those requirements weight on the system and slow it down, right? So why go through the hassle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it’s even more than that! It can be hard to find a relevant comparison between centralized and decentralized systems, but the price of computing power is probably the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, the ratio between the cost of the computing power on the Ethereum Word Computer vs a traditional one (ex Amazon EC2) is between roughly one million&lt;/strong&gt;. Scary ratio, right? (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xHiI-G_CQ&amp;amp;t=251s&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Don’t trust me, go here to check&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… yes and no. First, you have to consider how cheap computing power got over the last couple decades. We’re reaching a point where even just $1 spent on AWS represents a tremendous amount of computing power. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; presents the evolution of computing over the last 25 years with neat infographics:&lt;/p&gt;

Hard Disks dramatically increased in capacity while becoming more compact. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-trillion-fold-increase-computing-power/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well, we’ve got to ask ourselves: does the comparison even makes sense? It can be useful to understand the current state of our tech, but does it tell us anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The choice to make a system more decentralized isn’t made for performance; it’s made for the advantages provided by decentralization&lt;/strong&gt;. It allows creating new kind of services offering guarantees that weren’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralizations-benefits-the-edge-of-thecrowd&#34;&gt;Decentralization’s benefits: The Edge of the Crowd
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, decentralized systems offer a set of unique advantages opening a wide range of use cases. Let’s go through the main advantages one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;efficiency&#34;&gt;EFFICIENCY
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some cases, making a system decentralized is simply the best way to answer your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the physical distribution of post offices is decentralized. It wouldn’t be efficient to have all the post offices in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion that can play a large role for the efficiency of a system: &lt;strong&gt;spare capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider people who already own a resource (let’s say a house or car), but only use it 10% of the time. Instead of having to build a whole new infrastructure for your service, you can use instead the spare capacity that is already available: hello Uber or Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fault-tolerance&#34;&gt;FAULT TOLERANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a decentralized system is redundant (there are no elements that exist only once, all have many “copies”), &lt;strong&gt;the risk of the whole system failing accidentally is much more limited than a centralized system.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s precisely why web hosting services have to be architecturally decentralized. But many systems benefit from fault tolerance: consider the energy production/distribution network for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another notion quite useful to understand why decentralized system are resilient, it’s the &lt;strong&gt;SPOF. Single Point of Failure&lt;/strong&gt; is a term used in network infrastructure to describe an element than is not redundant: it exists only once. &lt;strong&gt;If this element was to fail, it would bring the whole system down, hence the name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still following, you should be able to connect the dots: since everything is redundant in a an architecturally decentralized system, there are no SPOF. If there is a SPOF, it means that there is a single/central element somewhere (that could break), hence it’s not a decentralized system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;attack-resistance&#34;&gt;ATTACK RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attack resistance is essentially a matter of cost/benefit. &lt;strong&gt;Unattackable systems don’t exist, what do exist are systems that are simply to costly to attack considering the potential reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider malicious actors that would be looking to damage the protocol not for direct financial benefit, but for something else. Maybe it’s a competitor trying to bring you down? Even in that scenario, the attacker would need to dedicate a lot of resource to have a chance to bring a decentralized system down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact to consider is also that information is spread over many devices. &lt;strong&gt;If an attacker manage to get control over one device, he only gets access to a fragment of the whole dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; It makes the system more resilient to hacks, as the data is less exposed. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.fr/search?q=ashley&amp;#43;madison&amp;#43;hack&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR792FR792&amp;amp;oq=ASHLEY&amp;#43;MADISON&amp;#43;HACK&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3446j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Too bad Ashley Madison wasn’t architecturally decentralized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;collusion-resistance&#34;&gt;COLLUSION RESISTANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind collusion resistance is to make it hard for one subgroup of the system to come together and act only for their own best interest, to the detriment of the whole system. The extreme example of collusion would be a monopoly — it lets actor gain an unfair advantage over the whole market and impose its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instance, in our modern democracies, collusion resistance is extremely low&lt;/strong&gt;: the common interest of the system (the betterment of the country) is frequently, some would even say systematically hijacked by specific subgroups (such as businesses) for their own benefits (profits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is a high level concept that is essential to understand blockchain and other decentralized ledgers. If you want to explore further, you can look at videos of founders of the major project explaining their vision to get a better idea of what a decentralized system enable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have missed the internet revolution, but you’re in luck for this one: it’s barely beginning! &lt;strong&gt;Now is the time to get knowledgeable about it so you can recognize and harness opportunities as they emerge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article helped you get a better understanding of the paradigm shift offered by the newfound ability to develop decentralized protocols at scale, thanks to blockchain. and other decentralized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Demise of Nation States: Introducing the Nation as a Service (NaaS)</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2018 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-demise-of-nation-states-introducing-the-nation-as-a-service-naas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/demise-ns/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Demise of Nation States: Introducing the Nation as a Service (NaaS)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you believe or not in the idea of “the march of history”, there is an undeniable worldwide trend that is leading to a complete overall of the power structure: &lt;strong&gt;the progressive disengagement of the state from state affairs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this idea is slowly creeping into the public head space, what’s less discussed is what’s next? What happens once the decomposition is over and there is nothing left? That’s precisely what I’ll address today. I will also suggest a framework to consider the role of the state/nation in a post nation-state world: &lt;strong&gt;the Nation as a Service (NaaS)&lt;/strong&gt;. Before we dive in, let us agree on what “decomposition of the nation state” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-long-and-methodical-process&#34;&gt;A LONG AND METHODICAL PROCESS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to determine when the methodical deconstruction of the state started. Like all societal trends, there is no set starting date and each country/region follows it at its own pace. Only one thing is certain: no state can escape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the chronology of the decomposition of a nation state so we might be able to pinpoint the start of the process more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: What follows is merely a tale written to make you question the (shrinking) role of states.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might hurt your political sensibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Feel free to jump straight to the second part of the article — Introducing the Nation as a Service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-break-down-a-nation-state-a-step-by-steptutorial&#34;&gt;How to break down a nation-state? A step by step tutorial
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s go to a fantasy world that will get truer than reality as we depict it&lt;/strong&gt;. After a long a happy reign as king of BBLand (catchy name eh?), I’ve decided I’m done with it. It’s too much of a hassle, I’ve made enough money. How can I let it go? I can’t just shut off the “business”, I still have millions of citizens on my land. I’ll have to go slow. But I’m in luck, I’ve seen the process happening all around me, I just have to replicate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-i-must-destroy-or-sabotage-the-flows-of-information&#34;&gt;First, I must destroy or sabotage the flows of information
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it does flow, people will know what’s happening and might revolt, I can’t chance it. I’ve got many ways to do this, but I think the most efficient is simply &lt;strong&gt;to allow an unprecedented level of concentration in the medias.&lt;/strong&gt; Eventually, I’ll have less than 10 individuals or companies owning them all, and those happy few will promote exactly the same worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my citizens are left with partisan medias. Even better, those medias so concentrated they are easier to manipulate than ever before. &lt;strong&gt;Essentially, what I did is privatizing the attention of my citizens&lt;/strong&gt; — I’m a very modern ruler you see. Just to make sure there are no reliable information anymore, I’ll also make the advertising laws very lax, let lies and false information spread widely, and turn the political life into a TV show. Now we’re talking and by that I mean we’re not anymore, but that was precisely the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;then-i-must-get-rid-of-all-public-institutions&#34;&gt;Then, I must get rid of all public institutions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I can’t do it overnight, I would risk an uprising. I’m gonna &lt;strong&gt;do it insidiously&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with something remote and easy — the prisons. Prisoners have no rights anyway, right? Even if they do, nobody’s gonna check, they’re hidden from the rest of society! It’s the perfect population to get started: low risk, high reward. So let’s privatize, the market will deal with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now I need a hack for the schools, health care, transportation systems and other critical infrastructure. Let’s cut spending. And cut some more. And some more. By the way, have you seen how inefficient the schools and hospitals have become? Shouldn’t we privatize them to make them efficient again? Excuse me?! I’m hearing a no? Cut! Cut! Cut! Is that a yes? See? When you think twice about it you finally see the light, good citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Yes I’m a Frenchie and I am sincerely sorry for the citizens of the states that never knew what a public healthcare service was. You’re simply moving faster than us! Hurray, “progress”!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;now-i-leave-everything-to-themarkets&#34;&gt;Now, I leave everything to the markets
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I finally managed to get rid of public institutions, I want to finish the process, &lt;em&gt;optimize the efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of my country even more. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be some stuff we haven’t thought of selling yet? What about the forests? They can make money! And the beaches? People should pay for them! I’m seeing a free park? Are you out of your mind? Oh! We forgot to privatize the water distribution network? But all my citizens are users, that’s a potential goldmine! Let’s organize a tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and what about our work laws? Citizens are still thinking they entitled to stuff like “unemployment”. I even had a madman the other day who wanted to prosecute a big corporation for not being socially and ecologically responsible — what a lunatic! I’m gonna slash the work laws a dozen times, just to remind them &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tripalium&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;what “work” used to mean: torture&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t even have to go this far, slavery will be enough. But don’t call it like this, no; remember: I’m a progressive ruler. I’m gonna leave them the freedom of choice: would you rather bike for UberEats or Deliveroo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a rest and contemplate: I have markets everywhere, docile citizens with close to no job security and I’m finishing up on the demolition of the last public institutions. I’m getting there, but I feel like I’m missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;finally-from-people-togoods&#34;&gt;Finally, from people to goods
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have a job? Don’t you know that unemployed people are parasites? They bring down the whole society! What am I hearing? You can’t find a job? Oh my dear, you need to learn how to market yourself, develop your personal brand. How else do you expect to be visible in such a competitive job market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, that’s very regrettable. It makes me angry too. Sadly I can’t do anything about it: it’s the market. If I start to promote progressive laws the jobs will go away. Our neighbor CCLand is taxing companies even less than us; we’ll bleed jobs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-when-did-the-deconstruction-of-the-statestart&#34;&gt;So when did the deconstruction of the state start?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure our little trip to BBLand reminded you a thing or two about the real world. But in reality, all four processes are almost concomitant. Only the first one — the decomposition of the medias — seems to be a prerequisite of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more surprising is how this process started to unfold roughly at the same time in the most developed countries: in the mid 70s. That could be a good starting date. But, I’m not here to talk about media concentration, it’s merely an argument to support my thesis. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.osce.org/fom/13870?download=true&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This topic is already covered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;INTRODUCING THE NATION AS A SERVICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to BBland for a minute, what’s left of our state? Barely the minimal business regulatory infrastructure: companies can’t police themselves. Is there anything alike already in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-e-estonia&#34;&gt;Welcome to e-Estonia!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard about the Estonian e-residency before, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;go have a look&lt;/a&gt; you’ll learn a lot. I know most of my dear readers won’t so here is a screenshot from the official website linked above:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Estonian e-residency official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that there are two essential features offered by the e-residency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A government issued global digital ID available to anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not a citizenship, but you’re still &lt;strong&gt;enough of a citizen to own and operate an Estonian-based business&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;strong&gt;close to 30 000&lt;/strong&gt; “digital nomads”  and other entrepreneurs became e-Estonian residents. Yet the e-residency is just a first step. I wanted to learn more about this intriguing and unique e-country, so I went straight to the source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kaspar.korjus?source=post_header_lockup&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Kaspar Korjus, managing director at E-Residency&lt;/a&gt;. Do read any of his article, it gives you an incredible insight on what’s happening. What follows is simply three insightful quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Estionia’s vision for its e-residency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia’s e-Residency programme is also a fast growing startup — albeit a government startup — &lt;/p&gt;
\[…\]
&lt;p&gt;, often with &lt;strong&gt;best practices that we’ve taken straight from the private sector&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-could-offer-estcoins-to-e-residents-a3a5a5d3c894&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Estonia’s potential cryptocurrency, estcoin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Estonia’s perspective, estcoins &lt;/p&gt;
\[Estionia’s cryptocurrency project\]
&lt;p&gt; were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation from more people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/happy-3rd-birthday-to-our-global-e-resident-community-7143adc73994&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;return on investment for the e-residency&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte published an independent analysis, which revealed that every euro invested in e-Residency by Estonian taxpayers is projected to return 100 euros to the Estonian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-the-nation-as-aservice&#34;&gt;DEFINING THE NATION AS A SERVICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estionia is the perfect transition. When I hit publish, I might be coining the term “Nation as a Service”. But in reality, &lt;strong&gt;Estonia pioneered the concept, I simply gave it a name&lt;/strong&gt;. Kaspar pretty much defined it when he envisioned &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/what-is-a-nation-children-born-today-will-grow-up-with-a-radically-different-answer-b31f14403c3c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the future world of his three years old son Ruufus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps governments don’t have to ‘tax’ Ruufus by then anyway. **Governments can instead earn their main source of income by selling their services globally in the form of monthly subscriptions **— much like how Netflix currently delivers its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he wasn’t looking at it from my angle, allow me to put words on what I see behind this concept. Here are the four cornerstones of the Nation as a Service (NaaS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of nation state, as we use to know it, becomes obsolete. Regular nations are decomposing or powerless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the void, “digital nations” emerge. They might be tied to real nations (like Estonia), entirely virtual, or even raise money (ICO?) to purchase a land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These digital nations will offer the same services offered by our current nations, on a narrower scope: they will focus mostly on business regulations. Then, the most advanced ones might expand their scope: finance, currency, healthcare, education…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, citizens won’t be tied to a nation by birth anymore. Citizens will compare the offers from different nations and choose their fit. They might have to pay for the service (Estionian e-residency is 100€ one time cost). Nations will compete with one another to attract citizens, and extreme concentration is possible (winner-take-all market). We’ll observe the birth of **“Citizenship portability” **— changing nationality will be easier than changing your internet service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply a proposal, let me know what your think about the concept of Nation as a Service, and feel free to redefine it. Is this a disparition of the state, or just a transition to a new type of state? Probably a little bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here? Since Estonia is the most startupy of all the startup-nations, the development of the NaaS is viewed there with a very positive outlook. And indeed why not? So far it seems to have brought wealth and innovation to Estonia. I am the only one to wonder:  is this wealth really created, or simply taken from other countries’ taxes? We’ll know soon enough: &lt;strong&gt;the rat race has already started&lt;/strong&gt;— &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://ereforms.org/news/estonian_press_wrote_on_unbelievable_azerbaijan-246&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Azerbaijan just joined the party&lt;/a&gt; with its m-residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;final-notes&#34;&gt;Final notes
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;My faithful readers know my strong interest for cryptocurrencies and decentralization, I kept myself in check all along the article so allow me to drift of a little bit now. I see many synergies between the NaaS concept and the blockchain: identity verification, taxes, contracts… Yet despite the synergies, a NaaS is a very centralized institution. I’m puzzled. Could one really help the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I give you your attention back (I privatized it a while ago, it’s mine now, remember?), help me to answer this question: Should I cut the crap and start an ICO to raise capital for the first fully private NaaS? I could be the rattiest rat!&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/growing-beyond-the-advertising-model-to-achieve-democracys-true-potential/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:15:12 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/growing-beyond-the-advertising-model-to-achieve-democracys-true-potential/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/ad-model/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Growing beyond the advertising model to achieve democracy’s true potential" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services-3f5724e80baf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we raised many issues about the advertising model and free online services in general. &lt;strong&gt;They all fall within the spectrum of hidden cost, something society, we, eventually pay for.&lt;/strong&gt; From recurring annoyances to a loss of political power, the range of consequences of data concentration for political and social influence is wide. &lt;strong&gt;Behind all of these “free” offers, compromises are made&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many issues with the ad model, all falling under the spectrum of hidden cost. Indeed, behind FB’s “free” offer, a lot of compromises are made, here is a quick overview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advertisement-overload&#34;&gt;ADVERTISEMENT OVERLOAD
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the online services business model, the (infinite) multiplication of ads inevitable. Indeed, it’s the main way for the actor to maximize their revenues. &lt;strong&gt;They are essentially caught in a profitable and vicious circle&lt;/strong&gt;: More ads -&amp;gt; More views, more views -&amp;gt; more sales, more sales -&amp;gt; more money -&amp;gt; more ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ads are profitable, more and more media space is used to that end. New forms of advertising-content hybrids appeared over the past years, like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://techscience.org/a/2015121503/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Native Advertising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;as advertisers are looking for new territory to conquer where the consumer resistance is lower.&lt;/strong&gt; The frontier between a media outlet and a brand outlet is progressively fading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the online side of the industry, the sheer size of the actor should be a cause for concern. &lt;strong&gt;Facebook now as 2bn+ users. That’s more than any government, even China or India can’t compete&lt;/strong&gt;. With this level of mainstream adoption, the reach is virtually unlimited and nobody is out of scope. &lt;strong&gt;To continue to personalize its ads further, Facebook amasses detailed profiles for most individuals, that can then be used to influence them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is the most influential medium for political and social causes. Concentrating so much power in one space is obviously dangerous, as it makes the social discourse more prone to manipulation and coercion. Yet &lt;strong&gt;data is meant to be shared&lt;/strong&gt;, and advertisers are quite generous when it comes to user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;collected-data-areleaking&#34;&gt;COLLECTED DATA ARE LEAKING
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the frequent exchanges between actors in the industry make the data issue widespread and hardly revocable. Whatever the collect point is, the data gathered will eventually be sold to “independent measurement and data company” like Nielsen or Axciom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consumer not only lose control over its data, he also has no knowledge of the usage made of it and who currently owns it&lt;/strong&gt;. Given enough money and resources, anyone could potentially acquire a very detailed file on anybody, including relatives of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profile is often &lt;strong&gt;qualitative enough to let the advertisers and their clients influence opinions, behaviors and ultimately votes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-in-the-state-of-surveillance&#34;&gt;WELCOME IN THE STATE OF SURVEILLANCE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data is not only used for business purposes. Since the beginning of the war on terror, &lt;strong&gt;many western governments got rid of railings limiting the actions of intelligence agencies and surveillance services&lt;/strong&gt;. As monitoring of online services become commonplaces, the novelty now rely on using the data for live facial recognition on surveillance video camera streams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/toolbox&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;toolbox&lt;/a&gt; for crowd and individual control is here. &lt;strong&gt;Even if we ignore what the data gathered allow advertisers and governments to do, this simple act of collection is deeply problematic.&lt;/strong&gt; As the society gain knowledge over this practice, our behavior “normalize”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple awareness of knowing oneself observed will push individuals to modify their behavior in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140209-being-watched-why-thats-good&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;People under scrutiny change their behavior and their choice without even realizing.&lt;/a&gt; Because we know we’re watched, we monitor and censor our own behavior. It doesn’t even have to be a conscious process; we’ll simply tend to match the ideals of the watcher — this is called the observer effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is present in every academic discipline, sometimes with a different name (Hawthorne Effect).&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;panopticon&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation was used by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;philosopher Jeremy Bentham&lt;/a&gt; to envision an institutional building designed for maximum efficiency, the panopticon. Since the watchtower is placed in the center, with prisoners all around, any prisoner can potentially be watched at all times with only one guard. Worse, the prisoners can’t know if they’re being watched or not. He described it himself as &lt;strong&gt;“a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ads-affect-the-very-content-of-the-media-that-hostthem&#34;&gt;ADS AFFECT THE VERY CONTENT OF THE MEDIA THAT HOST THEM
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertisements also affect the media that host them. Some of the effects are quite obvious — such as finding the space for ads (ads break, banner…) but &lt;strong&gt;the most damaging effects are also the less prominent ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, because the content is tied to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/advertisement&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt;, the content creator must follow a &lt;strong&gt;“advertiser-friendly” guideline&lt;/strong&gt;. Media are now competing with one another to host ads, and innovate to attract them: product placement, reality shows… (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=162&amp;amp;v=hr99HzCa0Kg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Publicitarisation — French&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;Everything is becoming a media&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv5WLF6UdZc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Depublicitarisation&lt;/a&gt;). Millions of people are voluntarily following brand accounts on social networks to receive a healthy daily dose of promotion (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZNOCKl-0Mc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hyperpublicitarisation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the free supported by ads model is costly. Advertisers are getting close to the media, restricting what can or cannot be said, topics, and schedules. &lt;strong&gt;Because of ads, diversity and quality of the media are reduced.&lt;/strong&gt; But there is more to it. Once ads are running, &lt;strong&gt;there is a strong incentive to stay compliant with dominant, advertiser-friendly framework&lt;/strong&gt; in order to retain and increase revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meant-to-bebig&#34;&gt;MEANT TO BE BIG
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have seen already, Facebook’s and others main profit driver is &lt;strong&gt;how addicted to their service, to maximize the time spent on it&lt;/strong&gt;. It can’t be balanced, &lt;strong&gt;it’s a design flaw&lt;/strong&gt;. When Zuckerberg speaks about Facebook’s ideals, and how he wishes to make it more honest and transparent, it’s no more than marketing and PR.On a market where two actors (Facebook and Google) hold more than half of the revenue of the whole industry, what can you do if your ad costs explode? Essentially, you have no alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Net digital advertising revenue share of major ad-selling online companies worldwide from 2016 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-edge-ofscale&#34;&gt;THE EDGE OF SCALE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not pleading for breaking down Facebook or Google. The result would eventually be the same a few years down the road. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;because of their business model, the GAFA are meant to be giants&lt;/strong&gt;. Behind the “big data” or whatever name they give to it are basically two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a robust system to collect data on consumers, organize it, tag it, and clean it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling the data after a form a processing (building audience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both those activities benefit hugely from scale&lt;/strong&gt;. For data collection, the bigger you are, the more present you will be which in the end multiply the opportunity to collect new data points. The ideal scenario here would a quasi-monopolistic situation where people can hardly avoid using your service (Hello Zuckie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reselling data, once again size does matter, a lot! &lt;strong&gt;Datasets scale twofold, both in terms of quantity and quality&lt;/strong&gt;. The bigger the dataset, the more people they cover, allowing the data reseller to reach new markets. Simultaneously, each new data point collected on a given individual allows the reseller to charge more, because of the precise targeting and personalization it allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the dataset covers more and more people, new correlations can be found, which in turn increase the amount of information available in any given person present in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it means, in an economic sense, is that &lt;strong&gt;each time Facebook register a new user, it benefits twice from it&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, it will increase its total amount of (active) user, which is the base multiplier of FB’s revenues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, because a bigger dataset allows drawing more insightful analysis, &lt;strong&gt;FB is able to increase its revenue per user (ARPU)&lt;/strong&gt; more for each data point it already has on one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook’s ARPU, 2015–2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARPU (Average Revenue per User) is an interesting metric to look at. It gives you an idea of &lt;strong&gt;how much money Facebook is actually able to extract from your data.&lt;/strong&gt; The ARPU is also strongly correlated on how detailed the database is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high ARPU could then indicate that Facebook has a very detailed file. With an ARPU of $26+ for the US and “up to 5,000 data points on 220 million Americans”, it seems to match. &lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, the ARPU is an indicator of the extent in which Facebook can be used to influence a population.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the growth of Facebook’s ARPU, it has been on exponential growth over the last four years. Once again, the real word seems to confirm the observation, as the role played by Facebook keep getting more important with each new ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Facebook’s average revenue per user as of 4th quarter 2017, by region (in U.S. dollars)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAFAs are now so big that each of their decisions has huge impacts&lt;/strong&gt;. Google and Facebook together are the biggest source of traffic for most websites. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.legrandsoir.info/un-nouvel-algorithme-de-google-limite-l-acces-aux-sites-web-progressistes-et-de-gauche.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;When Google slashes incoming traffic by 70% to a 20 years old left-leaning website — French&lt;/a&gt;, the World Socialist Web Site, &lt;strong&gt;it is a political action with real consequences on the political life of the country&lt;/strong&gt;. GAFAs are now the gatekeepers of the information online and make calls about what we see or not. Because of their size, their decisions have tremendous impacts on society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know about Facebook and other online services data collection practices, it’s time call the shots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we keep sacrificing our political power on the altar of convenience, or should we build our own decentralized social network services framework to prevent control and manipulation from hostile parties?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain opened a range of new options to build decentralized institutions we can trust. Some solutions are already working. We’ll see radical alternatives emerge over the upcoming years, &lt;strong&gt;it’s up to us to make the best of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2018 14:23:08 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/facebook-x-cambridge-analytica-the-hidden-cost-of-free-services/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2018/free-services/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Facebook X Cambridge Analytica : the hidden cost of free services" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month was a strange one. We saw mainstream media questioning &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/facebook&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and Cambridge Analytica practices after recent concerns over the US election. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/facebook-week-of-shame-data-breach-observer-revelations-zuckerberg-silence&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; sums it up in one frightening sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had manipulated the voters of democracies across the globe, notably in the US, with unsourced propaganda that was not necessarily true; and boasting of sting operations and honey traps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica took part in the yes for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/tagged/brexit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt; campaign, the election of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz’s campaign, and in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruz-campaign-paid-750000-to-psychographic-profiling-company/2015/10/19/6c83e508-743f-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;dozens of local election&lt;/a&gt; (44 apparently in 2014, just for the US). They are now a massive &lt;strong&gt;political force, engaged all across the globe with a strong&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-donor-for-data-119813&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;preference for conservative candidates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Cambridge Analytica was already &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_SlD7D_xug&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;advertising its services on Youtube since August 2015&lt;/a&gt;, they weren’t very secretive about their intent; here’s what they boast about in their promotional videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the American market, they claim to have &lt;strong&gt;“up to 5,000 data points on 220 million Americans”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We go beyond big data, we add an extra layer of personality data to &lt;strong&gt;get down to an individual level”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of Cambridge Analytica and its impact over elections have been well covered, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;such as in The Guardian’s Cambridge Analytica files&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;. Now, even Google will tell you:&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s less discussed is how could we even get to this point? Considering the company’s goals and practices, abuses should have been expected and prevented. Let’s broaden the discussion and address the tradeoff made with “free” services instead and the &lt;strong&gt;consequences of this data theft: a loss of political and personal power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-advertising-model-the-necessary-pain&#34;&gt;THE ADVERTISING MODEL: THE NECESSARY PAIN?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a quote from Mark Zuckerberg that got me started on this article. In the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ezra Klein Show&lt;/a&gt; when asked about the &lt;strong&gt;limits of Facebook’s current business model&lt;/strong&gt;, he didn’t exactly answer the question yet provided a fascinating response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not paying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the &lt;strong&gt;only rational model that can support building this service to reach people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presents the advertising-supported model &lt;strong&gt;as the only rational one able to bring free services to the world&lt;/strong&gt;. I would argue instead &lt;strong&gt;it’s only the easiest way&lt;/strong&gt;. Essentially, advertising allows generating revenue out of each/most users of the service. Because of the monetary incentive tied to ads, the provider tends to focus on collecting more data and increasing the user base even further instead of actual development of the service. It can’t be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they restlessly harness data, &lt;strong&gt;online services gain actual power and influence on individuals and societies&lt;/strong&gt;. Facebook is now the kingmaker, or is it already the king? If Facebook is king, it’s a sneaky one: he’s being secretive about its regal nature. They didn’t come public about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, they waited for the public to notice and patiently prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/16/mark-zuckerberg-new-facebook-manifesto-letter&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;In a manifesto written in 2017 about the future of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, he develops a grandiose and frightening vision for the social network, as &lt;strong&gt;“the social infrastructure for the global community”.&lt;/strong&gt; What we’re seeing today is only stage 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Facebook isn’t a lone wolf. There is a whole industry built on similar concepts: online advertising. While Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are probably at fault, many other companies such as Google, Yahoo, or Baidu have similar practices. A whole industry is at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-crookedindustry&#34;&gt;A CROOKED INDUSTRY
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advertising industry has always been ripe for abuse and scams, but &lt;strong&gt;digital advertising brought it to another level&lt;/strong&gt;. Abuses are common, both for advertisers and other actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the industry, you uncover several battles being lead all at once. First, &lt;strong&gt;shady practices are rampant in the industry&lt;/strong&gt;. On the advertiser side, botting and click-fraud are massive. To top this all up, users, annoyed by the evermore intrusive ads, are now fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abuses-and-shady-practices&#34;&gt;ABUSES AND SHADY PRACTICES
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abuses and misleading tactics are spread all around the industry on all kind of ads and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, apps and games may have &lt;strong&gt;aggressive data collection practices&lt;/strong&gt;, requiring unnecessary permissions (contacts, pictures, files…), which allow them to collect unnecessary data. Unsurprisingly, the Facebook app is among one of the most demanding in terms of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On desktop, there are intrusive banner ads and pop-ups all around deteriorating the browsing experience on the web. Worst, there are also much more intrusive practices such as &lt;strong&gt;spywares&lt;/strong&gt; (your beloved grandma’s toolbar) &lt;strong&gt;bundled with free softwares&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
A glimpse in toolbars’ hell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If scammy tactics are common for advertisers, brands pay the price for it as automated clicks are hard to distinguish for real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practically-in-a-civilwar&#34;&gt;PRACTICALLY IN A CIVIL WAR
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bots or automated activity is indeed massive in the online advertising world. It’s hard for brands to recognize these practices, and it allows the ad seller to increase their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA, why are they so many bots on Twitter? About 20% of all accounts are bots (fully automated), and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;at least 20% others use automated methods&lt;/a&gt;. So, if Twitter was to take actual measure against automated activity, it would risk losing up to 40% of the impressions it sells to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry itself is well aware of the issue, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/fb66c818-49a4-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;World Federation of Advertiser&lt;/a&gt; estimates that &lt;strong&gt;between 10 to 30% of the slots are never seen by consumers because of fraud&lt;/strong&gt;. The total loss is estimated at $50bn a year, roughly a third of the current online advertising industry yearly revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;users-are-fighting-backtoo&#34;&gt;USERS ARE FIGHTING BACK TOO
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the click fraud, you must add another stream of lost revenues for advertisers: users using an ad blocker. To protect themselves, surfers took matters in their own hand and developed Ad-Blockers extension, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-adblocker/gabbbocakeomblphkmmnoamkioajlkfo?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NanoBlock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;uBlock origin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering how intrusive and annoying ads have become, it was bound to happen. &lt;strong&gt;While adblockers minimize annoyance on the user side, it doesn’t solve the problem at all at the industry level.&lt;/strong&gt; Because less users now see the ads they host, media advertising revenues dwindle putting their very subsistence at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side, installing a Firefox/Chrome extension come easy for some, many don’t know about them or even about ad blockers. &lt;strong&gt;Only the most tech-savvy users tend to use ad blockers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;the ad industry is fighting back&lt;/strong&gt;, some websites are now blocking access to users with an ad blocker enabled. Luckily, blockers currently have the final world with anti-ad blocker defusers like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Nano Defender&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an ongoing back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising industry is mined by vicious circles of abuse that lead users to fight back. Since it lowers their revenues, media and advertisers are pushed towards even more intrusive advertising and data collection practices to try to break even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole advertising model is unsustainable. &lt;strong&gt;The actual consequences of the development of free services spread all the way down to the individual level. The tributes we pay is already massive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the abuses within the industry, the ongoing war with the users but most importantly &lt;strong&gt;the political clout claimed by online service which now makes them able to coerce public opinion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about Cambridge Analytica, it’s much bigger than this. I share &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/club-max/zuckerberg-in-dc-exposes-how-little-our-governments-understand-where-humanity-is-heading-b568607ab216&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Max Evans views&lt;/a&gt; on Zuckberg’s hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Words will be said, apologies noted, laws passed, but the problems will grow. Companies will not moderate their behaviour totally because they only have to accede to individual nations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the state is unfit to deal with this, &lt;strong&gt;we have but one option left: do something about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising model is not only tendentious but perverse. Is it really the only option Zuck, or just the one that happened to be proposed first and quietly established as a standard? &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BBerdah/growing-beyond-the-advertising-model-to-achieve-democracys-true-potential-5990de48a86f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>The Chatbot Masquerade: Crafting a personality with NLP and grammar</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2017 12:43:42 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/the-chatbot-masquerade-crafting-a-personality-with-nlp-and-grammar/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/img/2017/chatbot-masquerade/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post The Chatbot Masquerade: Crafting a personality with NLP and grammar" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are chatbots living up to their promises?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is complicated. While on the technical side bot-building frameworks, services, and libraries keep getting better, &lt;strong&gt;chatbots’ ability to understand their users and express themselves needs to be more refined for mass adoption&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s dig in to figure out the underlying challenges of natural language processing and achieving a natural-like expression. The chatbot industry is now worth millions (billions?), yet do you use chatbots daily? Do you know any friends that do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in to figure out the underlying challenges of natural language processing and achieving a natural-like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we do so, let’s state what’s on the menu. We’ll go back to the roots of chatbots, looking at what NLP really is and why it’s so hard. Then, we’ll look at currently available chatbots and analyze their shortcomings. With all this stated, we’ll be able to go back to the linguistics side of it and understand what is required to achieve a genuinely natural like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, loyal readers who stuck with me until the end can go a little further with the transcript of a quick exchange I had with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Suitpossum&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brett Scott&lt;/a&gt; while researching this article: we discuss the darker sides of chatbots — automation, speaker obfuscation, and data harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mainly two ways to build a chatbot: rule-based bots and chatbots relying on Artificial Intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule-based chatbots:&lt;/strong&gt; these are the simplest — &lt;strong&gt;if the user says A, the bot will say B&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, a weather bot will respond back with the weather in Los Angeles to the query “weather + LA.” Rules can have some flexibility built-in, to work correctly even if the user inputs the command with a typo for instance. However, the bot will not be able to process an unknown query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based chatbot:&lt;/strong&gt; this approach is entirely different. These bots can analyze the language of the user to extract meaning out of it and answer accordingly — they can &lt;strong&gt;process an unknown input&lt;/strong&gt;. To do so, AI-based chatbots use a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy seems too nice to be true? It’s because it is! Chatbots in the wild are quite often made of a &lt;strong&gt;mix of both approaches&lt;/strong&gt;: they follow a complex decision-tree logic and use NLP to &lt;strong&gt;make unknown statements fall back into one of the branches&lt;/strong&gt; of their tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree logic is straightforward so we won’t detail it in in-depth. What’s more interesting is Natural Language Processing. Besides, it’s not only a bot matter: &lt;strong&gt;NLP powers all form of automated language recognition&lt;/strong&gt;, ranging from sorting through a pile of resume to sentiment analysis on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;natural-language-processing-the-key-to-smartchatbots&#34;&gt;Natural language processing: the key to smart chatbots
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural language processing (NLP) is a way for computers to analyze, understand and derive meaning from human language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iCapps gives a pretty &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;clear and straightforward definition of NLP&lt;/a&gt; . Essentially, the goal of NLP is to create &lt;strong&gt;programs able to understand regular, every-day language inputs&lt;/strong&gt; instead of having the user pre-process his queries to make them understandable by a machine (The early “Siri” talk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, &lt;strong&gt;NLP relies on six key steps&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll detail what lies behind each of these steps to make the link between a written prompt to natural language expression analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tokenization&#34;&gt;Tokenization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before processing any written prompt, the text must be broken down into words and sentences to facilitate the analysis. In that regard, &lt;strong&gt;tokenization is pre-processing&lt;/strong&gt;: it identifies the basic units (words and sentences) that will be processed during the analysis. While this step may seem basic, the tokenization must be accurate for the rest of the analysis to be relevant. Indeed, since tokenization is the first step of NLP, &lt;strong&gt;errors made here will propagate and cause problems of interpretation later on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem basic (words are separated from each other by spaces, duh!) &lt;strong&gt;the reality of tokenization is more complex:&lt;/strong&gt; “Los Angeles” is an individual entity even though it’s made of two words. “I’m” is two words and two different ideas without any blank space between them. Besides, &lt;strong&gt;NLP techniques may be applied to “dirty texts”&lt;/strong&gt; — prompts that contain spelling mistakes, incorrect spacing, or improper use of punctuation — making it even trickier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, different methods of tokenization have been developed, each with their strengths and weaknesses. The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/nlp/entry/tokenization?lang=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;IBM’s developer blog article&lt;/a&gt; on the subject is a good starting point to learn more about it. &lt;strong&gt;Tokenization methods are not absolute&lt;/strong&gt;: they are chosen and adapted depending of the nature of text analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lexicalanalysis&#34;&gt;Lexical Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a successful tokenization process, the words are properly separated from each other. Naturally, the next step is to categorize the tokens to facilitate their processing. An effortless way to classify the tokens is to **use an already existing categorization of language **— the grammatical nature of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
_The linguistics behind chatbots — _&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s convenient because the match between a word and its grammatical nature is &lt;strong&gt;easily done using a dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;. On top of that, because grammar is the set of rules governing the composition of clauses and phrases in the language, sorting tokens with &lt;strong&gt;the grammatical criteria makes the following steps easier&lt;/strong&gt;, especially the next one: the syntactic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;syntactic-analysis&#34;&gt;Syntactic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tokenization and the lexical analysis happen at the word level, the syntactic analysis jumps to the sentence level to identify the relationship between each word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it takes you back to school: article + adjective(s) + noun = subject group and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2017/chatbot-masquerade/linguistics-2.png&#34;

&gt;
_The linguistics behind chatbots — _&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.icapps.com/the-linguistics-behind-chatbots/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;iCapps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;syntactic analysis provides order and structure of each sentence in the text.&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying the subjects, for instance, is particularly important for one of the following steps — discourse integration — which looks at the context around each sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;semanticanalysis&#34;&gt;Semantic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this step, the computer looks for the meaning of each word. What may once again seem like a &lt;strong&gt;simple step for a human&lt;/strong&gt; (we have dictionaries for this, duh!) is &lt;strong&gt;trickier for a computer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some words are straightforward and therefore easy to interpret — “monosemy” for instance is &lt;strong&gt;the perfect body and soul example&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s a noun referring &lt;strong&gt;exclusively&lt;/strong&gt; to “the property of having only one meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended meaning can be much harder to figure out for &lt;strong&gt;polysemic words&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/set&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;“Set” has 119 different meanings&lt;/a&gt; and can be used as a transitive or intransitive verb, a noun, an adjective, an interjection as well as taking part in verb phrases (such as “set back”) and in idioms (such as “all set”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous steps facilitate this one to some extent. Indeed, if we know that “set” is used as a noun, we’re down to 28 possible different meanings. &lt;strong&gt;Context is crucial here to find out the meaning intended by the speaker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discourse-integration&#34;&gt;Discourse Integration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discourse integration looks at the &lt;strong&gt;significance of the sentences compared to the preceding sentences&lt;/strong&gt;. Cohesion between following sentences of the text is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the key lies in &lt;strong&gt;pronouns which must be correctly recognized as such and then linked to the relevant antecedent&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, in the following statement the computer needs to be able to properly recognize “it” and link it to “Google”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is a search engine. It helps individuals find the information they are looking for online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this example is really straightforward. Yet, a real, natural sentence rarely is. Anaphoric references can be hard to interpret, &lt;strong&gt;especially in natural language where pronouns antecedents can be unclear or missing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pragmatic-analysis&#34;&gt;Pragmatic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragmatics study the ways context contributes to meaning. &lt;strong&gt;It’s the step going from what is said to what is meant&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the hardest of the six steps. Ambiguity is hard to handle with computers, yet this is all we do while we humans talk. Depending on languages and situations, context can be more or less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even human linguists have a tough time defining methods to analyze what meaning is brought by the context. &lt;strong&gt;Diverse theories emerged to account for the referential use of language&lt;/strong&gt; such as Jakobson’s six functions of language (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobson%27s_functions_of_language&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Referential, Poetic, Emotive, Conative, Phatic and Metalingual&lt;/a&gt;) or the Speech Act Theory (Which &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;studies performative utterances &lt;/a&gt;— a statement that produces an act by itself such as “The meeting is now adjourned.). Defining what is context is already a hard job for a linguist; &lt;strong&gt;contextual awareness is arguably the hardest part of NLP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-they-fail-the-seven-sins-ofchatbots&#34;&gt;Why do they fail? The seven sins of chatbots
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently available chatbots most often fail to meet the expectations of users for reasons ranging from &lt;strong&gt;design issues to technical limitations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chatbot.fail/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Fabricio from UXdesign.cc&lt;/a&gt; sums up, predominantly from a design perspective, the seven sins of chatbots. Here’s my take on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limited-ai-availability&#34;&gt;Limited AI availability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though NLP platform and libraries are becoming more accessible and common, &lt;strong&gt;AI is still hard and costly to implement.&lt;/strong&gt; What this means is that despite the technological hype behind chatbots, &lt;strong&gt;a large part of the currently deployed bot base is still relying on a word-triggered, decision-tree logic to answer the queries&lt;/strong&gt;. This type of bot is only as intelligent as the thoroughness of the person who designed the tree and his ability to anticipate potential use cases and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these bots might be efficient in certain specific contexts, they also &lt;strong&gt;quickly generate frustration because of their lack of linguistic capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;. They are quite often at a loss when faced with the way we talk in the real world: abbreviations, ungrammatical phrasing, spelling mistakes… Moreover, because of their tree-based decision logic, &lt;strong&gt;they are not able to respond appropriately to non-anticipated use cases&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-use-cases-really-thatstrong&#34;&gt;Are use cases really that strong?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When innovative technologies are emerging, they tend to generate a particular excitation among the developers’ and designers’ communities. Just like the apps, or the website before that, &lt;strong&gt;chatbots are becoming a must-have for any business who wishes to appear innovative&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a &lt;strong&gt;chatbot gold-rush&lt;/strong&gt; leading to the development of bots solving irrelevant use cases or offering sub-par customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a &lt;strong&gt;multiplication of ill-conceived bots&lt;/strong&gt; either missing to fit a real use case or just doing it worse that the existing solutions (sites, apps): dad jokes bots, personal florist bots, weather bots… See Darren Orf’s hall of horrors on the matter: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/facebook-messenger-chatbots-are-more-frustrating-than-h-1770732045&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Good chatbots, on the other hand, are those who &lt;strong&gt;solve a problem in a more convenient and straightforward way that websites or apps would have done.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kipsearch/kip-for-slack-edc84908f298&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Kip is a Slack bot&lt;/a&gt; made to simplify the handling of grocery and food collective orders at the office. The &lt;strong&gt;efficient usage of Slack’s built-in functions&lt;/strong&gt; allows @Kiptalk to be handy and reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-transparency-whowhom-am-i-talkingto&#34;&gt;Lack of transparency: Who/Whom am I talking to?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way chatbots present themselves frame the user interaction&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though bot-makers want to make them feel as human as possible, they must remember the importance of setting up the right expectations. &lt;strong&gt;People are empathetic towards other people, not machines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice between a “humanized bot” and a bot assuming his mechanical identity is hard; essentially, it boils down to the relationship you’re looking to build between your chatbot and its users. &lt;strong&gt;Users tend to be more patient and willing to tolerate mistakes made by a bot who’s honest about its robotic nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giving bots generic pre-made answers to use while he doesn’t understand a query can help maintain the conversation flow, &lt;strong&gt;does it help to build trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-context-awareness&#34;&gt;Lack of context awareness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human conversation is hard to replicate because of its &lt;strong&gt;reliance on context:&lt;/strong&gt; we use and understand sarcasm, adapt our way of chatting depending on the channels and the persons we address (see &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.signosemio.com/jakobson/functions-of-language.asp&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jakobson’s phatic function of language&lt;/a&gt;) and can read between the lines. Bots can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a friend coming over to your place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend_: “Do you have beers?”_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You_: “Help yourself.”_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nothing more than these two words, your friend infers that you do have beers, that they’re probably in their usual place and he can grab one or two if you’re drinking too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure chatbot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is asking for your location at every query.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bots that are not powered by natural language processing technologies can’t hold contextual information for a long time. &lt;strong&gt;They may lose track of what the customer is saying before he asks his question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this shortcoming, we can’t exchange with the bot naturally, &lt;strong&gt;we must adapt our prompt&lt;/strong&gt; to include location each time we ask him something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-communications-with-existing-businesssystems&#34;&gt;Lack of communications with existing business systems
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be efficient, &lt;strong&gt;bots need to be able to interact with current business processes&lt;/strong&gt; instead of creating new ones. Ultimately, chatbots are part of a broad ecosystem constituted of numerous touch points between customers and brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a chatbot operating in silo not only hurts the bot’s ability to process and respond to users’ queries; it also makes it harder &lt;strong&gt;for the business to handle the requests generated by the bot channels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only bots able to interact with pre-existing business processes can consistently produce value&lt;/strong&gt;, such as Kip discussed before: he orders the item specified on the grocery list collected with Slack using Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-offocus&#34;&gt;Lack of focus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient bots tackle specific issues where they can provide more value than their pre-existing counterparts&lt;/strong&gt; (website, apps, or any other mode of interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pre-existing channels to solve the defined user problem must be thoroughly studied&lt;/strong&gt; to make a chatbot that is an improvement regarding the design and efficiency of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, lack of focus can result in a bot that is both hard to develop and to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lack-of-human-escalation-protocol&#34;&gt;Lack of human escalation protocol
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bots are not the answer to all customer interactions. Even though the temptation of automation is understandable for businesses with many clients, &lt;strong&gt;there are always situations where a human touch is required&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These situations must be thought of and included in the bots’ decision tree/actions. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;without proper escalation, these situations result in a user left hanging&lt;/strong&gt;, probably frustrated by their unsuccessful interaction with the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current dominant business perspective tends to see &lt;strong&gt;chatbots as a way to reduce the need for real humans to handle customer interaction&lt;/strong&gt;. The truth of efficient and engaging bots is the opposite: they’re used to create a new interaction channel where a real person will be available if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of what NLP is, from a linguistic perspective and why primary reasons behind current bots’ failure, it’s time to go back to the linguistics and explore what bots need to achieve a truly natural-like expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since linguistics features vary per language, we’ll focus only on English, which is the most common language for bots and the one for which the research is the most advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-achieve-truly-natural-like-expression&#34;&gt;How to achieve truly natural-like expression?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;vocabulary-quantity-is-easy-polysemy-isnot&#34;&gt;Vocabulary: quantity is easy, polysemy is not
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the estimates and the way a “word” is defined, there are around 500,000 words in the English language. &lt;strong&gt;Most of them are very rarely used&lt;/strong&gt;: they may be obsolete, part of a field-specific jargon or register-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, an educated native English speaker has an active vocabulary of roughly 50 000 words (Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269554913_Words_in_the_Mind_An_Introduction_to_the_Mental_Lexicon&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jean Aitchison and Detlef Stark&lt;/a&gt;). Once again, out of these 50,000 words, &lt;strong&gt;few of them make for most of our texts&lt;/strong&gt;. Frequently used words include the most flexible: verbs, prepositions, and pronouns. &lt;strong&gt;Research indicates that 2,145 words account for 80% of all English text (&lt;strong&gt;The linguistic accuracy of chatbots: Usability from an ESL perspective — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272536147_The_linguistic_accuracy_of_chatbots_Usability_from_an_ESL_perspective&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;David Coniam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the analysis of the semantic analysis challenges proved, the difficulty does not lie in the quantity of vocabulary to apprehend but in its flexibility: &lt;strong&gt;polysemy is tough to compute&lt;/strong&gt;. We have access to context to sort out between the dozens of potential meanings of a word to find the one relevant to our current situation. Currently, chatbots have little to no context awareness; &lt;strong&gt;they must rely on other strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-maxims-of-an-honestchatbot&#34;&gt;The maxims of an honest chatbot
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we talk, a lot of the transmission of meaning happens by the choice we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When photographer takes a picture, he gives it an angle, saturation, a particular framing — ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;he translates his perspective, his view to what is in the most basic sense a very truthful representation of the real world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do the same with language. We choose to talk about certain things and not others, use specific words to refer to what we meant, order these words a certain way among all the possibilities… &lt;strong&gt;Those choices carry meaning by themselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we’re left to guess why the person talking to you made these linguistic choices. &lt;strong&gt;Our analysis is not purely intuitive or random&lt;/strong&gt;. To understand the implicature of prompts (the implied meaning) we rely on a few fundamental principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Herbert Paul Grice&lt;/a&gt; studied semantics and is well known for his theory of implicature. He isolated four main maxims we use to understand implicatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Quantity&lt;/strong&gt; — we make the information we give as informative as required (for the current purpose of the exchange), but not too detailed (which would hinder comprehension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Quality&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to make a contribution that is true. Which means to omit saying what we believe is false but also avoid talking while lacking sufficient evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Relevance&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to stay relevant and say things that are pertinent within the context of the discussion… A tough one for a bot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxim of Manner&lt;/strong&gt; — we try to make ourselves easy to understand. This means to stay as concise as possible, avoid ambiguity, make ourselves clear and try to stay orderly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have an intuitive understanding of these maxims and expect every speaker we encounter to follow them as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. While the people we talk with don’t do so, we tend to get frustrated by the exchange which becomes either hard to follow (too much quantity / not enough quality / not relevant enough / lack of manners) or not informative enough (lack of quantity or quality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to expect that &lt;strong&gt;we hold the chatbots&lt;/strong&gt; — if they are natural enough — &lt;strong&gt;up to the same standards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bots-self-reference-whatwho-are-we-talkingto&#34;&gt;The bot’s self-reference: what/who are we talking to?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the advanced tech behind chatbots, the though-process on their design and “personality” is still at a very early stage. Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the submissive female persona in still very prevalent in bots&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, bots who can process and answer queries with audio predominantly adopt a female voice for speech generation. Siri, probably the most famous virtual assistant was released at first with a female voice in 2011. The option to give a male voice to Siri only came two years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bot-builders avoid the gender definition issue by crafting gender neutral persona. For instance, Kip, the slackbot discussed earlier use a penguin mascot as its persona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, bot builders have three options when it comes to the chatbot self-reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid it all together&lt;/strong&gt;: diverse self-reference avoidance strategies can be enforced such as using a gender-neutral mascot, or producing an evasive answer when the bot is asked directly what its gender is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the first person singular pronoun “I”&lt;/strong&gt;: although the “I” is the simplest way to deal with this question, &lt;strong&gt;it also sets elevated expectations for the customers&lt;/strong&gt;. If the bot fails to display a real personality, its self-reference might come up as purely artificial .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the first person singular pronoun “We”&lt;/strong&gt;: “we” can seem as a good middle ground. It might refer to the team behind the bot, or simply the team the bot is impersonating (such as the bank employees for a bank clerk bot). Yet, “we” has been already widely used to make business communications sound friendlier; &lt;strong&gt;a chatbot referring to himself as “we” might suffer from the “corporate we” fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wallis and Emma Norling researched &lt;strong&gt;the impact of social intelligence, or the lack thereof in conversational agents to deal with problematic situations&lt;/strong&gt; such as a rude callers (The Trouble with Chatbots: social skills in a social world — &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~pelachau/AISB05/final/WalNor05.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Peter Wallis and Emma Norling&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;They highlighted the need for chatbots to be able to “play the game” to efficiently de-escalate conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An approach described in a forthcoming paper is based on the idea that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;emotions are basically a means of signaling escalation in conflict&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Although lions can inflict life-threatening injuries on each other, fights usually stop well before this happens. In the same way,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;an abusive response might be a signal that the agent is willing to (emotionally) hurt the human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and that the human had better stop soon or risk being hurt. Although a human might not have any inhibitions about ‘hurting the feelings’ of a machine,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;_they might feel differently about being called a moron themselves _&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;— even if it is by a machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter Wallis and Emma Norling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-search-for-the-honestbot&#34;&gt;In search for the Honest Bot
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to get personal and emotionally invested with chatbots. Chatbotslife carried out an analysis of 10 billion messages sent to bots and noted that about 10% of bots receive an ‘I love you’ or ‘I hate you’ type of message.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;&lt;em&gt;Chatbotslife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is at stake behind the question of chatbots’ self-reference. Humans tend to mystify objects — &lt;strong&gt;we see objects for more than their mere physical existence&lt;/strong&gt;: a Coke is not just soda, it’s a lifestyle. Brett Scott discusses this process called fetishization in his article &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://howwegettonext.com/if-you-talk-to-bots-youre-talking-to-their-bosses-cd8e390c242f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;If You Talk to Bots, You’re Talking to Their Bosses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;the emergence of chatbots pushes the boundaries of corporate personhood&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies already have legal personalities; bots can give them another layer of pseudo-humanity with a conversational and artificial personality blurring, even more, the frontier between corporations and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honest Bot does not currently exist. The new wave of bots are — to use a term popularized by the existentialist misfit Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye — the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ultimate phonies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. They’ll pretend to be friendly, to be cool, to be serious, to be insightful, and even to be self-reflective. But they’ll never just be themselves. Because,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the end, there is no “I.” There is only a company, its shares held by who knows who, possibly registered in Panama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brett Scott&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bots are now mostly seen as a new, practical way for the consumer to interact with brands, the search for the honest bot showcases the deep stakes of the chatbot industry. &lt;strong&gt;As the personalization of chatbots gets more and more precise, so does the data collected on each user&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can end up being resold and consolidated with other databases fulfilling the economic agenda of the bot’s owners and bot-platforms. The end-user might be left even more vulnerable than before to intrusive data-collection and advertising methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to &lt;strong&gt;question what are the benefits to be gained from chatbots and who will harness those benefits&lt;/strong&gt;. We should remain alert towards the hype and make sure we truly benefit from bots, not the other way around. Once they’ll be part of our everyday life, it’ll already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was researching this article, I had the chance to have a quick exchange with Brett Scott about chatbots’ perceived roles and their current limitations. I figured it would be a good way to wrap this one up, as &lt;strong&gt;we discuss some themes addressed by this article and explore a few others that are related&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks again Brett for the quality insights! &lt;br&gt;
Here is the transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do brands crave chatbots because they are looking at automating certain positions (support, customer relations, etc.) previously handled by real, human workers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New companies that have never hired front-line workers and that are **starting out with an automated customer process **— a lot of Silicon Valley companies are like this e.g. AirBnB has never had actual customer-facing staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old companies that previously have had front-line customer-facing workers and who are now looking to provide a &lt;strong&gt;lower-cost option&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially with a view to &lt;strong&gt;eventually getting rid of the front-line workers&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. a lot of banks are like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the latter context, the chatbot is seen as a more &lt;strong&gt;‘human’ experience’&lt;/strong&gt; than just giving them a webpage or app with options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isn’t the lack of human touch frustrating considering the current state of chatbots? Are chatbots a real improvement in terms of UX?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of whether the UX is authentically improved, I don’t know — I suspect a &lt;strong&gt;significant number of people could find chatbots pretty irritating&lt;/strong&gt;, and might just prefer a normal interface. The key difference with the normal interface though, is that it limits your queries through predefined categories, whereas the chatbot creates the &lt;strong&gt;illusion of being able to request or ask anything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess then the NLP stuff is about being able to fit those badly-spelled or strangely phrased queries into predefined categories that can be answered (as far as I know chatbots cannot yet improvise or make up answers or engage in spontaneous actions — &lt;strong&gt;they can only learn to take in unpredictable inputs and give out predictable outputs&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a brand perspective, chatbots embody a new interface to interact with customers. What are the characteristics of chatbots — as interfaces — compared to the usual ones (website, apps…)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can have a general critique of interfaces in that &lt;strong&gt;they obscure what goes on behind them&lt;/strong&gt; and we might argue that the chatbot is particularly good at that because it presents &lt;strong&gt;a human or ‘confidential’ persona&lt;/strong&gt; that lulls the user into thinking they are actually just interacting with a ‘being’ rather than an IT system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is data the main driver of chatbots’ adoption? — Are companies looking forward to implement chatbots because it allows them to collect even more data on their users?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure if the data extracted in this process is going to be greater than with any other digital interface, but perhaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
