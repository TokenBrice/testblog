<p><strong>DeFi France is a French-speaking community created to discuss decentralized finance.</strong> Every month, we organize a meeting to allow an instructive exchange to better understand fundamental elements of DeFi. After 6 face-to-face editions since October 2019, DeFi France is now held remotely. <strong>DeFi France is entirely held in French</strong> to help native speakers (sometimes not always at ease in English) to keep track and learn about the space.</p>
<p><img alt="defi-france-cover" src="../img/others/defifrance.png"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a community initiative led by <a href="https://twitter.com/mounibec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mounir Benchemled</a> (creator of <a href="https://paraswap.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraswap</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/arthurmicoulet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Micoulet</a> (Head of Blockchain <a href="https://www.palo-it.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PALO-IT</a>) and your humble servant (<a href="https://twitter.com/TokenBrice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TokenBrice</a>), as well thanks to the amazing support of the French community:  Pascal, Marc, Alexandre &amp; many others !</p>
